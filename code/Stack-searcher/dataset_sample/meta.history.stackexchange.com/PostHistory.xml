The question referenced lacks an academic historical air to it and is instead asking the history of a certain *breed* of plant.

But it couldn't have happened overnight. So when did this change actually happen? How long did various armies hold onto them and why? Now we know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions are [far too complicated to be researched in full here](http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/71/why-did-hitler-attack-the-soviet-union-when-he-was-still-busy-fighting-britain). Still, bringing together the different points of view and discussing them does create value because everywhere else you get one point of view and no alternatives. Oh, and I changed my opinion into the exact opposite after researching that question - oops...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But sometimes we seem to dig up something that is genuinely new. Up until now if you asked which Confederate state contributed the most soldiers to the army you were bound to end up with North Carolina. [Here](http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/169/which-confederate-state-provided-the-most-troops-in-the-american-civil-war/394#394) we don't only have the correct answer and an explanation as to why the numbers are unreliable, but also the most likely source of the North Carolina theory - some facts have been put together than only existed separately before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think that it is a problem of scope. Some questions are simply already well-researched, e.g. [history of flight](http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/365/first-recorded-use-of-aerial-weapons-in-warfare). This is bound to result in lame answers that mostly point to the (easily found) references. As with other SE sites, we need to require research effort here - including showing where you already tried to find the answer." />

It's been suggested that since &quot;History&quot; is a chronological account of events past, there are really **no *problems* to solve**, per se. It's a bunch of reference material for your to look up and share.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If that ^^^ statement above doesn't make your blood boil, **we're probably building this site for the wrong audience.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;History is *not* about asking about past events. The *FIELD* of history (to an expert *historian*) is about scholars who examine and analyze events and perform objective investigations, determine cause and effect, look for apparent biases, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Is this site about history trivia?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We've already talked about answers that just regurgitate content from other sources ([Warning about answers that just copy online sources](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/3/warning-about-answers-that-just-copy-online-sources)). But the *actual* problem is not that answers are being copied&amp;hellip; It's that the **questions solicit answers that are *eminently* copyable.** Many of the questions sound as though they're written by students the night before their essays are due. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I honestly don't know what an expert historian does all day, but I'm quite sure they don't sit around quoting encyclopedia articles. So my question is this&amp;hellip;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Finally, a question&amp;hellip;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll make this a free-for-all, pile-in-your-thoughts question on any of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - What are *you* getting out of this site? &#xD;&#xA; - Why should it exist? &#xD;&#xA; - What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better? &#xD;&#xA; - Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the history experts on this site don't have problems to solve that aren't already well-documented in &quot;General Reference&quot; sources, this site has already failed. We don't need a site that only adds another level of indirection between the question and the cited answer. We need a site that does something more. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is that &quot;something more&quot;?" />

With this in mind, it is expected that someone who is posting should have read the relevant portions of the Wikipedia article, or some other article that yields the same information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not to say that some fact being in Wikipedia revokes its eligibility as a question. Questions about how and why are going to bring out an excellent answer even (perhaps especially) when the who, when, and what are factually available. Often times, these how and why questions are available in the Wikipedia article, but are suspect or incomplete.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I do not believe a blanket statement of &quot;anything answered by a Wikipedia article&quot; to be correct as you state it. I do, however, believe the spirit of your request, which I interpret to be &quot;to keep the level of expected excellence of questions sufficiently high to bring experts&quot;, to be spot on." />

It is in the nature of history that there are large uncertainties. There are some events that can be considered a fact: they were confirmed by multiple independent sources so we are mostly sure that they indeed happened. On the other end of the scale are events that *might* have happened but there is little to no actual evidence that they did (or even indirect evidence suggesting that they didn't). Your questions tend to target the uncertain end of the scale and you expect definitive answers - this isn't going to work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Say for example, somebody asked &quot;Did Caesar plan to invade America?&quot; The only possible answer to this question is: &quot;very unlikely&quot;. But one can of course spin a theory about some Roman ships that sailed for Egypt but accidentally got to the New World (it *could* have happened, right?), left no evidence of them being there, got back safely and managed to tell Caesar about their discovery. Which prompted Caesar to think about a military campaign, without leaving any written evidence of course. Unlikely? Yes. Possible to disprove? Since we don't have a letter from Caesar stating &quot;I never wanted to invade America and I didn't even know it existed&quot; - probably not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can always spin a theory to &quot;prove&quot; any point you like which is why such theories aren't quite well-seen by people with serious interest in history.

I noted the issues and got &quot;are we trusting KGB now&quot; as a reply - conspiracy theory at its best.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This example shows that relying solely on the community to sort such things out will not work. Some arguments sound convincing enough to collect some upvotes - but that doesn't make them reasonable. And leaving such answers around, with upvotes and even accepted (because the OP is into conspiracy theories himself) will undermine any respect that this site might gain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that we should flag such answers. Indeed, I've done that with the following explanation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Conspiracy theory - listing &quot;facts&quot; that contradict pretty much all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the sources available, not willing to share any sources that support&#xD;&#xA;&gt; these statements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While requiring sources for everything might go too far, we should definitely ask for sources when we see statements that aren't obvious or common knowledge (meaning: not verified by a simple Google search).

And that flag would only show up in the moderation queue after two days, to check whether the author complied. But for now the manual process should do as well." />

As a moderator on another SE site, I saw someone answering questions that often mentioned the product he writes and sells. At first I was like &quot;ugh, this guy is peddling his product&quot; but after reading a post or two, I realized he was a very smart man who had researched his topic very, very thoroughly and was able to use his experience to help solve peoples problems. Then at the end he kindly put &quot;I solved this problem, and a few more, with my tool -yada yada-&quot;. If I would have dismissed his original research right then, three or four people that week would have had a tougher time with serious problems they were facing at work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But this is uniquely different than Skeptics. To the best of my knowledge (and I stand to be corrected) **there are no professional degrees, certifications, or other recognitions in ConspiracyTheoryOlogy&quot;**. While there are certainly plenty who devote their life to analyzing conspiracy theories (images of guys with huge bushy beards living in trailers in the mountains or underground bunkers come to mind) none of them are accredited by a university or professional trade organization or anything of the sort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We should take any original research from a non-professional with a grain of salt as amateur. This is not to say completely dismiss it, but to keep in mind that it did indeed come from an amateur. On Skeptics, due to the lack of any non-amateur by definition, it is very easy to say &quot;This will get out of hand, so we will require sources in all instances.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, we should also point out that Wikipedia does allow for research published elsewhere (journals, websites, etc) to edit the content to include as long as it's done so fairly. This fairness is enforced by the community who constantly review each page (which if you actually look, even the 'forgotten' pages have a fairly recent last update date!!) I imagine if someone on the Skeptics site had published an article in a professional and recognized science journal that they would be able to cite it, and perhaps even include other evidence not published there, based on their obvious professional and expert status.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, with the number of professionals we have (and certainly hope to have) we should keep original research on a long leash. That is to say, not unbounded. There should be an expectation that original research is either called out (on SO and other sites, I often put [citation needed] in the comments, especially when someone's like &quot;Java is slow, use assembly, man!&quot; or some other unfounded claim) or backed up by professional credentials. I would not be comfortable with someone being both professional and anonymous. If you want me to trust your original, unpublished research on THIS topic, I want to see your original *published* research on other topics. In other words, I want to see credible evidence of your ability to perform meaningful research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, laying down guidelines of what is and isn't allowed for original research will help us remain objective. If someone crosses what we define as the guidelines, we can gently point them here (and ideally this would belong in the FAQ, which we know all members of online communities read before they post, right?

The century tags give you exact periods. World War 2 happened at a very specific time.

This kind of effect is a bit more visible on other sites like Gaming, where we have &quot;old-games&quot; and &quot;retro-games&quot; tags that just no one is sure what counts as that because of how fast the game generations span out.

None of this is seriously disputed by historians. So it is a useful tag. From Wikipedia on [Antiquity][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Antiquity** (noun) and **ancient** (adjective) may refer to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -   any period before the Middle Ages, but still within the period of human history or prehistory. The term is most often used of [Classical Antiquity][3], the classical civilizations of the Mediterranean, especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -   &quot;[Ancient history][4]&quot; generally, and may be used of any historical period before the Middle Ages&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient Near East&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Late Antiquity is used of the period between classical antiquity and the Middle Ages&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        African Antiquity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient Iran (Persia)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient China&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient Egypt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient Greece&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient India (disambiguation)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient Japan&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient Rome&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient languages&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;        Ancient music&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, there is a fairly accepted definition of [Early Modern History][5], though the boundaries are slightly less clear:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In history, the early modern period of modern history follows the late Middle Ages. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the timeframe spans the period after the late portion of the Middle Ages (c. 1500) through the beginning of the Age of Revolutions (c. 1800).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I agree that perhaps Contemporary History (1800–present) will become obsolete eventually; but it will perhaps outlast this website, and the term is common among historians.

Also, please consider while many prof. experts on mathoverflow will love a book, you might lack any background or ability of abstract thinking to enjoy and understand that book. That's why we have special books for newbies, pupils, students, experts... these questions which book is the best are really pointless without stating what your background and current knowledge is imho and why internet is full of such questions. Every fact book has to fit a special audience to become successful, if not, there wouldn't be so much different books on the same topic. Economically proven ;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: Any (book) question on SE containing &quot;best&quot; in title without stating exact needs and personal background is likely to get my close &amp; downvote because of above explained &quot;mechanisms&quot;.

History.SE is about explaining developments, of course proving and gathering facts is the main work of a historian, but not his final goal. **Historians try to see the bigger picture.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, I think both sites would profitate from each other, if questions/answers link to each other for explaining developments vs. proving single facts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reasons to migrate to Skeptics.SE:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Proving/Disproving of facts, **existence of historical proofs** (Did Holocaust really happen, Did people really walk on the moon, 9/11...)&#xD;&#xA;- Questions about **statements** of single persons (which mostly do not cause/start/influence historical(politcal/social) developments, perhaps some notes/book written by this person does, but then, just read that book, e.g. Karl Marx)&#xD;&#xA;- the answer will likely be mono-causal, a **single but important fact often debunks a conspiracy theory**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reasons to migrate to History.SE:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- the question asks about historical **developments/situation** (thats what historical science is about, explaining and understanding coherently developments on **time scales of years and generations**)&#xD;&#xA;- the answer has not to prove/disprove facts, but to name all significant ones &amp; put them in a correct chronological order, **explaining development based on a historical(social/cultural/economical) context at that specific time**&#xD;&#xA;- the answer will be multi-causal and rather tries to explain rather than to prove, as historical sciences often deal with incomplete information and have to use plausibility and exclusion methods&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;If most agree with my rough points (not covering every special case), I would suggest to make this community wiki, so everybody can add further points.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This seems rather similar to the recent contest among the sites that did not really work, so I am not sure what the difference here is going to be.

But for all following weeks we want to take suggestions from you! It can be a war, time period, or any other significant historical event. Leave your suggestion as an answer to this meta post, and the topic that is voted the highest at the end of each round will be the topic of the following week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each round will be announced Monday morning at approximately 10 am EST.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**[Edit]**: World War 1 Week is now over. Congratulations to DVK for winning! We don't have a topic picked for the next contest yet, so if you have suggestions, please leave them as answers to this meta post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/140/would-you-be-interested-in-a-war-week-contest" />

But I couldn't find that question anywhere. The closest question was [this one][1], which was closed because of its argumentative nature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is the problem with this question - I think it can be very argumentative. But it is also fundamental to the field of history. I am new to this SE; I spend most of my time at MathSE or PhilSE. At MathSE, this type of question would (and has) survive if formulated properly. At PhilSE, it would not (I think). I think this is due to the continued use and support of use of Community Wiki (CW) for questions that are of questionable content, despite the general trend at SO to phase CW out. This, in turn, I attribute to the fact that MathSE has an incredibly large and active user base, so a few questions can be tossed in even if they do not fit perfectly within the SOP of the SE model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps I find the idea of asking a question about 'why studying history is useful' due to my background as a mathematician. As a mathematician, people often ask me why we bother studying math to the extent that we do (e.g. what do we ever do with geometry? Who really uses calculus, and why should high schoolers learn it? And so on...), and I answer it all the time. I suspect that historians can do the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So how should I formulate a question, addressing the importance of studying history, so that it will be acceptable on this SE?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/897/why-study-our-countrys-history" />

History very often has different versions. So, this one in the Wiki needn't be the correct one. So, everything depends on how deep we want to look into the question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example let't take the question &quot;when did WWII started?&quot; If the questioner seeks for a school answer, the official date from Wiki is enough. But he or she could be interested in the deeper understanding. Was Czechoslovakian annexe a real start? Or that of Czechoslovakians border regions after Munich? Or Austria annexe? Or, on the contrary, the war in Poland was only the preparation and the real start was in Norway, where really the Germans began the battle with one of the future winners? Or the June of 1941, when the sides were finally set? Wiki doesn't know the answer, it only could help with some information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I would set it otherwards. We could make a new tag, as &quot;official history&quot; or &quot;homework&quot; and if a question has it, the questioner needs the explanation on the schoolbook level. And let's not refuse a good answer for him or her. Children also need help. Maybe, the explanation in wiki on the question is too complicated for them. But if there is not such tag in the question, we should take it that the author seeks for a deeper knowledge and wiki could be taken only as one of many secondary sources.    " />

Many of the questions about history concern cause and effect and we simply don't fully yet know the long term effects of things close to us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, what is or isn't historically relevant has not yet been determined. Although the pressing political issues of our day may seem to be overwhelmingly important they could in fact turn out to be not that big of a deal when future generations look back upon our time period. Simply put we do not know what the future will deem important about our time. We can forecast all we want but then we aren't really engaging in historical analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those are my two cents on the issue, but really current events, are not as easily analyzed as historical events, which of course come with their own host of issues (sources, viewpoint bias, complexity) that make them almost as difficult to analyze." />

Such responses place undue weight on individual actors over the aforementioned historical forces which are a far more potent influence on their actions and thus of far more interest.  Furthermore, the resulting debate would be unfocused as where with a specific hypothesis, a more productive and interesting debate would follow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is obvious from the long list of questions asked in the post linked to by the asker are not so much historical questions as they are questions on specific military tactics of that particular age.  While there is a historical component to these tactics, many of these questions lack clear answers to the larger question asked (ie. &quot;could the axis powers have won if X?&quot;) and will virtually always lack clear answers.  This is because there is a myriad of potential variables which could intervene that go well beyond any particular tactical or even strategic decision.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even in the context of a specific military engagement there is always the countering question of what other actors would have done in response, which is often difficult to answer.  Even if a logical outcome can be determined based on a specific tactic, it then becomes necessary to explain how this would effect the larger environment and in such a fashion more and more speculation is required.  It is more conducive to a productive historical debate to isolate a variable &lt;i&gt;to the highest degree possible&lt;/i&gt;.  What if questions effectively do the opposite. " />

It is the voting and comments to improve questions that help the site, nasty comments and personal attacks don't enhance the questions and/or answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;History is very interpretive, looking at each incident means having an open mind and thinking of the events that led there.  Each person will also have their own unique view on events and incidents, if you do not agree and you can't find a way to enhance the question then leave it.  Of course if a question needs improvement then feel free to vote down and comment why you think the question needs improvement, the comments help everyone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep an open mind as more people with different viewpoints and different experiences will come here, its a place to learn not to attack.

Personally, when I encounter questions I would like to ask but have a &quot;gut check&quot; that says I should think about it then either my question is ill-formed or ill-suited.  When framed correctly historical questions can typically be answered, but usually there is not just one correct answer, in many ways thats where I feel the History SE site sort of diverges.  Since SE aims for one question with one correct answer it's hard to say if there is one that is the most correct, mostly I go with the most suitable.  Although I have seen many programming questions that don't have one correct answer either, so I don't fully think that History is that much of a divergence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes the risk is worth taking, if you have a question that has value and have an answer of equal value then feel free to put it forth.  There are a few examples of questions that were either closed, or considered ill-suited to the History SE site but elicited some very good and very high quality answers.

All the stats are nice, unfortunately most don't look to often on them or keep track of how they change. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as I read some of the currently closed sites showed a traffic decline, less questions doesn't seem to be main problem, considering there are [non-beta sites with around 3-5 questions per day][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What this site distinguishes from the closed ones is the amount of user with middle and high reputation putting effort into the site, very good answer ratio, healthy voting and meta discussion. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm a member of german.se, similar questions per day ratio for long time, but our traffic afaik grows slowly &amp; constantly as the user number.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the only real problem (legitimating a close) our site currently shows is lack of advertising and many history-geeks being more interested in their local history and debating/googling it in their national language. At least in Germany we have a lot of hobby archeologists etc, smaller history forums. Funnily, covering worldwide history often poorly and not showing interesting questions from people from the other side of the globe makes me often watch history.se. It's the most international history forum I know. If this site gets closed I will probably shut down my participation in many of the smaller stackexchange niche beta sites with similar stats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I would really like to see a comment/answer by the SE mods where we stand, simply shutting down sites without a warning, while other with very similar stats are kept open leaves me a bit perplexed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also showing a bit more history.se questions on the front page would be fair. I don't know what the criterions are for putting a question on the http://stackexchange.com/questions site.

My understanding is that SE evolved out of computer related questions and it would correlate with the way in which questions here are asked and answered.  I'm not necessarily saying that it the format is unworkable for history and other subjects, but it doesn't feel like it was designed for it.  Particularly, in subjects like history debate is an important part of the subject (granted this is to a lesser extent true in technical subjects, but you can't argue with the BSoD).  I'm surprised that the chat function hasn't been used here in 83 days, but I suppose that has to do with the lack of traffic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which leads me to my next point.  I think the bigger issue is that most of the people involved in SE, from my experience, seem to be people who have some sort of technical background.  They were ultimately drawn in from SE proper, CS, or similar sites.  Obviously this puts us at a disadvantage as experts in history are less likely to come to our corner of SE as opposed to say network professionals to the technical side of SE.  As an activist most of my friends graduated in social sciences and non-technical disciplines such as literature, my friends who are history majors have never heard of SE.

I was wondering what we could do to improve the site's performance.  Here are some thoughts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - We seem to be suffering from a lack of experts.  It seems like we should reach out to people who have an academic background in history.  It's good that we are getting quite a few people, like myself, who have an active interest in history, but no academic credentials, but it would certainly be good to have people who have devoted their careers to the study.  I don't know if this has been considered, but maybe we should reach out to the various history departments throughout the world?  It would be really nifty if professors asked questions here for their students to participate in.  This seems like a good example of us being able to use the &quot;technical-fetishism&quot; displayed by many academic institutions to our benefit.  Also, I'd imagine that many professors would have an inclination to help us advance the spread of historical interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Not only do we lack experts, as [Hauser notes in TED's thread][2], we also lack diversity in interest.  Again this could be improved by reaching out to institutions or various groups that have an interest in a specific historical field.  It would be nice if we could implement specialty into the site's mechanics, possibly by letting users select one or two historical fields to specialize in (or automatically selecting a specialty for users based on the tags of questions they answered, possibly modified by the reputation attached to each answer).  We could also have incentives for having uncommon specialties such as providing badges or incentive bonuses for a certain amount of posts for uncommon tags.             &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I don't know if this has been considered or if it's necessarily a good idea, but maybe offering users similar incentives as the above mentioned point for directing users to the site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway just some things to consider.

Shog9 [posted](http://meta.hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/312/68) in our meta that high-quality content and strong participation among core users were the primary factors for letting the site continue.  Like hermeneutics, history is somewhat of a niche topic (though not quite as esoteric) and somewhat removed from the Stack Exchange core audience of technical people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also appears that the SE management takes into account subject matter when they evaluate a site.  Literature seemed to have a lot of cross-over with the Science Fiction site, but I'm not sure there's much competition in the history space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Shog9 encouraged us to find more people like us to participate.  The problem is that if too many people stop participating, the site will cease to be viable.  So leaving the site open is a risk for the SE folks.

I've been withholding because I'm not sure *how* to vote. An up vote can express a few different things, such as “insightful!”, “well-written!”, “funny!”, “made me think!” or “well-researched!”. I see there's been some discussion about whether answers should provide [sources][1]/[references][2], and personally I think on a site dealing with history they really should. Especially since, if I understand the answers to [my earlier question][3] correctly, this site is not supposed to be a problem-oriented SE site where answers are mostly evaluated on their helpfulness, but an understanding-oriented SE site where answers are mostly evaluated on their accuracy. This puts me in a dilemma when seeing the many answers on this site that do seem “insightful” or “well-written” but which do not seem particularly “well-researched” because they don't provide any references. Should I up-vote anyway or withhold completely? It makes me wish I could do something like cast a half vote to incentivize the answerer to further improve the answer by providing references.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I have two questions really: (1) Should there be some way, that is not tangled up in the many different things an up vote can express, to incentivize answerers to provide well-researched answers? (2) If so, I assume an addition like half votes or any other site-specific mechanism (“scholarship ratings”?) is unlikely to be added to the SE software, but is there something else that could be done?

I left the comments there for now so that others can see them, but I plan to go back later and remove some of them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is a shame to see this happen, because the question has considerable merit and deserves to be a part of this site. If you find that you disagree with an answer then it is your responsibility to vote down that answer. I strongly encourage you to leave a comment to explain why you did so, because it helps everyone to udnerstand how to improve the site.

My reason for suggesting this is because 1) the comments will not be displayed anyway, and 2) if we get this many comments, then we need to look at other options, such as the Meta area or, preferably, the chat room. Any time we find ourselves having a lengthy discussion in the comments area, it really should be moved over to chat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as the time frame, I believe we have to option of one hour, one day, one week, or permanently. I chose one week for this particular question because I wanted to give everyone time to calm down and consider other options (like chat), and I also wanted to give people time to see what was going on and use this question as an example. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't want to lock it permanently because we are not allowed to vote, andswer, or comment on any question that is locked. This question deserves to be here,a nd I feel that it will merit additional voting. Furthermore, I believe there are still other possible answers out there, so I didn't wnat to lock it indefinitely. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would also like to remind people that you should vote a question or answer down because it doesn't have merit, is poorly worded, is off topic, or generally just doesn't belong here. I didn't see any comments for the question itself to indicate reasons for voting it down, and that is unfortunate because I feel that althought the question could be worded a little better to make it more appropriate, it is still a valid and pertinent question." />

Text="I just finished locking a question pertaining to the [death of Hitler][1]. I did this because there was a high volume of comments being made that were not really relevant, and to make matter worse, they were starting to take on a very personal slant, and that is simply not acceptable. I left the comments there for now so that others can see them, but I plan to go back later and remove some of them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is a shame to see this happen, because the question has considerable merit and deserves to be a part of this site. It is the responsibility of the community to help police this site, so if you see an answer that is clearly inaccurate or is totally unrelated to the question at hand, then downvote the answer. I strongly encourage you to leave a comment to explain why you did so, because it helps everyone to understand how to improve the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, comments that are directed at the person asking the question or others who have commented are not going to be tolerated. Personally, I feel that some of the negative votes were not justified and the explanations were weak, but I'll let them stand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said all this, the question I would like to pose to the community is this: Should we have a specific policy for deciding to lock a question, and if so, should there be a standard period of time for which it should remain locked?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edited to improve comments.

I completely agree that if things get personal then a lock is warranted and appropriate. My fear is that by locking questions that have lots of comments (not of a personal attack nature) it could stifle site interaction. Once the site has been around for a long time questions/answers may naturally acquire many comments. Are we then going to go back to old questions and lock them solely because they have reached a 12 comment limit? I think that personal attacks should be a hard standard, and spam commenting a loose standard." />

Basically, as a moderator I don't act on these unless the community at large indicates the need to do so.

If it something that is an abvious and major issue, I will close it and ask them to modify it. If they do so, then I will consider reopening it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the situation where there is a lot of discussion, I will usually freeze it for a while and post a comment advising folks to take it to the chat room. Once the freeze is lifted, if the discussions start back up, then I will either extend the freeze or close it to further comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, just use your best jedgement. If you have already voted on a question then don't worry about the negative feedback it is getting. That is part of the community process. We don't want to create a situation where we start following the herd. If the community as a whole decides to downvote it enough or recommend it for closing, then we act on that, and only that." />

As a mod, we can choose to edit the question ourselves, but speaking for myself, I tend to refrain from that on these types of questions. We will usually leave a comment for the original poster to suggest that they modify the question, and if that is done then we can consider reopening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Meta area is the right place to be to have this type of discussion. However, as Michael already pointed out, the mods often wait to see how the community reacts to a question before deciding to close it. I agree that this one was a borderline question. I could see how it only loosely fit within our guidelines and had considered closing it. I think Michael and I both tend to take the same approach, which is to allow the community to chime in first.

However, it would probably be more appropriate as a wiki topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, we as moderators prefer not to overextend our authority.

There is definitely no shortage of questions on this or any other SE site that could be considered sketchy, but we as moderators can't always act on every single one of them. We are volunteers who try to spend as much time as we can looking over the site and trying to keep it as current and relevant as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quite honestly, I personally do not ever read about 25% of the questions on this site when they are first submitted because I simply do not have the time. I eventually get around to reading all of them, but sometimes it may be a week or so after they are posted. I can't speak for other moderators, but I suspect they do not see most questions on the day they are submitted. (New answers are even harder to keep up with, but I won't go into that right now.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of our limited time, we rely on the community to help bring our attention to potential problems. They do this by voting to close a question or by flagging it if they believe there is something that needs to be addressed. Pretty much every single day I look at every question that is flagged or voted on for closing or reopening. Questions or answers submitted by new users are automatically flagged, as are answers to older questions, so all of these get my attention first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The short and simple answer is that this question got flagged and voted for closing, while most of the other questions did not. When we receive a flag, we have to make a decision based on a number of factors, and sometimes it comes down to just a personal evaluation. We are not always going to satsify everyone, but we certainly try.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, speaking for me personally, one of the first things I look at is the number of commenst vs. answers. This question has 9-0, which means it easily falls into the category of one that *will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion*. Those are easy decisions for me when it comes to a request to close!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another factor I consider is the number of votes (up or down) for either the question or any answers. Pretty much all of the examples you gave have good participation from the community, and as a moderator, we will very rarely do anything with one of those. At some point in the future as we get closer to becoming a full site, we will be required to clean up a lot of those or remove them, but until then the moderators are not going to act on them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We don't claim to have the perfect solution. It is simply one in which we rely largely on the community to help give us guidance. All of these factors are weighed individually (and quite honestly, sometimes with some personal prejudice) before we decide how to act on them. As long as the community remains active and provides their feedback, we will be there trying to help mold this site into what you guys want it to be." />

There are many technical reasons that a person might not be able to use the top-voted answer, so it's helpful to have a way of privileging a less popular answer that works for their specific situation.  It's a win-win because the asker can signal the answer that actually solved their problem and the community can signal the answer that is generally seen as &quot;best&quot;.  (Often it's the same answer, which is convenient.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I've noticed that some sites don't work that way.  On a site like History.SE, the asker might be the _worst_ person to pick a canonical answer.  Or at least, there's nothing special about the asker since they don't have any unique problems that need to be solved in an answer.  In a sense, the asker of a History question is not asking for themselves or their own circumstances, but for anyone who will use Google to search for answers.  When Joe Googler discovers that an answer has been accepted by History.SE (we can't expect him to know that accepted answers are chosen by the asker alone), he will naturally assume that the answer has been given some sort of stamp of approval.  That can be a mistaken assumption.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've floated [proposals][1] on [other sites][2] that have the same profile.  My plan is to develop a consensus across a number of sites in order to propose something on Meta.StackExchange.com.  A [comment][3] on an answer to one of my questions here, spurred me to bring this up here.  Obviously, I'm not really active here (yet?), but I get the sense that Accepted answers might be a stumbling block for users not intimately familiar with Stack Overflow.

An upvote is *not* the traditional welcoming gift (it's usually a nice comment). If a post by a new user is good and worthy, by all means, upvote it. If it's a so-so post or even just wrong, don't go sympathy upvoting to 'welcome' the user. Help him/her out by leaving a constructive comment. Vote for the post, not the user. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sympathy voting has two major problems: it encourages so-so to just wrong posts and it can remove all new user restrictions for that user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When a new user writes a not-so-great post and it's upvoted out of sympathy (rather than because it was a great post), the new user now has a distorted view of what is a quality post and what needs work. Leave a constructive comment to help them a along, but don't upvote the post because it's a first post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [New user restrictions][1] are removed at 10 rep. Sympathy upvoting an answer removes all of these restrictions, but the user has not really earned them. New user restrictions are precautionary measures.

While im trying to educate myself on history, in order to re-enact the proper way only with my own research, Id have to make several degrees in history and read through a few libraries. Just starting off with some questions off the top of my mind, since I started only recently&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**Why should it exist?**&#xD;&#xA;Why, to have and expert source of **up to date** knowledge about history. I cant possibly follow every archeological journal, specialist, publication, university, etc etc. We need a source of reliable, scientific, high quality knowledge. The truth is, popular books on history are simply swarimng with errors on almost every aspect. Some of the illustrations of medieval armour are more fantasy than history in books that are supposed to be educational! We need a place where we can ask for info and we will get facts, backed up with finding, iconography, documents from the period and expert analysis of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?**&#xD;&#xA;The internet is cluttered and even more erronous that the books. Most people write about how they imagine history (especially medieval and how its viewed by the prism of knight romances) rather than how it actually was. Also, everything mentioned in previous posts.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?** &#xD;&#xA;Well, maybe a bit. I looked through some of the questions on the site and I dont feel they are answerable in an expert manner. If someone asks about causality of some events, how one thing or person affected another etc. The answer will be either speculative, or would need an entire scientific article or book to write it down. Many questions are really difficult to answer, meaning - it would take an enormous effort to give a reasonable answer. Examples? http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2312/how-did-medieval-armies-survive-the-use-of-mail-armor-in-the-deserts-of-the-midd. The top rated answer took the right course - the scientific way would be to do experimental archeology. In Poland we actually have a group who does such things. They equip them selves nearly 100% historically (they even use hand-woven materials for their clothes) and travel by foot and by horse, eat historically prepped foot on such journes etc etc. They have gained a LOT of high quality knowlege about travelling in the middle ages. Right now theyre getting ready for a 400km journey on foot in the south of the country. Perhaps they could accurately answer the qeustion I linked, if they were to go Middle East ;) Im quite sure they could provide some great community-wiki questions and answers and Id love to see such people here. Im making some questions from the begginer/advanced reenactors point of view, but I feel my questions are of a totally different sort than most of the site. Maybe more such qeustions would interest real pro's? Theyre the sort of question you cant really answer simply flipping through Wikipedia and a book entidled &quot;Knights through history&quot;." />

As the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section says: **&quot;You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.&quot;** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems like you are asking how to ask subjective questions on this site. You might want to read this blog post from the Stack Exchange blog on &quot;[Good Subjective, Bad Subjective.][1]&quot; The post refers to the following six guidelines for drafting subjective questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  1. Great subjective questions inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  2. Great subjective questions tend to have long, not short, answers.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  3. Great subjective questions have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  4. Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over opinions.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  5. Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  6. Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are asking questions about what was [more important between a set of things][2] that isn't a good fit for the site. This site tries to focus on questions that can be answered objectively by referencing historical facts. Sometimes you may notice that questions ask &quot;what were the factors that contributed to this event,&quot; that may seem like a subjective question, because it is in part. However, that question differs from asking what is important, because it invites the person who answers to answer with factors, but not to make judgment calls amongst those factors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope all this makes sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7839/who-really-put-to-flight-american-hostages-in-americas-embassy-in-tehran-in-197" />

But again, one of the sites might be a better fit for any given specific question, depending on its exact historical quotient; even if it is on-topic on both.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Short version - you will be most at risk at being considered offtopic on History.SE if the question is purely political, and no historian or history enthusiast would possibly be interested in it from historical perspective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, please realize that there's a difference between &quot;offtopic for this site&quot; - but ontopic for Politics - and &quot;subjective question that does not belong on any SE site, because it can not be answered objectively, just discussed&quot;.

Well, they simply haven't been asked yet. History is a big subject of which US history is a small part, and the New Deal is a small part of that small part. Unless we happen to get some users who have an interest, and questions, on that particular small part of history, we won't have questions.

My involvement with another research-based site shows me that there are two definite shifts in how questions/answers are presented in academic sites and places like SE where the community is more involved in how reputation and answers are perceived.  Experts in some areas, and I can luckily say some of my history professors were not like this, can be prickly when their research and authority in subjects is attacked, which will happen in SE.  I've seen it happen in many questions on SE History as a mod, though it's a small portion of what I've seen it may be a stumbling block with others getting involved.  Especially considering the &quot;burn&quot; others may have had in previous exposures to SE sites and involvement in public forums like this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember these are people who spend their time as experts in subjects and some do not take direct challenges well to their knowledge of subjects.  While getting younger members of the community may help, as they are more familiar with the social media aspects of online communities and may have thicker skins for criticism that may arise.  Introducing them to SE History may be good, but the introduction has to draw them in, and I am not sure even the current state of SE History questions is enough to bring them in.  I know this goes back to the question quality problem we struggled with early on, and I can see it somewhat still happens, but then this is for people to have questions who may or may not be History professionals or academics, it's a place for answers.  Consider as well, that while we have stressed in the past that answers should have some documentation for them, not all do.  Many are someone's recollection or knowledge put out there, and some have sources to back up the statements, and many sources are not Wikipedia.  What would be the expectation of an academic who is more used to using sources to back up their thesis or paper?  This sort of loops back to the reputation aspect, here is someone who is already known in another community as knowledgable in their field but here they are starting over, many would not want to do that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll stop there as I feel I've dumped enough.

For this reason, I think a lot of people will accept an answer even if they don't believe it answers their question.

Sometimes there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Some times the question itself is somehow wrong (bad assumptions typically). Some times the question isn't really answerable with the knowledge available to us today (possibly the situation here). However, a &quot;redirection&quot; answer should probably make it clear that is what you are doing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As someone who has made rather a lot of &quot;not quite answer&quot; answers, downvotes on that technicality are just part of the price of doing business.

However, it seems to me that the historicity of the Qur'an and the New Testament when it pertains to the life of Jesus have opposite problems:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The Qur'an is clearly _not_ a useful source of historical information on Jesus because it's at best [third-hand information][1], written hundreds of years after the events, with clear biases that provides no truly independent information.  So the question really can only be answered in the negative.  It's not going to be constructive to ask, since any answer will likely be uninteresting to historians or attract controversy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The New Testament are secondary sources (with respect to Jesus), written within 100 years or so of the events, that provide independent information.  However, they have clear biases.  Writing a comprehensive answer would require a book (or even several) to pull apart all the issues.  On top of that, the specific question was poorly researched and cited one (very biased) website.  It just doesn't come across as an honest question.

While it makes obvious sense to replace tags with more specific ones as they become available, it doesn't serve anyone to have a thousand tags with one entry in them, either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the problems with a site simply called &quot;history&quot; is that there are many approaches to history. Some have an interest in a time period, others in a particular civilization or cultural group, others in an aspect of human society across time periods and civilizations, others in a particular school of analysis applicable to all of the above.  As the site is still in its relative infancy, we lack a complete set of tags for all those angles, (we don't even have [tag:angles]). Moreover, we are also limited to five tags per question, and there is no way to set up hierarchical relationships between tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the same time, a thousand tags with a single question in each doesn't make it easy to follow questions about the same topic. You subscribed to [tag:military] but didn't see my question? Well, silly, you should have subscribed to [tag:air-force] instead. No, wait, to [tag:aerial-bombardment]. Sorry, I meant [tag:strategic-bombing]. Well, I wouldn't have tagged it as *military*, since it's not a question about the entire military, right?.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, tags like [tag:europe] are not just for questions encompassing all of Europe, but for questions about topics within Europe that do not [yet] have a more specific tag, so that enthusiasts and experts in European history can have a go at them. Have a question about Henri IV? Great, tag it with [tag:france]. But a question about the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth? For now, I'd say tag it as [tag:europe], until we have a half-dozen questions just about the Commonwealth and can justify spitting it out as a specialty." />

The problem you may find in this case is will this person be willing to be the resource you would like them to be, or only provide information on their terms.  Unless you can get them to understand what the issues are around them, and judging from the posts I am just saw on here, I doubt you will be able to bridge that gap unless you can make a connection to diplomatically get the person on board with you.

If we discover these patterns in a given user’s voting history, we view all their downvotes for that user as suspect. They’re all silently deleted, and any lost reputation is restored to the unfortunate target of these downvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, it's the wrong question to be asking; if you need to know this, *you're doing it wrong.* Vote on the *content*, not the *person*. If you find yourself going through someone's profile down-voting everything they've written, stop and ask yourself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Is this person blatantly abusing the site by posting nothing but low-quality content? If so, **flag one of their posts for moderator attention** and explain the situation; they may need a talking-to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Have I become overly fixated on the personality of the person involved? Did they annoy me in some fashion, to where I'm now being exceptionally critical of their work vs. the work of others on the site? If so, **stop, walk *away* from your computer, and calm down.** You're not being objective, and this is likely skewing your voting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that moderators can't see individual votes - only patterns. If a moderator is chiding you for abusive voting, chances are the system has detected something unusual in how you're casting your votes; if you do not heed their advice and adjust your behavior, you'll probably find your votes invalidated and possibly even your account suspended.

I don't think such an approach is **required** for practical reasons on History.SE with the current moderators.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   There doesn't seem to be a lot of unjustified closing by mods on History.SE from my observation and having been on the site for well over a year as an active participant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. However, I very strongly feel that strongly limiting the ability of moderators to cast binding close votes is a great idea **as a concept** for all SE sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   On another SE site I have had a case where 3 of my questions closed unilaterally by the same mod in 1-2 day period. **2 of them were reopened after I raised the issue and explained why the mod was wrong on Meta** - the mod was wrong in both binding votes. I could probably have gotten #3 reopened as well but was too exhausted to bother. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   On a technical level, an ideal solution IMHO would be to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   - Limit binding closures to very special cases (e.g. closing as SPAM or offensive), where doing the closing **quickly** is of essence. On newer lower volume site, waiting for 2-3 high-rep users to get to the bad question can take a while.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   - In all other cases, force the 3-vote-binding-closing limit as discussed by Tom's question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   - Allow an easy reversal of binding authoritarian vote (e.g. one where there weren't 2 other high-rep users voting to close as well) via VTRO. In other words, even one (or may be two?) VTRO votes by people other than OP on a question unilaterally closed by a mod is enough to erase the mod's close vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     Just to be clear, this ONLY applies to cases where the mod is the only one VTCing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;" />

First, when you get down to that level of granularity there is probably more effort required to answer such a question, thus making it a better fit for the stack format.

I actually like the content per se.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not against using the site to research historical novels; I've written one or two (unpublished) ones myself. But I am critiquing the question from the point of view of a fellow amateur novelist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good question should be fairly narrow. A hypothetical question in my view might be something like this: &quot;Some of my older friends or inlaws know someone who escaped from Sobibor (a death camp) in World War II. My novel is about what happened to such an escapee afterward. But how did s/he escape in the first place?&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Sobibor&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ideally, the question would contain this link and ask for relevant details of the escape that the link doesn't provide. Here, the question is &quot;limited&quot; in scope insofar as it refers to one event that has a clear beginning and end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, the question about the &quot;Resistance&quot; in Czechoslovakia in 1938 is open-ended. First of all, there was NO &quot;Resistance&quot; in Czechoslovakia in 1938 when it was still a (nominally) independent country. The Cezch part of the country was taken over in March 1939, and the Resistance was organized later. And when the OP writes &quot;I need to know what happened to the hero,&quot; whom did he meet, what would he have done, etc. it's like asking a &quot;homework question.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An aspiring novelist is supposes to know these things! For us on SE to try to answer such a query is an invitation to a limitless set of answers. We would practically end up writing the novel itself, which is what we're NOT supposed to do on SE. A better question might be, would my hero have had a chance to meet President Benes at such and such a time and place. That, at least would be a question limited in scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have recently come to the conclusion that a good answer on an SE has the property of &quot;Turing completeness,&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness (i.e. comes to a halt). A good question will inspire &quot;Turing complete&quot; answers, while a bad one creates an &quot;infinite loop&quot; of answers. IMHO, the question has the latter, and not the former property.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where should we draw the line on questions of this sort? Should they be closed or not?

Can empirical work produce truth?  Can you read texts with veracity?  Importantly for the second sub-question: How?  Do you believe that it is possible to recreate hypothesised internal states in subjectivities through correct reading of the records of the subject's personality (psycho-history)?  Is it possible to accurately depict either in concrete or abstract the actual social forces of history via a correct reading of the records of the past (Thompson/Althusser debate)?  Do collective subjectivities exist, and if so are they the only body capable of a real knowledge of the actual process of capitalism (praxis/theory debate in Marxism)?  Is there a teleos?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;History, like other empirical engagements with material reality, is the least worst possible way of uncovering conditional and limited knowledge about the world.

On this site, &quot;not a real question&quot; means likely answers will not be &quot;Turing complete.&quot; And &quot;not constructive&quot; suggests the possibility for an &quot;infinite loop&quot; in the answers generated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To sum up, good topics are those that generate &quot;good&quot; (&quot;Turing complete,&quot; identification) answers, and bad topics are those that generate &quot;bad,&quot; (an infinite loop of essay-type) answers.

I'd say it's safe to say that questions from amateurs are allowed and more often than not, enthusiastically welcomed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, as [T.E.D. noted](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/579/739), we do expect questions to show at least some amount of prior research. We really don't want a site that's full of obvious answers, that would get extremely boring very fast. However it's extremely difficult to define a common baseline for the amount of prior research required. Each and every one of us has different standards, expectations and skills.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How do we maintain sanity, then? Well, that's easy, by combining our different standards, expectations and skills. It takes five votes from high(ish) rep users to close a question (i.e. deem it unsuitable), one or even four persons' opinions don't really mean much. I'd go as far as say that if you don't agree with one person's opinion of your question, you can just ignore it, at least until it becomes obvious what the community's opinion is. There's one notable exception, the people with diamonds next to their usernames; they are moderators exactly because we trust them to single handedly do stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although I don't think I'm in any way a representative user, just to give you an example, my workflow for determining prior research is a five minute search. I take the more important keywords from the question, enter them into Google and:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If I find the answer, I'll downvote the question and move on (remember: a downvote's primary purpose is to show the post is ill researched or ill defined). &#xD;&#xA;- If I find relevant information (but not the answer), I will comment and share that information (primarily to help anyone else researching the question). If I feel that information would have made the question clearer and was relatively easy to find, I'll probably downvote. &#xD;&#xA;- If I don't find anything, I _may_ upvote the question. &#xD;&#xA;- If I continue researching the question past the five minute threshold, I will most definitely upvote it. There aren't many questions that keep me interested for more than five minutes, and those that do deserve my upvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm guessing everyone has their own workflow, and I should note that (obviously) my workflow only applies to questions that aren't a mess to begin with. I wouldn't spend five minutes on rants (in disguise or not), _extremely_ trivial questions and questions in broken English (on these, my five minutes are better spent in editing the question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both your questions pass my &quot;five minute test&quot;. Obviously, the Australia one didn't pass someone else's equivalent test, but that's both understandable and expected. Some people on the site will be a lot more familiar with certain areas than others, and will be able to dig up relevant information and possibly the answer almost instantly. So what, as I've already mentioned, you shouldn't lose any sleep over what one person thinks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if you ignore the condescending tone of the comments, what remains is that someone familiar with the subject matter of your question answered it, almost immediately. I agree they could have been a bit nicer about it, but at the end of the day you found the information you were looking for. That's not so bad, is it? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, I'm not suggesting that the ends justify the means. The comments, although not outright rude, weren't particularly helpful and you could have just flagged them. Or, just ignore them. But saying that &quot;I do not think I will be able to write to the standards this site requires without getting an abrupt and condescending comment&quot; is an overreaction. I'd strongly advise against letting a single bad experience shape your opinion of the site, especially since you have found at least some value on the site (more specifically, the answer to your other question). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stick around, and give the site another chance. Keep in mind that it's extremely tough to convey emotion in comments. The person at the other end of the line might just be tired, or having a bad day, or whatever, and they screwed up with their comment. Or you might just be misinterpreting the comments. It doesn't matter, whatever the reason for a not so friendly comment, if it's just one (or even two), just ignore it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

(or stop   &#xD;&#xA;   Mugabe, or Bush, or Chavez, or whoever)?&quot; (If you're     going to ask&#xD;&#xA;   that, you need to define the world community in some    way; give me &#xD;&#xA;   a wikipedia link to the UN High Commissioner on Birthday    Cakes.)&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;What is the consensus of historians on ...(this picture of my&#xD;&#xA;   goldfish)?  If there is in fact a secret cabal of historians that&#xD;&#xA;   dictates opinions on history, nobody has informed me of it. &#xD;&#xA;   Questions like these are really invitations to debate. [Example][1]&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;When did you stop beating your wife (e.g. What is the timeframe for &#xD;&#xA;   adam and eve)&quot; If the question doesn't provide a timeframe, or&#xD;&#xA;   references a timeframe that is indeterminate, or a timeframe that&#xD;&#xA;   relies on assumptions that are not commonly accepted, then the&#xD;&#xA;   question is off topic - it is an invitation to write a fantasy novel.&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;Can you evaluate the impact of Sujarkama's theory of mesonic      &#xD;&#xA;   exchange entitlements on the gross national product of the Jawethi   &#xD;&#xA;   province of Kronos under Reaganomics?&quot; (i.e. Astoninishingly obscure &#xD;&#xA;   questions based on terms, concepts and papers that are **not cited**). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Update:  @DVK's assertion lingers in my mind and forces me to clarify that the key to why I believe these to be off topic is the absence of sources/citations.  If the questions are based on sources, then they're on topic. If they don't have sources, then these aren't questions about history, they're invitations to dialogue, or politics, or religion or something else. The difference between a meeting of historians and a meeting of a professional debate society is the respect and attention paid to the sources.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/5851/1401" />

The other problem is questions that rely on assumptions - like the assumption that I beat my wife, or that I'm married. [Example 1][6], [Example 2][7].  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Before you ask the question, doublecheck that the majority of the people accept all the assumptions.  Sometimes this will cause me to eat crow; there are questions where the assumptions aren't obvious.  But it is worth your while to take a moment to make sure that all the terms  in your question are meaningful to the audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Can you evaluate the impact of Sujarkama's theory of mesonic exchange entitlements on the gross national product of the Jawethi province of Kronos under Reaganomics?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask a question which relies on obscure details, **without citing those details** I will downvote you.

If you can't be bothered to cite your sources, then there is a gravitational force drawing my mouse to the downvote button.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Someone once said that... ; is that true?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two problems with this question, and I'll wish for the ability to downvote twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, cite your source. It makes a big difference if the &quot;someone&quot; who once said is a 3rd century monk, a member of the Nazi party in 1938, Paul Krugman, or Noam Chomsky. They all have different biases; they are reliable for different classes of fact. If you don't identify the source, then we're both playing darts in the dark, potentially in an open field.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second problem is that this is very close to the example given in the FAQ of a question _NOT_ to ask. &quot;your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”.

(I'm surprised given the question title).  Despite being ESL and a new user, the questioner cited an influence and asked a reasonable question.  Answers were satisfactory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;How widespread was the practice of chaining slave rowers to the ships?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Satisfactory.  Question is trivia and should have been bonked / majorly rewritten.  Answers are good.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;What was it like to have type 1 diabetes in the early 20th century?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off-topic.  It is asking a medical question, not a history of medicine question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Did the US government officially apologize for Indian Removal Act and Native American Indian genocide?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trivia.  Needs a rewrite for adequacy, chiefly lacking in appropriate context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;U.S. Marine Corps and Why does the Navy’s army need its own air force?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Should have been closed or migrated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* * *&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The running theme is the incredibly poor quality of questions, usually to do with trivia, lack of adequate context or reference, or requests for topics not related to history as such.  Heavily and major rewriting could save some of these, but they're not resulting in historical questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our community of answerers is doing better than our community of questioners, but this leaves good answers to bad questions: unsatisfying on the whole.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

(fortunately, H:SE is relatively good about community editing to refine a question; I think we could evolve to do better, but I think we do OK).

It does, however state that certain religions are inferior. While he may have insulted the _institution_ of several religions, he's not _directly_ insulting anyone for simply belonging to them.&#xD;&#xA; - It no longer displays a swastika. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm putting my personal beliefs and feelings aside while writing this, as a Stack Exchange community manager it is my job to be _completely_ objective in such evaluations, even at the cost of being wildly unpopular for doing so. This was a difficult decision to make. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the end of the day, it's the _reception_ of the text that creates needless angst and disruptions within the community. This isn't the first time we've been contacted regarding the text and we _only_ alter a user's profile when we feel that interceding is _absolutely_ necessary. Any technicality one could raise does not alter the fact that the _intent of the writing was to be deliberately hurtful_ or _hateful_, even just from the vantage point of the offended.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note, not _all_ of the text was removed, only the portion that I found to be the most egregious and deliberately offensive to people of certain religions.&#xD;&#xA;" />

But at the end of the day, it matters so little.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Eugene says &quot;Report it!&quot; as abuse. However, there is a theory that a user _may_ (even objectively and impartially) find one of your posts rubbish and have a look at some of your other posts and mark them down too. It isn't necessarily a vendetta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Downvotes are a really important part of the site, and help with site quality. As does closing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* You say you are not a mod so cannot see who is downvoting you. I'm almost certain mods can't see this either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A last point to justify commentless downvoting. If my downvote and comment is very aggressively challenged by the poster (leading to a long comment war) then I can feel put off adding a comment to the downvote the next time. In other words, to reflect your title - **a plea to downvoted posters** - don't take it too personally. Edit your post if you think the downvoting commenter makes a valid criticism.

However, when those questions start asking for &quot;other sources&quot; or &quot;other examples&quot;, they start to cross over into a range of questions that we try to discourage on the site. The example you gave of a question asking &quot;how widespread&quot; is another example that starts to cross the line. While I would agree that for many questions, there may not be &quot;one best answer&quot;. our ultimate goal is to try to find just that ONE best answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question you cited as an example is fairly new and probably has not been viewed by any of the moderators, myself included. It's very difficult for us to read and evaluate every single question, but we usually manage to get around to them all eventually. For something like this, I would usually ask the original poster to modify the question to make it more appropriate with our guidelines. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately, there is a specific standard that has been established for all SE sites, and we ask that everyone adhere to that standard. It is certainly your privilege to disagree with the guidelines, but if it truly bothers you, it is also your privilege to move along. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does this mean that the site is dedicated only to the discussion of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; certain singular and peculiar historical factoids?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Please keep in mind that SE is NOT a forum where people are welcome to come and share in **discussions**. It is a Q&amp;A site, and that is all we expect to see. When people start abusing the comments to carry on a discussion or debate, we will close that question to further comments or simply delete all the comments. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, if you will excuse me, I have to go and attend to 16 flags that have been posted, most of them by you. In a really bad week we normally have about four total, so seeing 16 just over the last couple of days is disturbing. Please do not use the comments or flags as your own form of discussion or debate for any answers or questions. There is a chat session available for History.SE, and it is much more appropriate for that type of activity." />

I think however that the ... presentation ... of those questions has been distracting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was one of the downvoters for the &quot;colonial masters&quot; questions, and I confess that after I hit the downvote and close the question stayed in my mind.  I realized that in fact the question wasn't subjective; that I have read references to scholarly articles that made precisely this claim.  I had a knee jerk reaction to phrases like &quot;colonial masters&quot; that are not infrequently used irresponsibly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not going to agree with @Vector's tone or presentation, nor defend use of flags, etc. I am most explictly not going to argue against @Steven Drennon's response, which I think is correct and useful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do think that there is an issue we should examine.  History is a subtle subject, full of complexity, contradiction and unreliable reporters.  Historians frequently disagree with one another; there are many many historical subjects for which there is no single best answer.  (and the answers change; when I was growing up, Whig History was popular. When I was in college, Marxist development distory was the  One True Faith. Today we have different trends).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE has a different aesthetic/culture/preference.  SE arises from more technical environments where there is more likely to be a single best answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each SE site can and does differentiate from the core principles. **However** I think that if we are to be successful at departing from the core principles, we need to clearly document how, why and what the limits are. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. [Subjective vs Objective][1].  I do not think there is a simple answer to this question. History is going to be more subjective than (for example) security.stackexchange.com.  We need to develop and continuously refine our own definition of good subjective and counterproductive subjective.  I *suspect* that H:SE's interpretation of good subjective includes answers based on phrases like &quot;success of the resulting state is a subjective term, but if we allow GDP to stand in as a measure for success, then....&quot; If you'll permit me to abuse my own example, then I'll quickly point out that such answers lead inevitably to disagreement, and Lists.&#xD;&#xA; 2. [Lists][2].   (I'll move this to that question if it is deemed more productive). History is an ongoing discussion of multiple correct answers.  I *do not* have an answer as to how we can reconcile the practice of history with SE preference for single best answers.  I believe it is worth examining the problem, developing and continuously refining an answer.  &#xD;&#xA; 3. Respect. Respectful language, respectful comments, respectful questions. We need to be very careful to be civil and respectful to one another, and to those affected by the questions.  I now admit that I was unjust to &quot;knee jerk&quot; in response to &quot;colonial masters&quot;, but I'd just read another question that bordered on racial profiling.  **NOTE WITH EMPHASIS**  I recognize that many participants on H:SE are either (a) not native English speakers, and therefore not aware of the subtle implications of some phrases - &quot;poofy pants&quot; comes to mind as an example of a phrase that wasn't intended to offend or amuse, but which has a different meaning in different cultures.  We have to live with that reality (b) some of the participants are new to history and aren't aware of some of the groundwork. I made those same erroneous assumptions when I was just starting to study history. We have to be respectful when we point out that the world is more complicated.  (c) legitimate differences of opinion.  @Samuel Russell &amp; I come from very different assumption sets; it would be very difficult for us to hold a conversation on many historical topics because we don't agree on the fundamentals. (Once he used the term &quot;valorization&quot;, I realized that we simply wouldn't bridge the gap.) I don't think he's wrong, I just think he applies a different set of assumptions and methods to analyze history.  I prefer my assumptions and methodologies.  Fortunately we've been very respectful of one another, and I'd be happy to buy him a beer and discuss any non-economic issue.  I'll upvote his answers in many cases because they are well researched, well thought through, and well written.  Sometimes I'll upvote his, and then add my own answer because although I respect his opinion, I simply come from a different place.  (Aside: that makes it very difficult for H:SE to identify &quot;one best answer&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not going to pretend that I have any of the answers, but I do think that we should ponder @Vector's question.  Personally, I find the tone to be a bit more provocative than I find useful, but if I read past that, I think there is an important question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/q/667/1401" />

Such style of questions are commonly asked on Stack Overflow and no one has any issue (e.g. &quot;here is my code snippet, what am I doing wrong?&quot; questions are fine on SO). There are plenty of proper academia sites if you want to discuss 'proper' history, let us hobbyists and amateurs have some fun too :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That being said, we should make sure that anything to do with ice road truckers or lumberjacks or aliens be swiftly purged lest we turn into a certain TV channel I won't name.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I stay on this site purely as a hobby, if suddenly it becomes against site policy to ask simple 'trivia' questions then I wouldn't have any reason to stay anymore.

I'm going to downvote  because it is an insult to the community.  Questions like this one are very likely to be consider for closure as &quot;I'm not sure what you're asking.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### If you must ask such a question.....&#xD;&#xA;The great tragedy is that these questions are, in my opinion, simple to transform into valuable questions. **Provide your source**.   If you're asking about a historical figure, provide a link to that historical figure.  Not only do you vastly increase the value of the site as a reference source and learning aid, but you may disambiguate the question.  There are many historical figures who are known by different names, and many that share the same name.  If you're wondering about some historical theory, then provide a link to that theory. If you provide me a link to an interesting historical theory that I've never heard of, then I'll upvote your question, praise you publicly and instruct the network of telepathic goldfish to send good vibrations your way.  But more importantly, if you include the relevant details in your question, you increase your chances of getting a good answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Example&#xD;&#xA;[Jesus in India][1]  - My objection is **not** about religion; my object is that the question asks for evidence about a theory that (as far as we know) is only in OP's mind.  &quot;What evidence is there that Jesus visited Schenetady N.Y.? What evidence is there that Mithradates visited London?&quot;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;@Vector did some research and found what plausibly was the [source][2] that OP was thinking of, and I think that @Vector deserves multiple upvotes for rescuing the question and for research an answer.  But since OP chose to ask the question as a guessing game, we don't know if that is the source, or if  the OP received telepathic messages from a nearby goldfish.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Counterexample&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This question][3] (singer and applause) is different; @Voitcus admits that memory is the issue, and even provides some details of the research that he's done. There is even a hypothesis that we're invited (implicitly) to help prove/disprove.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or look at [The Eastern Question][4]; @JFW takes the time to offer definitions of the terms used in the question and the context.

I'm a Community Manager for Stack Exchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the end of the day, a vote represents the opinion of a user, to identify whether a question is **useful** or **not useful** in addition to points about clarity and research and whatnot. Voting is the tool for the community as a whole to judge posts. It is as much to identify when a question is poorly written as it is to identify that the problem being asked about... really isn't worth anyone's time. There are ultimately three states to a vote, though, and there's always the option to simply &quot;not vote&quot; when you think a question is not very helpful in your own analysis but figure that others may find it worthwhile or helpful when pursuing that route. Basically, if a post qualifies as &quot;not interesting enough to upvote&quot;, you're valid to not vote on it instead to express the lack of interest, and a downvote is unnecessary unless you feel it is a negative to the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're not downvoting just to express your opinion. You're downvoting to express your opinion on the validity of a topic to the community. Taking a personal voting grudge on, say, [tag:china] here because you loathe the country and everyone in it, that would be petty. You may still vote as such, as it is your opinion to give, but it's not a very healthy way to go about voting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But if there was a subject matter on which you feel that dealing with questions about them is not useful to *anyone in the community*, then from that you could downvote against questions of that subject matter. This would be because, moreso than your personal hatred for the subject matter, you're voting because you don't believe the question to be valuable to anyone, which is inline with how one should be voting at all times. It shouldn't be &quot;I don't like this&quot;, it should be &quot;This isn't useful to the site&quot;. Typically, subjects that would get identified in this way usually end up being the subject of topicality discussions - if there's a community consensus that a particular subject is toxic to the site, then it makes sense to bar the subject.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not fond of murder and the like either, though I personally stay out of news often just to not dwell on it. So I can understand your dislike of seeing those kinds of questions. However, I don't personally think it's a subject matter that's harmful to the community as a whole to discuss, so I don't feel that downvoting everything is healthy, neither to the community nor to you as a voter. **There is a more applicable course of action for you, though - ignored tags**. In your profile, there's a tab in the top right that says 'prefs', which you may use to identify one or more tags as &quot;ignored tags&quot;. These will be greyed out when they show up or, if you mark the appropriately labelled &quot;hide ignored tags&quot; checkbox on the same page, hidden altogether from your view as you browse. Using this would let you navigate the site entirely without needing to acknowledge this subject matter, while not inhibiting the abilities of other users to partake in their own millings-about with the topic. It would also avoid the otherwise necessary viewing of such questions to begin with that downvoting would require." />

But on this site there will likely be a small minority of professionals and a vast majority of &quot;amateurs&quot;. What will likely happen is that the professionals will dominate all the discussions and the amateurs won't be able to do much but listen and ask questions, as if they were in class. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the question becomes who is the audience for this site and what is its purpose?

Sometimes this invovles &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Examples &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [What color are tracer rounds][1] I'm not sure where you'd look this up, but H:SE provides not only an answer, but details that would help to interpret the source. Note that OP has provided a source, asked a precise question, and implicitly has considered how the question could be answered.&#xD;&#xA; - [How far could an English War Bow Shoot][2] This is the kind of thing that *can* be found in books, but once again, interpretation of the source (credibility, completeness, etc.) is greatly facilitated by a practitioner of the art.  OP has supplied a source (and implicitly has consulted others) and clearly expressed the reservations about the source. Not a perfect question, but IMHO a good fit for H:SE.&#xD;&#xA; - [How long to forge a sword][3] - another question where there are sources, but sources tend to neglect to mention critical details, or assume that the researcher has background skills &amp; knowledge that are not common. OP clearly identifies some of the terms that are making interpretation of the answers difficult (and again, implicitly demonstrates that research has been done.)&#xD;&#xA; - [How were swords worn in the 18th century?][4]  OP specifies the constraints that are confusing, the experiments that have been tried and the resulting confusion. OP also implicitly recognizes that there are those of us who wear swords and can speak to the issue. I suspect there are textual sources, but any costumer will tell you that textual sources require a wealth of experience to interpret.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Implications&#xD;&#xA;This is an example of a pattern that doesn't have a lot of implications, except to feel free to ask H:SE unusual questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ask H:SE questions where it is difficult to interpret the source material without background that is non-trivial to obtain.

Still, I think this question will get deleted quickly, as a predecessor with less details did earlier this week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this site going to do history, or censorship? What's up?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make sure the question text is preserved as I intended it (others might modify the text to remove it's consistency and coherence), I will leave it here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;===== Text of Question =======&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If one examines the evidence for the 9/11 attacks with no prejudice from media stories, they occurred as follows.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A high level official arranged 4 drills&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. live fly drone drills (reported accepted 9/11 drill)&#xD;&#xA;2. fake radar blips on norad and air-traffic computers (reported accepted 9/11 drill)&#xD;&#xA;3. fake hijackings on 4 United and American flights (speculative 9/11 drill)&#xD;&#xA;4. flight simulate flying planes into buildings (reported accepted 9/11 drill)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The confirmed drills were part of a set of terrorism preparedness drills active on the morning of 9/11, designed to deal with the event of multiple simultaneous hijacking. The indicated drills were leaked in 2002, Bush called them an &quot;uncanny coincidence&quot;. But there is no coincidence. Using these 4 drills, a few changes in details allow the attack to be carried out by the drill coordinator, using no co-conspirators.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You send up 3 drones for drill 1, fly them close to the airliners, use drill 2 to switch the position of the airliners and the drones. Use drill 3 to have a pretend hijacking with 4 CIA agents in the plane, and one in the cockpit who tells the pilots to land at the nearest air-force base and transfer passengers. And use drill 4 to get professional pilots to pilot the drones into the WTC and Pentagon, all the while they are thinking they are doing a simulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, once all the passengers are transferred to flight 93 (actual plane is flight 11), you shoot down the plane, since there were already 3 attacks, this is not going to be questioned, nor will the need for a cover up. It only takes a glance at the flight 93 crash site to see it did not crash there, and the debris field was scattered over tens of kilometers, as happens with a flight shot down 10 km up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The buildings are rigged for demolition using thermite months before, using a small team of specialists who use the elevator repair events and the special security clearences to set up the building. The owner does not need to know that the attack is staged, only that there is a special system for demolition in case of attack. This is supported by hard evidence, in particular the presence of thermite residues found by Jones using mass-spec in analysis of 9/11 dust. Some of the thermite could still burn, also shown by Jones. This passed review and has been confirmed by others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nobody but the drill coordinator needs to know the plan, not even the president. This is a plan of one person, no conspiracy, not of government officials, not of 19 suicidal hijackers. Just one person's plan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This scenario is consistent with the evidence, in particular the ACARS evidence that flight 175 landed in Cincinnatti later that day (and flight 93 also--- these are probably empty planes), it is consistent with airline data which lists flight 175 and 93 as still active, only flight 11 and 77 are listed as destroyed (Pilots for 9/11 truth). It is consistent with the radar data obtained by freedom of information, which shows the switch of drone and plane for flight 175.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is consistent with the evidence of the engine that landed on Murray st. which is from a military drone, it is consistent with the photos of the bottom of the plane, which shows it is a drone, and it is consistent with the anomalies, because without conspirators, you can't stage a perfect attack.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, it is so consistent, that I just say, it is what happened. I would like to know what historical evidence exists on the other side. I think there is a goose egg zero, nothing. The Osama confession video, even to an untrained eye, is obviously fake--- it just isn't him, and no amount of analysis can persuade a person that this dark big-nosed right-handed beefy guy is skinny left handed long-nosed pale Osama. The ridiculous reports of flight 93 are all coming from unverified stories of unnamed telephone operators, and one absurd phone call to a high government official. There are ridiculous confabulated stories about dead passengers flying out in seats, ridiculous fake eye-witness reports, and so on, which do not point necessarily to a wide conspiracy, but rather to a media circus run by confirmation bias and well meaning sincere attempts to make the case against Osama Bin Laden stronger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am annoyed by a history site which suppresses sincere historical information. A previous version of this was deleted. I am asking if this scenario is what happened, at the moment I am pretty sure the answer is &quot;yup&quot;, except for perhaps a few stupid details I got wrong. I'd like to fix the details using the available documents and testimonies." />

The underlying question is interesting, but I think it is a bad fit for H:SE.  My first thought when reading the question was &quot;This is a question that is more likely to result in debate/discussion/long comment thread; this is not a question that will produce a solid, clear, unambiguous answer that can be used for reference.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My biggest problem with the question was that the terms in the question weren't defined. Any answer based on ill-defined terms is, in effect, a discussion, not an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot;middle class&quot; is a modern term with no definition.  In practice &quot;middle class&quot; is used to mean &quot;earns roughly as much as I do&quot;.  I have acquaintances earning middle six figure incomes who own their own business and claim to be &quot;middle class&quot;.  The term has no meaning and therefore the question is opinion based.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The economic system of Rome in 1CE isn't like the modern economic system; they had a defined &quot;class&quot; system, which is very different from the American &quot;class&quot; system, or the British &quot;class&quot; system.  Was the carpenter a citizen? an equite? a member of the urban tribes?  A resident of Rome?  Urban or rural? Citizen of a client state?  Probably most important of all, did the carpenter in question have a patron, and who was the patron?  A wealthy carpenter at the top of his trade who was the client of a weak patron had a lower status than a middling carpenter with a strong patron.  An unemployed citizen whose father was a carpenter had a higher status than a very wealthy and skilled slave. (I realize that some of these are improbable).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With all the undefined terms, the question is a little like asking whether the taste of green is similar to the scent of the number 3.  Anyone can answer the question, and there is no way to tell which answer is better.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe that it is entirely correct to ask why a question was closed and to use meta to refine our common understanding of what is on and off topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The top-voted answer to http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7907/can-the-new-testament-be-a-valid-historical-record-on-the-real-life-of-jesus boils down to: scholars are divided.  There are enough questions about the validity of religious texts that many people dismiss them as historical sources.  Therefore if you ask about events in the New Testament that are not [found in other sources](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/4214/3252), the only possible answers are opinion-based.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, I happen to disagree with that approach.  For one thing, I find [strong evidence](http://christianity.blogoverflow.com/2012/04/09/easter-as-a-historical-event/) that the early Christian writings were based on eyewitness accounts. For another, it's a double standard.  (We accept all sorts of self-serving and politically-motivated documents as having historical value, so why not religiously-biased texts?)  Every bit of historical evidence should have it's day in court and be judged on it's own merits.  Lumping all religious sources into a single blob is, in my opinion, poor (and perhaps, lazy) history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But my opinion is less important than **our opinion**.  As a group, the consensus is that asking about Jesus is more trouble than it's worth. However, the rephrased question about the economic status of a generic Galilean carpenter, er [builder](http://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/4896/914), under Roman rule can be answered (in theory) without reliance on religious sources.  It's not the choice I would have made, but it seems to be where this site has landed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Different sites have different rules.&#xD;&#xA;-------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can imagine variations on this question being asked on at least four sites:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. History,&#xD;&#xA;2. [Christianity](http://christianity.stackexchange.com/),&#xD;&#xA;3. [Biblical Hermeneutics](http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/), and&#xD;&#xA;4. [Skeptics](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But each site has its own [cultural standards](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/respect-the-community-your-own-and-others/), so the question would need to be asked differently on different sites.  For instance, I [asked](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/11476289#11476289) a regular on Biblical Hermeneutics who told me that the original version would fit there if it included the relevant New Testament references (Matthew 13:55 &amp; Mark 6:3).  It would be harder (but possible, I suspect) to ask on Skeptics and, perhaps, easier to ask on Christianity.  The key is to know your audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, it would help if you'd been more careful with terminology, as [Mark C. Wallace](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/771/690) mentioned." />

Effectively the question is asking &quot;Should I accept the assertions of Authority X or Authority Y about a question where Authority Y is the recognized authority?&quot;  &#xD;&#xA;Google provides answers that are significantly inferior to those on H:SE - the first three don't answer the question and the fifth drops off into fringe speculation.  &#xD;&#xA; 3. [How was Abd al-Rahman I recognized when he arrived in Islamic Spain?][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is an interesting question, clearly phrased.  The question references uncited research, but there is enough information to understand the basis of the question.&#xD;&#xA;Google provides no useful results.&#xD;&#xA;The answer given is ... less than satisfactory. It is probably true, contains a citation, but doesn't contain enough information to understand the answer. Effectively the answer is little more than an assertion. This is a pity because without more information, the answer is of little use to anyone.&#xD;&#xA; 4. [What is “discovery” in the historical sense? How do historians today&#xD;&#xA;    view and describe “discoveries”?][4]&#xD;&#xA;There is a [better answer][5] on H:SE&#xD;&#xA; 5. [Why was the water in roman fountains cold?][6]&#xD;&#xA;The question is clear, but should have been edited (&quot;roman&quot; should be &quot;Roman&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;There are no comprable answers on google.&#xD;&#xA;H:SE provided good answers with references.&#xD;&#xA; 6. [Was the German Empire responsible for the advancement of german&#xD;&#xA;    technology?][7]&#xD;&#xA;I dislike this question. It is full of assertions, assumptions and opinions; it contains no meaningful facts or verifiable sources. What is &quot;German Technology&quot;? How do we measure advancement? &#xD;&#xA;Given my objection to the question, I did not research comprable answers.&#xD;&#xA;The answers on H:SE are .. nonresponsive and unsatisfying.&#xD;&#xA; 7. [What is the earliest known account of the modern military&#xD;&#xA;    salute?][8]&#xD;&#xA;This question is precise, well referenced and clear. The criteria for judging the answer are clear.  This is probably a model for one type of soution to the &quot;example&quot; problem.  Rather than asking for &quot;example of X&quot;, if we ask for &quot;Earliest example of X&quot;, I think it better fits the SE model.&#xD;&#xA;The answers are solid, well researched, and well documented. &#xD;&#xA; 8. [Was it common practice in Victorian London or other Western European&#xD;&#xA;    cities to name locations as places where fictional characters lived&#xD;&#xA;    and acted?][9]&#xD;&#xA;I don't like this question. I think it is too broad &quot;Victorian London or other Western European cities&quot;, and &quot;common practice&quot; make it impossible for me to evaluate answers. I think the question deserves more attention under the rubric of &quot;list questions&quot;.&#xD;&#xA; 9. [Were any drugs (except alcohol) forbidden medevial or ancient times?][10]&#xD;&#xA;This question is too broad and should have been closed - what are the boundaries of &quot;medieval or ancient times&quot;? What is &quot;forbidden&quot;?  I rather wish that I had suggested that the question be rephrased to &quot;What is the earliest example of an anti-drug policy?&quot; or something along those lines.  &#xD;&#xA;Given my misgivings about the question, I cannot evaluate the answer. It is true, but does it really answer the question.&#xD;&#xA; 10. [What factors made Europe conquer almost the whole world?][11]&#xD;&#xA;**CLOSE IT CLOSE IT CLOSE IT, please oh please close it**  I feel rather strongly about this one, but I'm in the minority.  This is almost the canonical example of a question that requires a huge book to answer, and is therefore a very bad fit for H:SE.  The question also gives off a pervasive odor of exceptionalism, which would require another book.  Now that I've vented my spleen, I have to admit that the question gave rise to some decent answers. I will yield to the majority on this. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10116/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10162/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10005/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10042/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/593/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10152/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10130/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/9995/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/9972/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10022/1401&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10123/1401" />

And unless you were exceedingly naive back then, you must've realized how monumental a task this would be... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The study of history has always been fraught with controversy and bias, even among trained scholars. Would you expect anything different on a website open to the general public and (at this point in time) populated by folks for whom it is primarily a hobby? I don't think you would, and I don't think you *did* - from what I can see, you're a pretty savvy observer. So you *knew* what you were getting into...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...But of course, that doesn't make it any less frustrating. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's the kicker: we don't know if this idea will pan out. There's a big blue &quot;[Beta][1]&quot; label in the title *because* we don't know if it'll work. Enthusiasm and hope don't always translate into something good... Sometimes, the problem is too hard, the goals of each individual too much in conflict with one another, and that initial optimism dies along with any hope of making The Internet a better place for finding good information on a topic. If History Stack Exchange falls apart, descending into partisan bickering and irrelevance, then... Well, it'd hardly be the first such community to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**But here's why I think it has a chance:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  I have no time or patience for the childish petulance of some members&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neither do I. And I don't even participate on this site. I signed on to Stack Overflow five years ago *because* I was sick of lazy questions, poorly-researched opinionated answers, and endless bickering... About *computer programming.* The software here allowed for a few things that weren't possible elsewhere, and with them a chance at producing something other than yet another group of misinformed jackasses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Questions can be edited to clearly state a problem without unnecessary cruft.&#xD;&#xA;- Answers are not locked into a fixed chronological order, but can be posted at any time, edited and improved, and elevated based on their *usefulness to others*. &#xD;&#xA;- Threads can be closed *and removed* if they become opinion-heavy train-wrecks. &#xD;&#xA;- Comments are optional, and voting - the means by which useful answers are elevated and misinformed ones are buried - is **strictly anonymous**. &#xD;&#xA;- [Civility is required][2]. If you can't criticize **constructively**, then don't say anything at all; if you're just here to troll for knee-jerk responses or get up on your soapbox, you can go somewhere else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, as useful as these tools are in overcoming some of the worst tendencies of online (or other...) communities, they're no magic pixie dust: folks can and do misuse them or fail to utilize them at all. It's not hard to find lousy questions and useless answers on Stack Overflow or any other SE site, and sometimes that ends up being all a site can produce... Sometimes, these beta experiments [fail][3]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But *this one* hasn't yet, and doesn't need to. Maybe it has for you, and that's your call - if you're done trying to make this place something better, then you're better off walking away now; this should *never* be something you aren't doing out of love for the topic and hope for the creation of a better place for it. But if you do stick around - and for the rest of the folks who *are* sticking around - I have a few suggestions that might make it a bit less of a painful experience for you...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Vote! Vote like the outcome of a Chicago election depends on it.** You think you know what a good question or answer looks like? Then make that known: vote up everything good, *and down-vote everything bad.* What's that? You don't think a lazy, unsourced but nominally-correct answer is worth a down-vote? You're afraid of driving away new members by rating their poorly-asked questions honestly? Then you deserve the crap-fest you get as a result. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. **Write the best damn answers you can.** You can't control what other people do, but when it comes to writing your own answer you have the final say in what it looks like: use  it. Be your own worst critic, and lead by example: if you're concerned about bias and lack of citations elsewhere, make sure your own answers are factual and clearly drawn from reliable sources. Respond to external criticism by going above and beyond to edit in relevant information and present it in a clear writing style. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **Leave concise, factual criticism on misleading answers.** But *don't* get drawn into arguments: say your piece and *walk away*. If someone can refute your critique, they're free to do so, but **make it clear by your actions** that you won't be drawn into pointless debates. By the same token, don't respond to criticisms on your own posts unless you can refute them with facts and without becoming emotional or defensive. [Don't Feed The Trolls:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29) if you observe a particularly inflammatory or nonconstructive comment (on *any* post), **flag it** and move on. Ditto for questions or answers that are clearly, irredeemably inflammatory. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. **Voting is anonymous - keep it that way.** The reputation and scoring systems here are fun, and serve a useful purpose in controlling both the privileges assigned to members and the status of individual posts. That said, *they are not the primary focus of this site.* If you end up fixating on them - or encouraging others to do so - everyone will suffer for this. So leaving comments like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; **-1:** [actual problem goes here]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    or this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; **Downvoting** because... [reasoned critique goes here].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    or even this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; **+1:** [reason why you think a post is valuable goes here]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ...is all counter-productive. Instead of leading with the information you most want to communicate, you're starting right off with a distraction - and an implicit invitation for the reader to engage in some tit-for-tat rather than calmly addressing or refuting your criticisms. Even if *everything else you write* is constructive and well-reasoned, you're subverting this tone right from the start - *stop doing that*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**To summarize all this:** if you're going to participate here, do your best to work with the system, to use the tools given you, and to set an example for others to follow. It's not easy, and there's no guarantee of success, but very little of value in this world comes easily or without effort; if you think this is important, then work to make it happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In closing, I'd like to thank you for raising this topic here. Even if you did so in an unnecessarily dramatic fashion, the fact that you decided to take a matter that's been troubling you before the community here rather than passive-aggressively working it into your communication on the site itself speaks to a level of respect for others that, IMHO, would be nice to see more of. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheers,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/help/whats-beta&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/help/behavior&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/1062/answers-onstartups-will-close-on-november-12-2013" />

Looking over this quarter's evaluation, I'd say that things are going rather well on History.SE.  I appreciate [Mark C. Wallace's analysis](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/798/690) of the sample questions and all the input on the [July sample](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/636/lets-get-critical-jul-2013-site-self-evaluation).  They were very helpful in my evaluation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quality, overall, looks good.  Yes, there are some below par questions mixed in, but I see a number of real [pearls](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/) too.  I love seeing well researched answers that cannot easily be found anywhere else.  Sure there could be improvement, but I'm not much concerned on that front.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Traffic](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history) has improved quite a bit since the last evaluation and it's solidly in the green.  A good deal arrives at the site via search engines (Google, mostly), which is an important sign of success.  You all should be proud of your progress toward making the internet a better place to learn about history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I see it, this site is on a good trajectory, but there are still things that can be improved given time and some effort.  The easy thing to articulate is that there seem to be about a dozen folks who participate regularly and a 100 or so who participate occasionally.  I suspect that the community would be stronger with more folks providing input on the shape of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Harder to address is my concern that the core of this community are not on the same page when it comes to future direction.  Particularly difficult is how much leeway to give askers of controversial questions (religion, politics, verging on bigotry, and potential conspiracy theories).  For better or worse, History is on the Stack Exchange site circuit for people who ask such questions.     The temptation is to tighten the rules so that you don't have to deal with the fallout of such question.  But there's a lot to be said for Mark C. Wallace's [suggestion](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/801/690) of demanding answerable, civil, and researched questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In sum, you all have built a site full of potential that is already helping thousands of visitors a day learn a thing or two about history.  A primary goal should be to invite more people to participate either through personal and professional contacts or by drawing in casual users.  I look forward to seeing this site grow in the months ahead." />

Flagging an answer is not the first option, but I think it is an option in some cases.  If I saw an answer that said &quot;Thomas Jefferson was a major proponent of a strong, commercially sophisticated, centralized, industrial America&quot;, I'd flag it as of very low quality and counterfactual.  I'd also provide references.   Such an answer would be materially damaging to the site, and I believe that the flag resolution system would be able to resolve the conflict. The answer cited by OP to this question, which related only to the role of Jainism in the upbringing of Mahatma Ghandi, does not deserve a flag; the dispute is a matter of interpretation and emphasis.  In short, I agree that flags are not the best way to resolve disputes, but I think they have a role in resolving outright falsehoods." />

If SE is intended to serve as a reference source, if we want SE Q&amp;A to float to the top of search engines, and if we want the periodic self assessments to indicate that SE Q&amp;A are better research sources than comparative sources, then we need to edit those questions, sometimes extensively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;@Pietr Geerkins is correct to be concerned about invalidating answers submitted in good faith; if we were a simple Q&amp;A site, I would agree wholeheartedly.  But if we are to serve as a reference source, then we need to edit questions to remove extraneous matter.  Assertions like (loose paraphrase) *Western printing is better than Eastern because we know the name of the inventor* diminish the value of the question.  Poor English grammar and spelling will diminish the ability of search engines to find, index, and correllate questions.

This is not a strawman question for argument, it is a serious question about how do we reconcile the goal of being a premier research site with the desire to avoid invalidating good faith answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/11017/1401" />

If SE is intended to serve as a reference source, if we want SE Q&amp;A to float to the top of search engines, and if we want the periodic self assessments to indicate that SE Q&amp;A are better research sources than comparative sources, then we need to edit those questions, sometimes extensively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;@Pietr Geerkens is correct to be concerned about invalidating answers submitted in good faith; if we were a simple Q&amp;A site, I would agree wholeheartedly.  But if we are to serve as a reference source, then we need to edit questions to remove extraneous matter.  Assertions like (loose paraphrase) *Western printing is better than Eastern because we know the name of the inventor* diminish the value of the question.  Poor English grammar and spelling will diminish the ability of search engines to find, index, and correllate questions.

This is not a strawman question for argument, it is a serious question about how do we reconcile the goal of being a premier research site with the desire to avoid invalidating good faith answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/q/11017/1401" />

[Sculpture and shield][1] is a good example. Researcher recognized the iconography of saints, posted links to wikipedia.

Wikipedia is not a venial sin, it is merely the first/next stop on the journey that you're pursuing through history. Sometimes Wikipedia is enough to foreclose a red herring, sometimes it provides a whole new cluster of terms &amp; connections to research. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;H:SE needs to find the right sweet spot - and in my opinion, that sweet spot is that H:SE provides skilled interpretation.  SE excels at providing the context to permit OP's to leverage existing resources.  H:SE is a little different because we don't have practical problems, but H:SE does provide context &amp; interpretation to permit people to pursue research that they find interesting.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/a/11094/1401" />

Polish people are as likely as anyone else to be intelligent or not.  I hope that addresses your specific concern.

For many topics, that's a fair reading: if I can identify the reasoning for concluding that pi is irrational, it's rational for me to believe that mathematical fact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But historical reasoning is often different.  Knowing _why_ Lieutenant Henry S. Farley fired upon [Fort Sumter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumter) does not make that action rational.  History abounds with bad reasoning resulting in monumentally bad ideas.  Asking where such ideas originated does not validate them as ideas.  A considerable portion of the study of history, in fact, boils down to the question: &quot;What were they thinking?!?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, we _have_ seen questions that assume or imply racism on.  Fact is, bigotry of all types exists.  The best place to dispute racist assumptions is in an answer.  Next best is a sympathetic edit.  (Sympathetic is key here.  Sometimes people don't know or understand what the problem is.  An edit that allows a question to be asked without offending folks can help an asker save face.)  Third best is raising the question here, in meta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I appreciate your thoughtful update to the question.  The first version was perhaps too abrupt and sparse to be productive.  It was helpful for you to provide your analysis of the problem." />

The question doesn’t demonstrate any research. Neither answer really addresses the core question; both are supported with some research. I must mark this one “needs improvement”. &#xD;&#xA;3. [When the term “president” was used the first time?][president]&#xD;&#xA;Clearly the OP did not do preliminary research; wikipedia offers an answer.  That answer is however, wrong, as the SE answer predates the wikipedia answer by several centuries. Bad question, good answer.  SE gets marked superior.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. [Did the civil wars of 17th century England facilitate an independent spirit in the American colonies?][Independence]&#xD;&#xA;I believe this is a bad question - it reads like an essay question on a middle grade history exam. It is intrinsically opinion based.  There is no evidence of preliminary research, although I must admit that OP must have done some reading in order to conclude that “it seems like England was endless dealing with battles…”.  &#xD;&#xA;The entire first page of google is filled with references to SE; there doesn’t seem to be a useful answer in the first two pages of google.  One of the reasons that I suspect this of being a homework question is that this mirrors the kind of oversimplification that was presented to me in middle school; there is undoubtedly truth in the thesis, but demonstrating that thesis requires scholarship and a page count far above SE expectations.  I’m going to reluctantly mark SE superior to the internet on this, entirely due to the efforts of Tom Au to portray complex trends in a few paragraphs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. [What is the significance of roof charms outside of the Forbidden City?][charms]&#xD;&#xA;Excellent question, because it is somewhat difficult to research without background.  Google reveals a whole bunch of answers that mention the roof charms, but do not explain them. SE answer disclaims strong authority, but provides an introduction. I would have preferred a little more depth.  I’m going to mark this satisfactory. &#xD;&#xA;5. [How did the Dutch East India Company (VOC) have so much revenue when they only control small part of Indonesia?][VOC]&#xD;&#xA;I’m of two minds about this one; I’m in the middle of listening to “A splendid exchange” by Bernstein. Bernstein provides a clear explanation that would answer the question which is far superior to either of the answers presented. OP asks why VOC was able to make a higher profit than the locals; the simple answer is that the VOC had more capital, and had access to markets where the goods were exponentially more valuable. &#xD;&#xA;OP asks the question based on reading wikipedia; I infer that OP lacks some of the context/scholarship to understand international trade flows in a partially connected world. Revenue is not proportional to the fraction of Indonesia that the company controls, it is proportional to access to markets and to capital. &#xD;&#xA;Comparing the SE answers to google, SE is superior, but only because google is utterly inadequate.  The first page of results contains essential the source that OP cites (and if it were sufficient, OP wouldn’t have needed to ask the question) and a bunch of irrelevant material. &#xD;&#xA;I’m going to have to reluctantly mark this as satisfactory; I want to mark the question “Needs Improvement” because it does, but I have to admit that the answers are superior to google.&#xD;&#xA;5. [Oldest appearance of “brand names” in history?][brand]&#xD;&#xA;I don’t like the question; the terms are ill defined. Google provides clear answers for first brand and first trademark, but OP seems to be using the term idiosyncratically.  The fact that I don’t like the question isn’t really relevant; OP managed to communicate the idiosyncratic use successfully and SE provided an acceptable answer.  This is a distinctive value of SE because google is useless to answer a question where the answer depends on interpretation of an idiosyncratic interpretation.  I’ll reluctantly mark this superior.&#xD;&#xA;6. [Population disparities between New York City and Boston] [population]&#xD;&#xA;This is a flawed question; OP assumes that the importance of a city has something to do with relative population growth. OP provides no research to support that assumption. I also don't like questions where the title is not a question, but that's just unfair of me.&#xD;&#xA;Google is not terribly useful; if I were compelled, google does provide tools to restrict searches in time, and I could assemble an answer based on those tools, but it would be time consuming and error prone. &#xD;&#xA;SE is clearly superior; Pietr Geerkens deserves the plaudits if only for the phrase “the least biased … I could find”.  Because the question is flawed, Mr. Geerkens doesn’t answer it as much as recontextualize the problem. This may be another SE distinctive value.  Again I’m going to reluctantly mark this one as superior, because SE has provided value that the internet can’t.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. [To what extent did the CPC avoid fighting with the Japanese?][CPC]&#xD;&#xA;I hate questions which include acronyms I have to research before I can understand the question. I ignored this question because I didn’t want to research “what is the CPC” and “What era in history” before I could get into the troublesome problem of inferring the motivation of the parties involved.  Wikipedia says that the CPC did fight a guerilla war against the Japanese. Wikipedia on the Dixie Missions explains why the CPC didn’t fight the Japanese.  That said, OP did cover that research in his question, so I have to shut up and eat crow. I can’t or won’t complain about a question that does preliminary research. &#xD;&#xA;SE provides no useful answer to the question. the single answer is downvoted; I’m not expert enough in the subject area to judge why.&#xD;&#xA;I’ll have to mark this “needs improvement”.&#xD;&#xA;8. [What factors led to the 30% devaluation of pound sterling in 1949?][sterling]&#xD;&#xA;I’m going to recuse myself from comment on this, since I provided an answer. I will admit that I’m voting this “needs improvement” because there are more parts of the story that are not in the SE answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what's my conclusion?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; + I didn't complain about civility once. That makes me happy. Some of the Q&amp;A were worded strongly, but none of them made my skin crawl. This is a very good thing and makes me happy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; + SE is superior when the questions are bad.  I want all questions to be perfect, but as someone pointed out in meta, perfect questions are very hard.  When the OP lacks context or has erroneous assumptions, SE provides value that other resources can't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; + Despite my whingeing about the questions, I think they're better than the last crop we evaluated.  Last time I ranted about questions that should have been closed with extreme predjudice. This time there are a couple of questions that I don't like, but only in the &quot;horses for courses&quot; sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; + The only two questions that I rated &quot;needs improvement&quot; probably rely on fairly specialized disciplines of history (fashion history and economic history). I think I can live with that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[racism]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10903/1401&#xD;&#xA;[ruffs]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10810/1401&#xD;&#xA;[fashion]:http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-16th-Century/Ruffs.html&#xD;&#xA;[president]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10969/1401&#xD;&#xA;[independence]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10961/1401&#xD;&#xA;[charms]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10835/1401&#xD;&#xA;[VOC]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10793/1401&#xD;&#xA;[brand]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/11000/1401v&#xD;&#xA;[population]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10898/1401&#xD;&#xA;[CPC]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10913/1401&#xD;&#xA;[sterling]:http://history.stackexchange.com/q/11010/1401&#xD;&#xA;" />

Ross&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Fidelity to fair play informs a Norwegian national passion for OL, the Olympic Games, that embraces popular engagement, organizational skill and athletic prowess. Yet dominance in ice-and-snow sport has siphoned attention from Norway’s initial Olympic engagements that, up to 1924, were summer-only. These reflected an uneasy push-pull dynamic shaped by internal politics, socio-cultural traditions and regional tensions. The nascent Olympic stage gave Norway, which split acrimoniously from Sweden in 1905, needed visibility in an age of ascendant nationalism. However, the elitist early-modern Olympic world also clashed with egalitarian impulses and indigenous traditions that revered idræt, the vigorous but non-competitive pursuit of athletic endeavor. A wider values conflict was telescoped into the Norwegian debate during formative decades, while tensions with Sweden formed a little-known political backdrop to the 1912 Stockholm games. Only from the 1930s could Norway make peace with the Olympic project and forge its Hegelian-like postwar synthesis in which sporting professionalism has eclipsed yet not eradicated traditional idræt  elements. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This indicates that sports history is like any topically focused area of historiography.

Even so, questions do seem to get good traction on Google (~87% of traffic comes from search engines) and the quality of answers is generally higher other resources on the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Long Version&#xD;&#xA;------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two ways to look at the data.  Either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The number of users and traffic drive question rates, or&#xD;&#xA;2. The number of questions per day drives traffic and user participation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first is the most obvious mechanism since you can't have questions without people to ask them.  So let's jump straight to the second:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose you are a brand new user to History.SE.  Maybe you came from another Stack Exchange site or maybe you found an answer to a question here when using a search engine.  If the site looks good to you on first contact, you might start looking around.  The obvious first place to start is the [active questions page](http://history.stackexchange.com/) (which is where you go when you click &quot;Histort beta&quot; on the upper left of the page). Hopefully there are some interesting questions to read (such as http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10933/has-there-ever-been-a-truly-multi-sided-war, which was recently highlighted by the [Stack Exchange Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/stackexchange)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ideally, a new user will find a few questions that are interesting and maybe be inspired to ask or answer one themselves.  But it's probably more realistic to assume they will be distracted by a cat video someone posted somewhere else.  If they ever come back, it would be helpful to see some fresh content.  New answers on old questions can be helpful there, but the best thing would be a fresh question that the new user is interested in and might answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can make a very similar argument for traffic with the big difference that it's Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. who come back to visit the site.  Search engines like fresh content since it's a sign the information is being curated.  New pages (which is what a question represents to the rest of the internet) opens up new search keywords that help people discover the site.  So the rate that new questions are asked correlates with the rate that search engines drive traffic our way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore the very best thing you can do for this site is to find an expert in history who needs an outlet for their writing.  But the _next best_ thing you can do is **ask a great question** every now and then.  In many areas of life the [Field of Dreams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams#Plot) approach just won't work.  People won't miraculously show up at your cornfield just because you built a ballpark there.  But it can work on Stack Exchange.

Our current gut instinct (based on [existing sites](http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday)) is closer to 10 per day.  [Skeptics](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/), which has the most restictions on participation, gets by with about 4 a day.

Personally, I'm a software dev and I got into this site specifically because there's a subsite that deals with my specialty (SharePoint, if you care). Anyway... most people who work in software development have a BS in their field, which required them to take lots of science courses, so one can understand why the sciences are so popular. Additionally, there is a lot of bleedover between software development and fields like mathematics (graphics-based stuff like games in particular can get really, really mathy) and physics, and a lot of scientists have to dabble in programming in order to create the tools they need to run experiments effectively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there is the relative popularity of forums like rpg.stackexchange and the science fiction section. Not to get too stereotypical but hey, I'm kind of a nerd myself and I am definitely into at least one and at times two of those things. It's not that surprising, I don't think, to see that a site devoted primarily to software development and IT related issues is going to also have a lot of people into RPGs and the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;History, though, is on down the list. This isn't to say that nobody's interested in history, but the cohort that comes to SE to figure out how to add a stack panel on a SharePoint site isn't necessarily going to be heavily into history. I mean, I am, because everyone's different (and in fairness my background is about as weird for a programmer as it gets, I think), but I certainly don't think you can *expect* the same level of enthusiasm for this area." />

However, there have been some very well written, and well reasoned reference request type questions that have been closed and deleted (such as the one that prompted this meta post) that I have abstained from voting to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, they are reference requests and that is out of the scope of this SE. However, when the question is well written and well reasoned I feel that it could be in scope, and is a valid and useful question for someone to ask. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that reference requests could possibly be effectively policed using the existing &quot;low quality&quot;, &quot;opinion based&quot; and &quot;Off-Topic&quot; close reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two examples posted by @Leon Conrad illustrate this nicely. The first [question][1] was closed as it is obviously off topic as currently phrased (as explained in comments by Mark C. Wallace). The question is flawed in a couple of ways. It's of limited use to other people, it's too broad (as there isn't a single book that would answer the question) and it's poorly formatted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other side, the question regarding [historical maps][2] is a question for which answers will be valid of a wider range of people. As stated in a comment on that question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; While technically off topic, the answers to this question provide a valuable resource that is not readily available elsewhere on the web, accomplishing an explicitly defined goal of the site: to improve that corner of the web dealing with matters of historical interest. I suggest leaving it open, but converting all the answers to community wiki.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Pieter Geerkens&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this in mind, we could allow reference request questions that are of a high quality (as all our questions would ideally be), provide a valuable resource and are well defined and well targeted (E.g. Books that briefly explain the background to communism in Russia = poorly targeted, broad subject / Online sources for medieval maps = well targeted, well defined subject matter) and use existing close criteria to manage them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7577/how-far-should-i-go-back-in-russian-history-in-order-to-understand-communist-rus&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1633/good-online-sources-for-historical-maps" />

Moderating comments properly is really a deceptively involved and time-consuming process, and one in which all the SE tools and constraints of Real Life are encouraging moderators to take shortcuts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't believe I did anything on that question personally. But I know that when I log in and decide to take care of flags, and see a flagged comment, the temptation is to just delete the danged thing right there and move on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, its better to go read the comment in context (which means reading the question, the post the comment is attached to, and all the other comments). The next temptation is to just delete the thing there, and go on my merry way. However, if you do that often the ensuing comments become senseless. Also, sometimes (particularly if the problem is that post changes have made it obsolete), there's prior comments, or even portions of prior comments, that need to be removed as well. Occasionally it gets so complex that I don't think straightening it out is worth *anyone's* time, and I'll just &quot;declare comment bankruptcy&quot; and purge them all. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Analyzing all this properly frankly a lot of the time ends up requiring a greater time investment that I really have available when I was just popping in to see if there was any quick maintenance needed. Again, that adds to the temptation to just delete the flagged comment and move on. Personally, I try to leave thorny flags for later (or someone else with more time) if I don't have enough time to properly analyze them, but I can easily see where someone else (or even me on a bad day) might occasionally end up cutting corners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then there's always the possibility that the user who posted the comment deletes it. In fact, if the reason for the comment gets addressed (or you just think better of saying such a thing), that's highly encouraged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a user (aka: victim), I think the takeaway should be that comments, unlike proper posts, are not meant to have any permanence. They are writing in the sand. They could stay up for years, or they could be purged tomorrow. If you have something important to say on the subject at hand, you probably ought to try to make a proper post out of it." />

It was reasonably unclear in its intention and as originally worded the second paragraph seemed to be asking for speculation rather than fact. Which is why I personally voted to close.

The voting system we have in place will highlight the bad answers as bad answers for all to see and understand. The truly terrible answers will be flagged and deleted where appropriate and we might, if we are lucky, get a good answer for the question from someone who does know of an answer.&#xD;&#xA;" />

An answer to a question should be evaluated and judged based on the answer.  If I ask &quot;What are good references for X&quot; and someone replies that &quot;Sujarkama's Economics&quot; is a good source, then everyone should be able to evaluate whether that answer is good or bad.

Any activity that could not be done with only one account is fraudulent (e.g., socks support you on meta, casting multiple close votes, awarding bounties between accounts, etc.). When sock puppets &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; engage in these malicious activities, they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; broken the rules and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be prosecuted (i.e. suspension, merging, deletion, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also important to note, the mods have &lt;em&gt;powaz&lt;/em&gt; (shiny tools from the dev team) to locate and stop fraudulent activity of sock puppets. Judging by the info we have, I doubt they are actually sock puppets. For all we know, they could be relatives interested in similar areas of history who have invited others to SE. That's &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;! Always assume the best of users. When the mods do find fraudulent activity (whether by socks or non-socks), be assured they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; deal with it fittingly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/65604/192187&quot;&gt;I am a sockpuppet, may I exist if I have a real purpose?&lt;/a&gt; for more information on socks and their limits. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

Just recently I came across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/182266/how-much-research-effort-is-expected-of-stack-overflow-users/182380#182380&quot;&gt;GREAT Answer&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow, by someone called &quot;user 414076&quot;. I am going to quote it here (remember, the question was, How much research is expected [of Stackoverflow users]): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A lot. An absurd amount. More than you think you are capable of. In fact, asking a question on Stack Overflow is the absolute last thing you ever want to do. You want to avoid it at all costs. You want to think of it as a horrible shame* that will forever haunt you and pass down from you to your descendants. You want very much to find your&#xA;  answer some other way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You want to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Search. Like mad.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Test your code.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Read blogs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Find books.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Follow tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Anything to avoid adding another question to Stack Overflow.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You never want to hit that &quot;ask question&quot; button and absolutely &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; do you want to click the &quot;post your question&quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After you have reached the end of your rope and the pain of not having the answer exceeds the vast amount of shame received by posting your question, that's when you can go ahead and ask. Because at that point, you will have done whatever research necessary to make it a good question worth asking. Because so help me, if your question gets an answer within 30 seconds that has 10 upvotes within 3 minutes, &lt;strong&gt;you did not do enough research&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* The terms &quot;shame&quot; and &quot;never&quot; are a tad bit hyperbolic, but the important point remains that we absolutely want you to do your homework. Understand that our time is not free, though we do not charge for it. Answering low quality, poorly researched, or duplicated questions becomes tiresome.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would need a few minor adjustments to adapt to History Stack Exchange, but the point is clear enough, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, admittedly, for some reason it is harder to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; a well-researched question than it is to give a well-researched &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt;. I found this out when comparing my two thoroughly researched Answers (on Roman slavery and Charles the Bold's nickname) with my lackadaisical American Mafia Question, which could have used a good deal more research. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, for my next question I am presently knee-deep in research. I want to make sure that I've tried all the obvious things first before coming here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then again, maybe a majority of you don't care at all for what concerns me. Maybe you're happy to ask a constant streams of questions about something that could easily have been found on Wikipedia, receive upvotes, get a from-Wikipedia answer, give upvotes, and tomorrow you switch places. A parlor game. Like Trivial Pursuit, but win-win instead of zero-sum since everyone's rep keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that case, sorry for wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

Yes, there are some below par questions mixed in, but I see a number of real &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/&quot;&gt;pearls&lt;/a&gt; too.

A good deal arrives at the site via search engines (Google, mostly), which is an important sign of success.  You all should be proud of your progress toward making the internet a better place to learn about history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, this site is on a good trajectory, but there are still things that can be improved given time and some effort.  The easy thing to articulate is that there seem to be about a dozen folks who participate regularly and a 100 or so who participate occasionally.  I suspect that the community would be stronger with more folks providing input on the shape of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harder to address is my concern that the core of this community are not on the same page when it comes to future direction.  Particularly difficult is how much leeway to give askers of controversial questions (religion, politics, verging on bigotry, and potential conspiracy theories).  For better or worse, History is on the Stack Exchange site circuit for people who ask such questions.     The temptation is to tighten the rules so that you don't have to deal with the fallout of such question.  But there's a lot to be said for Mark C. Wallace's &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/801/690&quot;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; of demanding answerable, civil, and researched questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In sum, you all have built a site full of potential that is already helping thousands of visitors a day learn a thing or two about history.  A primary goal should be to invite more people to participate either through personal and professional contacts or by drawing in casual users.  I look forward to seeing this site grow in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

If it's a so-so post or even just wrong, don't go sympathy upvoting to 'welcome' the user. Help him/her out by leaving a constructive comment. Vote for the post, not the user. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sympathy voting has two major problems: it encourages so-so to just wrong posts and it can remove all new user restrictions for that user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When a new user writes a not-so-great post and it's upvoted out of sympathy (rather than because it was a great post), the new user now has a distorted view of what is a quality post and what needs work.

The other common violation is spamming.

Just recently I came across this [GREAT Answer][1] on Meta Stack Overflow, by someone called &quot;user 414076&quot;. I am going to quote it here (remember, the question was, How much research is expected [of Stackoverflow users]): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A lot. An absurd amount. More than you think you are capable of. In fact, asking a question on Stack Overflow is the absolute last thing you ever want to do. You want to avoid it at all costs. You want to think of it as a horrible shame* that will forever haunt you and pass down from you to your descendants. You want very much to find your&#xD;&#xA;answer some other way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You want to&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Search. Like mad.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Test your code.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Troubleshoot.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Read blogs.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Find books.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Follow tutorials.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Anything to avoid adding another question to Stack Overflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You never want to hit that &quot;ask question&quot; button and absolutely **never** do you want to click the &quot;post your question&quot; button.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After you have reached the end of your rope and the pain of not having the answer exceeds the vast amount of shame received by posting your question, that's when you can go ahead and ask. Because at that point, you will have done whatever research necessary to make it a good question worth asking. Because so help me, if your question gets an answer within 30 seconds that has 10 upvotes within 3 minutes, **you did not do enough research**.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;* The terms &quot;shame&quot; and &quot;never&quot; are a tad bit hyperbolic, but the important point remains that we absolutely want you to do your homework. Understand that our time is not free, though we do not charge for it. Answering low quality, poorly researched, or duplicated questions becomes tiresome.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would need a few minor adjustments to adapt to History Stack Exchange, but the point is clear enough, isn't it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, admittedly, for some reason it is harder to *ask* a well-researched question than it is to give a well-researched *answer*. I found this out when comparing my two thoroughly researched Answers (on Roman slavery and Charles the Bold's nickname) with my lackadaisical American Mafia Question, which could have used a good deal more research. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, for my next question I am presently knee-deep in research. I want to make sure that I've tried all the obvious things first before coming here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then again, maybe a majority of you don't care at all for what concerns me. Maybe you're happy to ask a constant streams of questions about something that could easily have been found on Wikipedia, receive upvotes, get a from-Wikipedia answer, give upvotes, and tomorrow you switch places.

Ideally ihtkwot would also consider re-posting his answer, and then we would delete the History version.&#xD;&#xA;- If you think there are _a lot_ of closed questions on History that should be migrated to Politics, then [you should make a list][3]. When you're done, you could invite the Politics crowd to check out the list, decide which questions we want, and ask Stack Exchange to migrate them manually. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151890/disable-migration-for-questions-older-than-60-days&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/a/1826/739&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/152597/how-to-migrate-old-questions-to-a-new-graduated-site" />

Looking over this quarter's evaluation, I'd say that things are going rather well on History.SE.  I appreciate [Mark C. Wallace's analysis](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/798/690) of the sample questions and all the input on the [July sample](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/636/lets-get-critical-jul-2013-site-self-evaluation).  They were very helpful in my evaluation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quality, overall, looks good.  Yes, there are some below par questions mixed in, but I see a number of real [pearls](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/) too.  I love seeing well researched answers that cannot easily be found anywhere else.  Sure there could be improvement, but I'm not much concerned on that front.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Traffic](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history) has improved quite a bit since the last evaluation and it's solidly in the green.  A good deal arrives at the site via search engines (Google, mostly), which is an important sign of success.  You all should be proud of your progress toward making the internet a better place to learn about history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I see it, this site is on a good trajectory, but there are still things that can be improved given time and some effort.  The easy thing to articulate is that there seem to be about a dozen folks who participate regularly and a 100 or so who participate occasionally.  I suspect that the community would be stronger with more folks providing input on the shape of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Harder to address is my concern that the core of this community are not on the same page when it comes to future direction.  Particularly difficult is how much leeway to give askers of controversial questions (religion, politics, verging on bigotry, and potential conspiracy theories).  For better or worse, History is on the Stack Exchange site circuit for people who ask such questions.     The temptation is to tighten the rules so that you don't have to deal with the fallout of such question.  But there's a lot to be said for Mark C. Wallace's [suggestion](http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/801/690) of demanding answerable, civil, and researched questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In sum, you all have built a site full of potential that is already helping thousands of visitors a day learn a thing or two about history.  A primary goal should be to invite more people to participate either through personal and professional contacts or by drawing in casual users.  I look forward to seeing this site grow in the months ahead." />

It ranks 16 for rude and offensive comments.  That's far more smoke than one would expect from the size of this site.

I haven't been entirely comfortable with the conflict in the comment stream, but I haven't been sure how to address the underlying issues. Your question in meta helped me to clarify those issues and my vision for what I want SE to be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Are sources required?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think your summary is absolutely spot on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It is about the philosophy of the site, whether we are going to make it clear that sources are not required. . . &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You assert, &quot;. . . information page for this Stack Exchange site says that sources are not required . .  &quot;. I'm not sure which information page you are looking at; with my tongue in my cheek, I'll point out that it would have been easier to respond to that if you had provided a source.  My best guess is that you're referencing &quot;[Links to external resources are encouraged. . . &quot;][1]. That is somewhat less conclusive than the way you phrase the admonition, and it appears to be a stock/default phrase on the corresponding page of many help centers.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think sources are required; I'd be a hypocrite if I believed that, since several of my answers are unsourced.  I think sources improve almost any answer. I think sources are vital, possibly even critical when addressing contentious topics.  Sources and methods are and essential distinction between history.stackexchange.com and politics.stackexchange.com, or discussion.stackexchange.com.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the things that makes history history - is that when we hit a disagreement, we analyze sources to see how strongly they support our arguments. If we don't reference sources, then my opinion is just as good as yours, and we're merely discussing things.  I'm not interested in trading opinions. I think there is ample evidence in the help center that H:SE is intended to be a Q&amp;A site, not a discussion site. There is no way to assess the quality of an opinion.  There are common methods to assess the quality of research and analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the core, I think this disagreement originates in the first comment that I saw from you - you said something along the lines that one must deploy logic first, and then seek out evidence; I replied that I thought the obligation was to employ research first, and then test the research against logic. That fundamental disagreement is echoed in your comment to &#xD;&#xA;@litlnemo above &quot;What people need to do is THINK...&quot;  I think there are contexts in which your approach is appropriate.  I am afraid that I don't think that it is appropriate for H:SE.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You cite Soviet history books as an example of invalid answers - I completely agree with you.  That is precisely why I want to know the sources that inform your answers; I need to be able to critically examine them.  @Anixx has cited Soviet documents to support his answers.  I believe @Anixx has a first rate mind and is a better researcher than I am, but **when he cites Soviet sources** he applies a different critical frame than I do. I apply a different standard of scrutiny to answers that cite Soviet sources than I do when he cites other sources. The fact that he cites his sources enables me to evaluate the answer.  You don't give me that opportunity - because you don't cite any sources and are hostile to the notion, I have to evaluate all of your answers against a very skeptical standard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've read enough of your answers to know that they are thorough.  The problem is that without sources, I can't tell whether they are trustworthy, accurate or reliable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Self appointed police&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Guilty as charged.  As the SE about page states, &quot;[It's built and run by you . . .][2]&quot;  We collectively curate this site.  We vote up and down, we comment, we review.  We discuss our shared vision of what the site should be.  I believe that answers with sources are better. I believe that when an answer touches on contentious topics, sources are essential.  When claims are astonishing, sources are essential. If we collectively decide that sources are not required, then I'll back off.  (I think the current guidance is probably good, although if someone were to suggest some language that we could insert specifically on the H:SE page, that encouraged sources, I'd support that)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is the crucial point - if the community tells me to shut up and stop demanding sources, I will.  The community has taken me to task in the past, and I have changed my behavior.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/tour" />

I'll be content with that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a second issue where I think there is less ground for compromise. Your second paragraph accuses me of a witchhunt, and borders on ad hominem.  That is not my intent.  I admit that I would have liked to find a more civil way to respond to some of your comments.  Your comments to Mr. Geerkens, cross the line into ad hominem.  @American Luke cited the admonition that we must always be respectful.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Comments like,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The term &quot;PTSD&quot; has no definite meaning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is an insult to every veteran who is struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.

I can't find anything on the about page that says whether sources are required. The page does say that questions &quot;asking for references&quot; are discouraged because of a tendency to lead to discussion rather than concrete answers. I do not interpret that as &quot;we should not ask answerers to provide sources.&quot; I interpret it as &quot;don't post questions like 'what's a good book about WWII'&quot; or something like that -- it's likely to lead to a lot of opinion and discussion rather than good answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, even then I think it could sometimes be appropriate to ask for reference material here, if the question is narrowly focused and the answer isn't necessarily obvious from basic research. Something like &quot;I'm having difficulty finding sources for the assertion that [something]; I've tried searching [somewhere] but all I find are people saying they heard it from someone else. Does anyone know of a source that is at least secondary if not actually primary?&quot; That seems to be a legitimate question here to me -- it's more concrete and useful." />

The same things could be said for a great many other conspiracies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the idea is that there are common threads amongst closed questions then I have to disagree. I do not think that closed questions on History share many attributes. Usually questions closed on here are closed because it is not clear what they are asking, or questions are closed because they are objectively outside the realm of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think Tyler is on the right track in terms of enthusiasm, but I think that the fact we receive a lot of bad questions, in his estimation, is more due to the general public's lack of interest in formal study/understanding of history. History is often plucked from it's context as a piecemeal solution to arguments. The selective treatment that History receives has more to do with problems surrounding History than any phrasing or constructing of questions that we could capture with a filter." />

Is that true?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, thank you for having done at least some preliminary research.  I appreciate that you've made an effort.  That said, unless you have a reason to doubt the fact in question, why are you asking?  Do you have a reason to believe that there was an eighth Pryce baronet?  Are you confused about how a baronetage (or any other title) go extinct?  Do you doubt the existence of the Pryce baronetage at all?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of those questions are valid.  But if your question is just &quot;I read X, is it true?&quot; &#xD;&#xA;then you're wasting your own time, let alone mine.  There are a huge number of assertions on wikipedia; we could fill up the H:SE question queue with questions about whether any given assertion is true.  H:SE would wind up being a copy of wikipedia.  If your only question is whether an arbitrary assertion on wikipedia is true, then I'm going to downvote your question.  If I'm having a bad day, I'm going to downvote your question, then answer it by citing the wikipedia page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# How to fix the problem&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a reference to a ninth baronet Pryce and you need to reconcile the statement in wikipedia with evidence you have elsewhere then include in the question references to both bits of evidence (the wikipedia page and whatever other evidence you have).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't understand how a baronetage can go extinct, then your question isn't &quot;is that true?&quot;, your real question is &quot;how does a baronetage go extinct?&quot; or &quot;How does inheritance of a baronet work?&quot; (that's actually a rather good question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you doubt the existence of the Pryce baronetage because all English titles are the invention of our reptilian overlords, then I need to know that so I can cast a close vote rather than a downvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't understand what a baronetage is, then I suggest you do a couple of google searches before you answer, and incorporate that research into your answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the assertion in wikipedia sounds implausible to you, then I'd do a bit more research and make it explicit.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Wikipedia says that George W. Bush and Sylvester Stallone are the same person; after all they were born on the same day, and they are both white males, given all that evidence, how can you tell the difference between them? I've done some research and I cannot find any photographs that contains both of them, but the underlying claim sounds a bit suspicious to me.&quot;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The nice thing about phrasing the question that way is that we can answer it if we can find a single photograph showing both of them, or some other irrefutable evidence that they are different people.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions that involve more research are less likely to get downvotes than questions that involve little or no research." />

Spence writes exceptionally well and this book seems very highly regarded. I was surprised to find key questions often overlooked; important background frequently omitted; and an almost complete lack of footnotes, any other discussion of his sources, or discussion of their uncertainties -- we are given only his analysis to take at face value. He says this Third Edition has many edits; perhaps earlier editions were different?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * A History of Chinese Civilization by Jacques Gernet, J. R. Foster, Charles Hartman (translated from French): This seems well-regarded, but I'm not sure if the Amazon reviewers know what they are talking about. Also, less than a third of it covers the period I'm interested in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * China: A History by Harold Tanner: Also seems well-regarded, but again it's hard to tell and it covers all of Chinese history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

On all of the SE sites the rules are ambiguous - just like most&#xD;&#xA;    **LAWS** are ambiguous - it's the nature of the beast. There are always different ways to slice and dice and interpret rules/laws and&#xD;&#xA;    some people will be more &quot;liberal&quot; and others more &quot;conservative&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    about it. Sometimes you do feel bad that a question is closed - you&#xD;&#xA;    can try editing it, restating it in a different way, etc - sometimes&#xD;&#xA;    it works, sometimes not. We do have a user driven community here and&#xD;&#xA;    you won't always see eye to eye with the community at large - again,&#xD;&#xA;    it's the nature of the beast: Some people will inevitably &quot;fall through the cracks&quot; in any system of rules or laws that is community driven and seeks to regulate a large number of people.&#xD;&#xA; 3.

Also note that&#xD;&#xA;    many questions closed because they constitute a &quot;request for&#xD;&#xA;    references&quot; can be re-worded in a more acceptable way. And as @T.E.D.&#xD;&#xA;    has hinted, if you're comfortable enough on the internet to be&#xD;&#xA;    seriously engaged on SE sites, doing google/wikipedia/amazon&#xD;&#xA;    searches etc should be a simple matter and you'll find plenty of&#xD;&#xA;    references. I personally have found that using Amazon together with&#xD;&#xA;    their user reviews is often an excellent resource for reference&#xD;&#xA;    material. Most history books that are not &quot;hard core&quot; scholarly&#xD;&#xA;    works will be found on there with plenty of user reviews for the&#xD;&#xA;    good/popular ones - you can get the good the bad and the ugly from&#xD;&#xA;    there.

A distinguished scholar had called the lack of population transfer to resolve the latter conflict unprecedented.  I asked whether it truly is. That set off a firestorm I had not intended.  But one interesting point was made that leads to a more fascinating issue -- if population transfer is a war crime, then, arguably, the resettlement of refugees to end a conflict, as was done in India/Pakistan, and more recently in the former Yugoslavia, as well as following several African tribal and ethnic wars, would be a war crime, too.  Moreover, the Saudi Arabian proposal for peace in Palestine, as well as the aborted proposal at Camp David at the end of Clinton's administration, which would have forced Jews to leave their home, would also be war crimes.  Is the alternative to keep refugees in camps until they have a home to get back to?  Do we force Suni and Shiite neighbors who have been fighting tooth and nail with each other in Iraq to live together whether they like it or not, and whether their countries borders are redrawn creating a situation where they would be forced to live in a hostile environment.  Would the UN and warring nations be barred from redrawing their maps to say &quot;this side is for people of the X and that side is people of the Y&quot; and de facto establishing incentives for the residents to leave homes they and descendants have lived in all of their lives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then it gets interesting when you ask, &quot;how do we determine who are the people who cannot be forced to move?&quot;  Whose law would be used to determine this?  Squatters rights means one thing in western society and is quite different under Islamic law. And finally, you have the touchy issue of the occupation by a nation of land that did not belong to anyone officially.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Easily, there is a  Ph.d disertation here and certainly a good opinion question.

If a quotation was reported in a publication you think has a bias, that doesn't mean it isn't factual.  A &quot;quote&quot; or &quot;fact&quot; in pro-Arab Al Jazeera may be as true or could be as false as one in the pro-Israeli settler Arutz Sheva radio and internet network.  Either's &quot;facts&quot; could be out of context, too!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me tell you a personal story:  In 1996 I was with my family for my daughter's bat mitzvah in Jerusalem.  During our first days there, there was a lot of Arab publicity about how they were going to build an addition to Al Aqsa Mosque in Solomon's Stables -- which were not neither stables nor Solomon's, but was part of the Herodian Temple complex and should have been excavated by archeologists before any building commenced.  The Waqf -- the Moslem caretakers of the mosque would have nothing to do with archeologists.  Archeologists were demanding something be done, but the government wasn't taking the bait, I though.  They figured that Arafat was looking for a fight, and was looking for an excuse.  Nothing happened that day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the day after Yom Kippur we planned to see the Kotel tunnel tour, which at the time was an archeological dig underneath the housing in the Arab quarter adjacent to the Wall of the Temple Mount (aka the Kotel).  From the Kotel plaza, where people pray at the Wall, the tunnel runs directly north in the direction of the Dome of the Rock, but on the other side of the mamouth walls placed there by Herod and are about six feet wide, I'd guess.  No way did we ever go east of the Western Wall.  Impossible.  Until that day, the tunnel patrons had to exit out the same door they entered, at the plaza.  But that day, for the first time ever, an exit into the Arab quarter had been opened and my tour was the first to go out it.  We were told that the city government wanted us to buy from the Arab merchants in the Old City, and also, the exit would solve traffic jams inside the tunnel.  Fine.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We were also told, that since we were the first, we would be on television, and should not say anything provocative.  We didn't.  Before we left, we saw a well dressed Palestinian Arab in white clothing come down the exit to inspect us. I never saw or heard of that man again, despite all of the events soon to occur.  On our exit, I saw lots of tv cameras, but never saw myself on television (probably because we were too well behaved -- bad television).  I saw lots of police in riot gear, and all of the Arab shops but one were closed in protest of our exit.   As far as I knew, I was no threat to the Arab people or Palestinian statehood.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We walked from the Arab Quarter to the Jaffa gate and went to the post office to buy stamps to mail postcards.  Just then, I saw cars of riot police heading for the Kotel.  I told my wife that there must be trouble.  When we got to our room, CNN showed Yassir Arafat claiming that my tunnel tour had gone underneath the Al Aqsa mosque (to do so we would have had to have gone to the other side of the six-foot Herodian wall and south and east -- we didn't -- also construction was completed seven years before).  That announcement, apparently, started four days of rioting and heavy casualties.  Today, a [Palestinian &quot;fact&quot; site][1] does not attribute the claims of damage to Al Aqsa to Arafat -- although I heard it from his lips when he said it -- and have it has twisted the incident into a claim of an attempt to judaize the Arab quarter -- something that hardly seems worth four days of rioting.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So let me turn the question back to you:  given my personal experience, should I trust &quot;Arab propaganda&quot;?  If you quoted that site to me, should I vote it down?  Not everything it said is a lie.  It might only earn two pinnochio noses on the Washington Post fact checker column. And my gut feeling -- that Arafat was looking for an excuse to have a small riot, may not be the correct context, or then again, it might.  Who knows?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is much that goes on where we only have half of the facts and context.  It is difficult for any of us on the outside to know what is the whole truth.  It is similarly impossible for those closest to the facts to understand the context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If my house has been destroyed by a missile or members of my family killed, I don't want to hear context.  I don't care.  And whether I'm an Arab or Jewish Palestinian, I'm not going to go on television and discuss the politics or the military reasons or even the depths of international law. All I'm going to do is cry, and maybe even want vengence. And if I'm a reporter at the scene, I'm not going to ask the survivors about that, but I will take video images because death destruction and tears of the grieving make good television.  The truth might not come out, really, but leet those who want the truth wait for 100 years the historians from the eventual winner's side to sit down and figure out which truth suits them best.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_kotel_tunnel_1996.php" />

In my experience here, questions that are not specifically historical are closed and deleted reasonably quickly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Equally, questions that show little or no research or are just based on a common assumption or other bit of trivia are usually closed (I fell fowl of this when I first posted here...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, out of the three non-meta questions you've had closed I personally voted to close one and would have voted to close another if it hadn't already been. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your [Patterns for World Wars][1] question is the one I would have voted for.

That said though, there isn't a definitive answer to it and it's always going to be very subjective; that's why I would have voted to close.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next, the [Founding of Rome][2] question. I think is fine, it's a little thin on the ground and is close to being trivia, but I feel that a good, unique answer could have been written for it. Oldcat provided a reasonably good answer but I think that someone who knows a lot on the subject could provide more information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing that might have contributed to it being closed could have been the attitude taken towards outside input into the question. I think the edits made were valid, and didn't change the scope, meaning or intention of the question - just improved it's format and provided more background to the reader. It might have wound people up, telling them that they cannot do something that the creators and moderators of SE allow, and that could have lead to the question being closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, we have &quot;[Have Adolf Hitler ever personally witnessed any of his crimes?][3]&quot;, the question I did vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I voted to close it because it was too general - I realistically shouldn't have selected the option I did; I should have selected &quot;Too Broad&quot;. The number of crimes that Hitler committed is huge, and varies depending on who you are and from what perspective you look at it legally; i.e. International Law, National Law etc. Reducing the scope of the question to limit it to one area or specific type of crime would see me voting to re-open it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As it stands though, it has two good answers, and there is an argument that if it has good answers then the question is of some value to the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The remainder of your questions have a substantial amount of upvotes, in fact many of the closed questions also gained upvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I'm saying is that out of the 3 questions you've made that have been closed 2 of them stand a good chance of being re-opened and answered if they were edited to reflect some of the feedback. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14725/pattern-for-world-wars&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14797/the-founding-of-rome&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14231/have-adolf-hitler-ever-personally-witnessed-any-of-his-crimes" />

We all need to be more civil and respectful to one another. (I admit my hypocrisy. Despite my continued requests for civility, I have fallen short of the goal. I forget who accused me of &quot;withering sarcasm&quot;, but I've taken that to heart.

I think what you have is a question about international law, not a question about history. I'm not sure that historical sources and methods would be able to answer whether X is a crime, let alone reason about what hypothetical answer might be a crime.  It might be possible to ask, &quot;What grounds have been used in the past to determine that specific re settlements violate or conform to international law?&quot;  That way we're not trying to decide a question about international law, we're consulting sources to determine if there is an internationally recognized principle or method to reach a determination. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. This question borders on speculation - &quot;If .. arguably... would be&quot;  Those words all cause my downvote finger to twitch.  The scope suggestions of H:SE discourage speculation and hypotheticals.   I'm not entirely sure how to resolve this - I don't know what the question would look like if the speculation were removed.   It might be that &quot;What are the criteria used to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal or not?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. I think there is an assumption about the nature of crime. If I take your house, that is a crime. If the government takes your house, that is eminent domain and it is entirely legal.  If I force you and your family to resettle, that is a criminal act; if the government forces you to do so, that is a legal act, and any attempt to resist that is illegal.  The situation you describe is a bit more complex because there is no world government (despite the fears of the wingnuts and the ardent desires of the fruitloops).  But if the resettlement is carried out as an attempt by the international community to resolve a dispute, then the action is arguably legal.  Of course I've use the word *arguably* (see prior paragraph) and *legal* (see first paragraph).  Again, I think the H:SE question probably runs something along the lines of &quot;What criteria has the international community historically accepted to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suspect the ultimate answer is the [Mandate of Heaven][1] - the very pragmatic method of &quot;if it results in good rule, then it must have been the right choice; if it results in chaos and disorder, then obviously it was illegal.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not sure that helps, but I thought your question was good enough that it deserved an attempt at an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_heaven" />

Have we decided this before?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe that we've discussed this before, but I didn't find a question that really encapsulated the issue that I believe @lohoris and I were discussing. (At this point let me eat some crow - I may have been party to a discussion on another SE site about requests for references which resulted in a strong consensus that they are out of scope.  I have been working from the belief that we had collectively discussed and decided this. So if I could have the crow stir fried with a bit of curry?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Working with references is not history][1] ( There are some peripheral issues in this question that aren't really relevant.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Are questions asking for reference material on topic][2] - very nice question and answer, but it never really resolves the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# History&#xD;&#xA;@BartArondson asked for a [reference to the history of IKEA][3]. The question as originally phrased explicitly requested references, but in the context of a question about history. Rather than discuss the dilemma in the comments, I asked that the question be moved to this forum, and I've flagged the set of comments as obsolete because I don't believe that they usefully respond to that question - particularly in light of my supper of crow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Further examples&#xD;&#xA;Other questions that relate to this and seem relevant&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Where can I find Nuremburg videos][4] - OP is asking for the location of/access to a single video.

Non-archival primary source collections are books.  These books display selectivity, translation, editorial control of meaning.  They're works, in part, of art.

These are questions where a quantifiable answer exists but it's either zero or many answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance: *&quot;Was there a king that had seven legitimate sons?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's a paradox in so far that instead providing **0** *(no answer - implicit)*, **1** *(no answer - explicit)* or **N** answers *(subset of known or knowable answers)*, the question is closed as too broad or opinion based because it didn't resolve to precisely one answer. When in practice, if a question has multiple valid answers then the question should *have* multiple answers&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;; not none to frustration of the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So. To return to the basic criteria of: ***Does it add value?***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If the question isn't historically coherent and you can't fix it: *Close*&#xD;&#xA; - If question is unanswerable and the OP wants the question addressed as-is&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; *and* this is the first time we've seen this question: *Answer why the question is unanswerable at the current time. Should include the Why so as not to cover for personal ignorance.*&#xD;&#xA; - If the question is unanswerable and we've see it before, more or less as worded: *Close with appropriate duplicate link*&#xD;&#xA; - If the question, if answerable, allows for multiple equally valid answers: *Allow any answer and applicable voting on quality of said answers until the high threshold is met for putting the question on hold / freezing out extra answers.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;1. Courtesy of Stack Exchange's origin as a computing programming Q&amp;A with clear falsifiability.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;2. Unless you didn't close the first instance of an unanswerable question.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;3. Comments don't accrue reputation; can not be cleaned or refined after 5 minutes; and not guaranteed to be persistent in the underlying database.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;4. Rare cases of a super-abundance of answers can be treated the same as other stacks do through use of the On Hold action for curtailing *Me Too!* answers.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;5. Occasionally the OP meant to ask a question that is answerable, but more often the OP really does want some reply to the question as asked. For knowing what we don't know is vital in any branch of human knowledge.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence" />

Validating the flag will increase the flagger's &quot;helpful&quot; counter and delete the comment, without any kind of penalty or notification to the commenter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For most comment flags, no further action is necessary. Assuming the comment is truly egregious, or the commenter has exhibited a repeating pattern of disruptive behaviour, the responding moderator may proceed to warn them via a private e-mail or suspend their account. Moderators are generally encouraged to warn on first offense and only suspend when a behaviour persists, but the decision is completely up to the responding moderator&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the general approach on all Stack Exchange sites. And it's far from foolproof. I've been moderating two sites for some time now, and I can tell you that it's _extremely_ easy to miss a pattern of abusive comments. We do have access to a full history of comments (including deleted ones), but unless we have a good reason to go look at it, we won't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you happen to spot a repeating behaviour that hasn't been handled properly, please consider using the custom flag to clearly explain what's going on. A flag message like: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hey, this guy has been posting abusive comments for a while now, could you please take a closer look?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;is probably all you need to do to help the responding moderator realize that there's something more there than a single abusive comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the more technical stuff, see: [How does comment voting and flagging work?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/17364)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The other moderators _and_ Stack Exchange are automatically notified of all private e-mails and suspensions.

Given that the question has been viewed 12708 time in a little over a month, it shouldn't be too surprising that the top answer has gotten noticed too.

If two people answered with sales statistics for different books, it is then easy to choose a better answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's my justification for asking about book sales.

When I am having trouble figuring out what the&#xD;&#xA;   guy is asking then the question must be bad, or at least its phrasing&#xD;&#xA;   must be bad.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - Unanswerable questions. There are some questions which are&#xD;&#xA;   &quot;answerable&quot; enough that they are not off-topic, but at the end of&#xD;&#xA;   the day are not likely to be answerable, like &quot;What mental illness&#xD;&#xA;   did Claudius have?&quot; How are you going to even answer that? It's a bad&#xD;&#xA;   question that does not really have an answer. I ask myself: lets say&#xD;&#xA;   we evolve and become super-sentient. Will we EVER be able to answer&#xD;&#xA;   this question? If the answer is &quot;probably not&quot;, the question fails&#xD;&#xA;   the test.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - Questions based on incorrect or unproven assumptions or premises. I&#xD;&#xA;   hate these. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe other people have good criteria for voting a question up or down." />

Someone&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; notices the nature of the question, and adds the tag [tag:references].&#xD;&#xA; 2. Someone creates a community wiki answer. &#xD;&#xA; 3. Someone adds a comment to the question giving the questioner the option of either accepting the community wiki answer, or having the question held until they can rephrase it to no longer qualify as a list of references. The comment should reference this meta post for a fuller explanation to the original poster.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Users who wish to answer at this point may do so (with normal non-wiki answers). &#xD;&#xA; 5. Any references listed in a new answer will also be added to the accepted wiki answer by someone (preferably the person who posted the answer), with no commentary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1 -&quot;Someone&quot;, in true StackExchange fashion, means any user who happens to notice that it needs doing and has the requisite reputation to perform this action. Users who notice and *don't* have the needed reputation may flag the item to request it get done.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;Advantages of this approach: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The compilation wiki answer puts the complete list of mentioned references at the top of the answers (regardless of voting activity). Being a wiki, no user will get reputation credit for it, as is right for a compilation of everyone's answers.&#xD;&#xA; - The other answers, all sharing the property of not being accepted, will be automatically sorted via the voting process. &#xD;&#xA; - Users who post answers will get reputation credit for the quality of their answers as per normal.&#xD;&#xA; - A random web surfer hitting our page should find first the question, second a complete list of references, and following that answers with references and explanations, sorted by quality (votes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, I believe it sets up a system where the existing SE engine will provide the proper incentive for good useful answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drawbacks of this approach:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - It requires an extra step from the person asking the question. Often such people are brand-new users who are likely to have more trouble than most comprehending jargon like &quot;accept button&quot; and &quot;wiki answer&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;  - It requires extra moderation work from alert and knowledgeable users.&#xD;&#xA;  - It doesn't solve the fundamental issue of such questions being solicitations of personal opinion.&#xD;&#xA;  - Its a big experiment. As far as I know, no stack has done something like this. It seems to me it ought to work, but nobody knows how it will perform in practice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/book-recommendation" />

As is, I worry that SE's reputation system would pervert incentives too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What Does OP Want From a Recommendation Thread?* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A list of only the best books. We all know that there are more good history books than there are days left in our lives, so we only want to read what are truly the best.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What Does an Answerer Do If There is No Reputation To Be Gained?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Recommend a book that they absolutely love. This matches up well with with OP's wants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What Does an Answerer Do If There is Reputation To Be Gained?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, I think the system breaks down here because we are basically setting up a [Keynesian Beauty Contest][1]. There's going to be a mad race to be &quot;first&quot; when someone asks for recommendations about the Roman Empire, because answering &quot;Edward Gibbon&quot; might net you 400 easy points. But even after all of the big names are taken, some users will be incentivized to search Amazon for a book on Rome that hasn't made the list yet, and they'll add it hoping to get a few easy upvotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe this is contradictory of me because I think the reputation system, though not perfect, generally creates healthy incentives for SE. I think that's because normally, the quality of our answers themselves is being judged--wanting an extra upvote pushes you to do extra research, extra proofing, extra thinking. But for book recommendations, the referent of our answers is being judged. You can't write a better answer (Edward Gibbon is already as good as he is going to get), so wanting an extra upvote pushes you to post additional recommendations. So I both worry that signal will get lost in the noise, and that some of these threads will become de facto pinned to the top of &quot;active questions.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only way to take reputation out of the equation would be to force all OPs to make their questions community wikis (which forces all answers to be community wikis) or to host these questions in Meta. (I know the latter isn't practical, but I'd actually like it because then we could freely downvote books we don't like without costing others rep.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's possible that community pressures would keep everyone in check, or maybe I'm too concerned that some users would try to game the system.

The former is a question of historiography, and factual, because historians write books and publish articles. Their opinions and conclusions are verifiable facts that can be cited and referenced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The latter **can** be answered as a historiography, but usually is not. It tends to be approached as &quot;why do YOU think Y happened&quot;, and when you pick one of &quot;several different interpretations based on available historical data&quot;, that is **exactly** what  *primarily opinion based* is. Citing &quot;historical data&quot; doesn't mean an answer wasn't opinion based; in your example specifically, most answers were simply making assertions without really backing them up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, a question like that can usually be easily reworded into a historiography one. For example, *&quot;Why do historians think atomic weapons were used to Japan?&quot;* is a historiography question. An answer will be able to cite historians to discuss what their views are. And it probably answers the original asker's question too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem is that without specifying a focus on historiography. many people tend to write answers that reads like little more than their personal opinions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I might vote to close a &quot;why...?&quot; question based on how its written, and vote to reopen if it is edited to be actually about historiography." />

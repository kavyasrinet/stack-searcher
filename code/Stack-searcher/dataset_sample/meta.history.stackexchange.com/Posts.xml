Tag synonyms only serve to &lt;em&gt;directly rename&lt;/em&gt; tags from one to the other. So you could not, for example, group all of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4th&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged '4th'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;4th&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/15th&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged '15th'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;15th&lt;/a&gt; century tags under an umbrella &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/middle-ages&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'middle-ages'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;middle-ages&lt;/a&gt; without sacrificing the ability to individually use the sub-tags for each century. You also could not create a correlation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww2&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'ww2'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ww2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/20th-century&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged '20th-century'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;20th-century&lt;/a&gt; mechanically unless you were trying to say they were equivalent. You would have to keep the tags separate in order to properly use them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lack of mechanical assistance to this endeavor also leads me to have low expectations on the success of such double-tagging in practice when the site is opened up. You are likely to have users who will only use the event tag, rather than the period/century tag, which would require a lot of upkeep on the community to maintain proper tagging. Without constant vigilance and maintenance, it will quickly result that questions with the event tags will not always have the corresponding period/century tag, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternate option that is available is to provide custom tag sets through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;http://stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;tagged questions&lt;/code&gt; section. You can create a tag filter that would select, say, all of the events pertinent to a particular period or century. So for example, you would include &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww1&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'ww1'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ww1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww2&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'ww2'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ww2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cold-war&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'cold-war'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cold-war&lt;/a&gt; (I know there's more to history than wars, but those were 3 easy picks) under the &quot;20th century&quot; tag filter, and similar filters for other centuries. You could also group events or centuries with particular periods like the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tag filters can then be subscribed to, by email or by RSS feed, to allow for monitoring in a similar fashion as with favorite tags.

Sure, each single fact is usually already available online. But finding the connection between them and explaining how it all fits together - that's something that even many history books fail on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, we all know that machine guns and similar technical advances made &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/230/when-was-the-last-cavalry-charge&quot;&gt;cavalry attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/308/when-were-swords-last-used-in-european-warfare&quot;&gt;cold weapons&lt;/a&gt; useless in modern warfare. But it couldn't have happened overnight. So when did this change actually happen? How long did various armies hold onto them and why? Now we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions are &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/71/why-did-hitler-attack-the-soviet-union-when-he-was-still-busy-fighting-britain&quot;&gt;far too complicated to be researched in full here&lt;/a&gt;.

Oh, and I changed my opinion into the exact opposite after researching that question - oops...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we seem to dig up something that is genuinely new. Up until now if you asked which Confederate state contributed the most soldiers to the army you were bound to end up with North Carolina. &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/169/which-confederate-state-provided-the-most-troops-in-the-american-civil-war/394#394&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; we don't only have the correct answer and an explanation as to why the numbers are unreliable, but also the most likely source of the North Carolina theory - some facts have been put together than only existed separately before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think that it is a problem of scope.

To back up our answers, I think we should encourage the use of (1) relevant primary source material (quotes from participants, archeological findings, etc) and (2) Works by historians who are experts in fields related to the answer. We should discourage citing Wikipedia and other tertiary sources. Wikipedia may be useful when writing an answer to get at good historical works through their citations, or it may be ok to link in some tangential information, but we should discourage the citation of Wikipedia to directly backup claims. Claims should be backed up with concrete stuff that happened in the past that you can point to, not a Wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen some answers that are great, weigh different pieces of evidence from important sources. I've unfortunately seen other answers that are lacking, contain a simple link to a Wikipedia page, or a blatant statement of fact not backed up by anything other than maybe what Wikipedia said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not bashing on Wikipedia, I just want to know more.

Wikipedia and other sources are just too damn good: many questions that most people would think of can be looked up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how about this. Suppose there is a rather specific question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Why did Columbus think he had landed in Asia? Didn't he know that Asia was much farther to the west?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can easily be looked up in the Wikipedia article on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

They are after all part of history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as we know conspiracy theories only persist through willful ignorance of fact, reason, and science, on which our historical knowledge and study is based on, just like every other discipline. So if the person asking the question is also willfully ignorant of these things, there is nothing we can do for them and should either close the question or, at best, flag it for migration to Skeptics (which I currently feel should be criteria for a predefined migration path via close vote, but it's still too early to tell that for sure).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should expect SOME crossover between Skeptics and this; that is no different than most sites having some crossover.

As a moderator on another SE site, I saw someone answering questions that often mentioned the product he writes and sells. At first I was like &quot;ugh, this guy is peddling his product&quot; but after reading a post or two, I realized he was a very smart man who had researched his topic very, very thoroughly and was able to use his experience to help solve peoples problems. Then at the end he kindly put &quot;I solved this problem, and a few more, with my tool -yada yada-&quot;. If I would have dismissed his original research right then, three or four people that week would have had a tougher time with serious problems they were facing at work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is uniquely different than Skeptics. To the best of my knowledge (and I stand to be corrected) &lt;strong&gt;there are no professional degrees, certifications, or other recognitions in ConspiracyTheoryOlogy&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. While there are certainly plenty who devote their life to analyzing conspiracy theories (images of guys with huge bushy beards living in trailers in the mountains or underground bunkers come to mind) none of them are accredited by a university or professional trade organization or anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should take any original research from a non-professional with a grain of salt as amateur. This is not to say completely dismiss it, but to keep in mind that it did indeed come from an amateur. On Skeptics, due to the lack of any non-amateur by definition, it is very easy to say &quot;This will get out of hand, so we will require sources in all instances.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we should also point out that Wikipedia does allow for research published elsewhere (journals, websites, etc) to edit the content to include as long as it's done so fairly. This fairness is enforced by the community who constantly review each page (which if you actually look, even the 'forgotten' pages have a fairly recent last update date!!) I imagine if someone on the Skeptics site had published an article in a professional and recognized science journal that they would be able to cite it, and perhaps even include other evidence not published there, based on their obvious professional and expert status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, with the number of professionals we have (and certainly hope to have) we should keep original research on a long leash. That is to say, not unbounded. There should be an expectation that original research is either called out (on SO and other sites, I often put [citation needed] in the comments, especially when someone's like &quot;Java is slow, use assembly, man!&quot; or some other unfounded claim) or backed up by professional credentials. I would not be comfortable with someone being both professional and anonymous. If you want me to trust your original, unpublished research on THIS topic, I want to see your original &lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt; research on other topics. In other words, I want to see credible evidence of your ability to perform meaningful research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, laying down guidelines of what is and isn't allowed for original research will help us remain objective. If someone crosses what we define as the guidelines, we can gently point them here (and ideally this would belong in the FAQ, which we know all members of online communities read before they post, right?

It's like a &quot;script languages&quot; or &quot;ancient philosophy&quot; tag, it covers too many times in too many diff. places, but no historical topics, developments belonging/influencing to each other. &lt;strong&gt;Do we need three time tags like ancient history, roman empire, 2nd century.&lt;/strong&gt; This is imho redundant.

The century tags give you exact periods. World War 2 happened at a very specific time. The Middle Ages, while disputed on the exact length at times, are still a very specific period of time that is defined as being that time. These all work as tags because when someone looks at that period, they know when it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The existence of this question is evidence to the contrary when it comes to periods where their definition is &lt;em&gt;relative to the current period&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient-history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'ancient-history'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ancient-history&lt;/a&gt; is actually more problematic because of its nebulous nature - when does ancient start? It is simply not an understood term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar tags include &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/early-modern&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'early-modern'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;early-modern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contemporary-history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'contemporary-history'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;contemporary-history&lt;/a&gt;, and these illustrate more strongly the issue with relative general tags since their period of operation is likely to be affected in near future of this website. Early modern extends how far back? In a few years, does it still count as early modern, will we have to &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; tags?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags are not meant to be dynamically changing - they're intended to be a static descriptor that helps you strongly identify what a question is about. If a tag's validity is affected by the passage of time because it is relative to present day, then it is extremely suspect as a tag. This kind of effect is a bit more visible on other sites like Gaming, where we have &quot;old-games&quot; and &quot;retro-games&quot; tags that just no one is sure what counts as that because of how fast the game generations span out. On History, it'll take centuries to affect things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient-history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'ancient-history'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ancient-history&lt;/a&gt;, but it still is far more useful if there is a more definitive descriptor about the actual era in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a side note, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient-greece&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'ancient-greece'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ancient-greece&lt;/a&gt;.

This is because there is a myriad of potential variables which could intervene that go well beyond any particular tactical or even strategic decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in the context of a specific military engagement there is always the countering question of what other actors would have done in response, which is often difficult to answer.

Personally, when I encounter questions I would like to ask but have a &quot;gut check&quot; that says I should think about it then either my question is ill-formed or ill-suited.  When framed correctly historical questions can typically be answered, but usually there is not just one correct answer, in many ways thats where I feel the History SE site sort of diverges.  Since SE aims for one question with one correct answer it's hard to say if there is one that is the most correct, mostly I go with the most suitable.

Funnily, covering worldwide history often poorly and not showing interesting questions from people from the other side of the globe makes me often watch history.se.

Obviously this puts us at a disadvantage as experts in history are less likely to come to our corner of SE as opposed to say network professionals to the technical side of SE.

It seems like we should reach out to people who have an academic background in history.  It's good that we are getting quite a few people, like myself, who have an active interest in history, but no academic credentials, but it would certainly be good to have people who have devoted their careers to the study.  I don't know if this has been considered, but maybe we should reach out to the various history departments throughout the world?  It would be really nifty if professors asked questions here for their students to participate in.  This seems like a good example of us being able to use the &quot;technical-fetishism&quot; displayed by many academic institutions to our benefit.  Also, I'd imagine that many professors would have an inclination to help us advance the spread of historical interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we lack experts, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/204/742&quot;&gt;Hauser notes in TED's thread&lt;/a&gt;, we also lack diversity in interest.  Again this could be improved by reaching out to institutions or various groups that have an interest in a specific historical field.  It would be nice if we could implement specialty into the site's mechanics, possibly by letting users select one or two historical fields to specialize in (or automatically selecting a specialty for users based on the tags of questions they answered, possibly modified by the reputation attached to each answer).  We could also have incentives for having uncommon specialties such as providing badges or incentive bonuses for a certain amount of posts for uncommon tags.             &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this has been considered or if it's necessarily a good idea, but maybe offering users similar incentives as the above mentioned point for directing users to the site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway just some things to consider.

It might be best to get college students who are majoring in History interested, especially those who might go on to MA's who might be able to add their specialization.  Current students tend to be more acclimated to technology and be more willing to utilize online sites like here.  I'll have to see about more promotion of the site in my alumni network for those who might be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastActivityDate="2012-05-06T11:25:08.113" CommentCount="0" />

I see there's been some discussion about whether answers should provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/1/should-we-include-sources-in-answers&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt;, and personally I think on a site dealing with history they really should. Especially since, if I understand the answers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/questions/236/why-does-the-faq-prominently-ask-for-questions-based-on-actual-problems-that-yo&quot;&gt;my earlier question&lt;/a&gt; correctly, this site is not supposed to be a problem-oriented SE site where answers are mostly evaluated on their helpfulness, but an understanding-oriented SE site where answers are mostly evaluated on their accuracy. This puts me in a dilemma when seeing the many answers on this site that do seem “insightful” or “well-written” but which do not seem particularly “well-researched” because they don't provide any references. Should I up-vote anyway or withhold completely? It makes me wish I could do something like cast a half vote to incentivize the answerer to further improve the answer by providing references.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I have two questions really: (1) Should there be some way, that is not tangled up in the many different things an up vote can express, to incentivize answerers to provide well-researched answers? (2) If so, I assume an addition like half votes or any other site-specific mechanism (“scholarship ratings”?) is unlikely to be added to the SE software, but is there something else that could be done?

For the average person the majority of their questions can be answered on wikipedia with answers that generally include source(s), but in a way is lacking the human element/discussion. There are many other Q&amp;amp;A sites that are decent (at best) in the answers provided. I am really beginning to feel that in order to generate site usage and site popularity (search engine results) we need to &lt;strong&gt;worry less about the question asked and more about the elite answer provided&lt;/strong&gt;. Our biggest advantage may be our ability to provide &lt;strong&gt;multiple elite answers&lt;/strong&gt; along with the &lt;strong&gt;human element&lt;/strong&gt; provided within discussion (comment/chat). We as a site likely do lack historical knowledge in some arena, but with the site being recognized more and more via increased results in popular search engine we may quickly recover in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crux of the matter is that a hard question is likely to have gone through the process of...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;checking to make sure wikipedia doesn't provide an answer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is not a top search result in popular search engines&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hasn't been asked yet on our site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This process &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; impact our site negatively in two ways. First and the more obvious, we don't get another question. The second is a bit less obvious, but a person who took the time to check other popular resources is much more likely to be led to the answer on their own. This is true for even questions that aren't answered on wikipedia or other popular places. This may be good for that person, but bad for us.

It's horribly biased, and it reads more like something I would expect to read on the author's personal blog than on a high quality canonical resource on history. I'm not questioning the author's opinions and I don't necessarily disagree with him (her?), but I am questioning whether opinion heavy answers is what the site is for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/a/4504/739&quot;&gt;other answer&lt;/a&gt; is presented in a impartial way, but also doesn't really answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing personal with either answerer, my peeve is with the question.

There is definitely no shortage of questions on this or any other SE site that could be considered sketchy, but we as moderators can't always act on every single one of them. We are volunteers who try to spend as much time as we can looking over the site and trying to keep it as current and relevant as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, I personally do not ever read about 25% of the questions on this site when they are first submitted because I simply do not have the time. I eventually get around to reading all of them, but sometimes it may be a week or so after they are posted. I can't speak for other moderators, but I suspect they do not see most questions on the day they are submitted. (New answers are even harder to keep up with, but I won't go into that right now.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of our limited time, we rely on the community to help bring our attention to potential problems. They do this by voting to close a question or by flagging it if they believe there is something that needs to be addressed. Pretty much every single day I look at every question that is flagged or voted on for closing or reopening. Questions or answers submitted by new users are automatically flagged, as are answers to older questions, so all of these get my attention first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The short and simple answer is that this question got flagged and voted for closing, while most of the other questions did not. When we receive a flag, we have to make a decision based on a number of factors, and sometimes it comes down to just a personal evaluation. We are not always going to satsify everyone, but we certainly try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, speaking for me personally, one of the first things I look at is the number of commenst vs. answers. This question has 9-0, which means it easily falls into the category of one that &lt;em&gt;will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion&lt;/em&gt;. Those are easy decisions for me when it comes to a request to close!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor I consider is the number of votes (up or down) for either the question or any answers. Pretty much all of the examples you gave have good participation from the community, and as a moderator, we will very rarely do anything with one of those. At some point in the future as we get closer to becoming a full site, we will be required to clean up a lot of those or remove them, but until then the moderators are not going to act on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don't claim to have the perfect solution. It is simply one in which we rely largely on the community to help give us guidance. All of these factors are weighed individually (and quite honestly, sometimes with some personal prejudice) before we decide how to act on them. As long as the community remains active and provides their feedback, we will be there trying to help mold this site into what you guys want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="85" LastActivityDate="2012-11-17T14:52:49.727" CommentCount="8" />

There are many technical reasons that a person might not be able to use the top-voted answer, so it's helpful to have a way of privileging a less popular answer that works for their specific situation.  It's a win-win because the asker can signal the answer that actually solved their problem and the community can signal the answer that is generally seen as &quot;best&quot;.  (Often it's the same answer, which is convenient.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I've noticed that some sites don't work that way.  On a site like History.SE, the asker might be the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; person to pick a canonical answer.  Or at least, there's nothing special about the asker since they don't have any unique problems that need to be solved in an answer.  In a sense, the asker of a History question is not asking for themselves or their own circumstances, but for anyone who will use Google to search for answers.  When Joe Googler discovers that an answer has been accepted by History.SE (we can't expect him to know that accepted answers are chosen by the asker alone), he will naturally assume that the answer has been given some sort of stamp of approval.  That can be a mistaken assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've floated &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.christianity.stackexchange.com/a/1402/914&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/408/68&quot;&gt;other sites&lt;/a&gt; that have the same profile.  My plan is to develop a consensus across a number of sites in order to propose something on Meta.StackExchange.com.  A &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2014/why-did-civil-war-officers-tell-their-men-to-aim-low/5900#comment10372_5900&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on an answer to one of my questions here, spurred me to bring this up here.  Obviously, I'm not really active here (yet?), but I get the sense that Accepted answers might be a stumbling block for users not intimately familiar with Stack Overflow.  Feel free to vote up or down this question to indicate whether or not you feel this change would help your community.  And also, feel free to answer with alternative proposals for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answers that have been &quot;Accepted&quot; by the asker are no longer pinned to the top of the answer queue.  All other effects of accepting an answer will remain the same on History.SE, but the accepted answer will be sorted just like any other answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="690" LastActivityDate="2012-12-13T19:58:50.597" Title="Should preferential sorting for &quot;Accepted&quot; answers be removed?"

An upvote is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the traditional welcoming gift (it's usually a nice comment). If a post by a new user is good and worthy, by all means, upvote it. If it's a so-so post or even just wrong, don't go sympathy upvoting to 'welcome' the user. Help him/her out by leaving a constructive comment. Vote for the post, not the user. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sympathy voting has two major problems: it encourages so-so to just wrong posts and it can remove all new user restrictions for that user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a new user writes a not-so-great post and it's upvoted out of sympathy (rather than because it was a great post), the new user now has a distorted view of what is a quality post and what needs work. Leave a constructive comment to help them a along, but don't upvote the post because it's a first post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/privileges/new-user&quot;&gt;New user restrictions&lt;/a&gt; are removed at 10 rep.

Sympathy upvoting destroys the whole point of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So just keep in mind that the next time you see the first post of a new user, you're shaping their SE experience.

I cant possibly follow every archeological journal, specialist, publication, university, etc etc. We need a source of reliable, scientific, high quality knowledge.

Some of the illustrations of medieval armour are more fantasy than history in books that are supposed to be educational!

I looked through some of the questions on the site and I dont feel they are answerable in an expert manner. If someone asks about causality of some events, how one thing or person affected another etc. The answer will be either speculative, or would need an entire scientific article or book to write it down. Many questions are really difficult to answer, meaning - it would take an enormous effort to give a reasonable answer. Examples? &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2312/how-did-medieval-armies-survive-the-use-of-mail-armor-in-the-deserts-of-the-midd&quot;&gt;How did Medieval Armies survive the use of mail armor in the deserts of the Middle East?&lt;/a&gt;. The top rated answer took the right course - the scientific way would be to do experimental archeology. In Poland we actually have a group who does such things. They equip them selves nearly 100% historically (they even use hand-woven materials for their clothes) and travel by foot and by horse, eat historically prepped foot on such journes etc etc. They have gained a LOT of high quality knowlege about travelling in the middle ages.

My involvement with another research-based site shows me that there are two definite shifts in how questions/answers are presented in academic sites and places like SE where the community is more involved in how reputation and answers are perceived.  Experts in some areas, and I can luckily say some of my history professors were not like this, can be prickly when their research and authority in subjects is attacked, which will happen in SE.  I've seen it happen in many questions on SE History as a mod, though it's a small portion of what I've seen it may be a stumbling block with others getting involved.  Especially considering the &quot;burn&quot; others may have had in previous exposures to SE sites and involvement in public forums like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember these are people who spend their time as experts in subjects and some do not take direct challenges well to their knowledge of subjects.  While getting younger members of the community may help, as they are more familiar with the social media aspects of online communities and may have thicker skins for criticism that may arise.  Introducing them to SE History may be good, but the introduction has to draw them in, and I am not sure even the current state of SE History questions is enough to bring them in.  I know this goes back to the question quality problem we struggled with early on, and I can see it somewhat still happens, but then this is for people to have questions who may or may not be History professionals or academics, it's a place for answers.  Consider as well, that while we have stressed in the past that answers should have some documentation for them, not all do.  Many are someone's recollection or knowledge put out there, and some have sources to back up the statements, and many sources are not Wikipedia.  What would be the expectation of an academic who is more used to using sources to back up their thesis or paper?

When you start using words that may be construed as a verbal attack on others or may be interpreted as inflamatory, then you are not doing much to make yourself appear to be a sincere and committed participant of this site. I can guarantee that if you have more downvotes than upvotes, or even more than 10% of your total votes are downvotes, you are very likely to have your account suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of a vote is NOT a weapon or tool that you can use to &quot;get even&quot; with someone. It should ONLY be used to reflect how well you think the question was answered or how well you think a question was asked.

While it makes obvious sense to replace tags with more specific ones as they become available, it doesn't serve anyone to have a thousand tags with one entry in them, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with a site simply called &quot;history&quot; is that there are many approaches to history. Some have an interest in a time period, others in a particular civilization or cultural group, others in an aspect of human society across time periods and civilizations, others in a particular school of analysis applicable to all of the above.  As the site is still in its relative infancy, we lack a complete set of tags for all those angles, (we don't even have &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/angles&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'angles'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;angles&lt;/a&gt;). Moreover, we are also limited to five tags per question, and there is no way to set up hierarchical relationships between tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a thousand tags with a single question in each doesn't make it easy to follow questions about the same topic. You subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/military&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'military'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; but didn't see my question?

Then we observe that several other answers by the same individual, all with more than ten upvotes and no downvotes, start to receive single downvotes, and they are all from the same individual. I give this specific example because this actually happened (but I'm not saying it was you who did it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly, unless you are going through every Q&amp;amp;A on the site and downvoting only the ones that have already received multiple downvotes, you are going to be flagged. It doesn't matter if you use one or one hundred, if they are not justified, then you will be suspeneded again, and this time for a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="85" LastActivityDate="2013-03-23T14:02:57.290" CommentCount="7" />

IMHO, staff members of the Stack Exchange (SE) should have &quot;full&quot; moderator privileges to close and delete questions and answers, and suspend members, etc. This is so that they can protect us all from what I call the three P's (profanity, pornography, and plagiarism), and similar problems (the fourth p). That's their &quot;day job&quot; and the fact that their jobs, reputations and livelihoods are on the line gives them the requisite &quot;skin in the game&quot; to do this effectively. The following comments are meant to relate to &quot;non=paid&quot; moderators drawn from the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, a moderator can unilaterally close a question, which can also be done with FIVE votes from qualified members of the community. Meaning that a moderator in effect has five close (or reopen) votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &quot;three vote&quot; moderater would have three, not five votes to close or open a question, which is to say no such unilateral power. Instead, it would take TWO moderators (six votes) to close or reopen a question, or a moderator and two senior community members. It often happens that questions are closed this latter way; two or three community members vote to close, and a moderator comes along and &quot;finishes&quot; the job without the need for five votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could come about in two ways. We could either limit all moderators to three votes, or have two classes of moderators: One or two people with five close votes, and the others with three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was offered a chance by Anna Lear to be a pro temp moderator for the site. I respectfully declined, partly because of day job pressures, and partly because I was uncomfortable with a moderator's unilateral closing powers. One reason I declined was that if I had full moderator privileges (and resp;onsibilities), it would have felt too much like a &quot;day job,&quot; (and perhaps detracted from my real one.) If I had been given a chance to be a &quot;three vote&quot; moderator, I might have accepted it, since I could contribute to the site with extra votes that reflect my high reputation, but without having to &quot;sweat out&quot; whether I was doing the right thing by unilaterally closing something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I've been spending a lot of time on the site recently, in spite of myself. One way I justify this is by the fact that a number of what purport to be history questions are really &quot;day job&quot; questions in disguise. For instance, this question about troops with different backgrounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8054/at-the-battle-of-zama-was-the-roman-army-more-native-than-the-carthaginian/8268#8268&quot;&gt;At the Battle of Zama, was the Roman army more &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; than the Carthaginian?&lt;/a&gt; could really be a question about the relative strengths of moderators drawn from SE vs. the Community.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do others think about having a group of moderators from the community with &quot;limited&quot; powers? That is three votes instead of five on close/open questions, and perhaps the power to &quot;supend&quot; accounts for brief periods (to send a message to SE moderators) but not to delete them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="120" LastEditorUserId="961" LastEditDate="2013-04-10T12:44:07.457" LastActivityDate="2014-04-23T09:04:03.580" Title="Should we have &quot;three vote&quot; moderators from the community?"

Now if you are asking about a really specific event within a larger framework, such as your Atlanta campaign question, that I think is okay for a couple of reasons. First, when you get down to that level of granularity there is probably more effort required to answer such a question, thus making it a better fit for the stack format.

I would have just posted the above link in a comment and ask them to be a bit more thorough with their research.

Closing a question is just our way to notify every future reader that the question has some problems, and nothing more. Yes, I fully realize that from the perspective of the asker it might sting a bit, but how about we start thinking about everyone else as well?

And let's not forget that the OP here didn't give us any reason to believe that they were &quot;hurt&quot; by the closure or that they care more about their rep than getting clear guidance on what's &quot;wrong&quot; with their question. In fact, the only evident result of the closure is that it may have inspired Zik to do a bit more research (which is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good thing) and ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/194196/25936&quot;&gt;a more specific and less easy to answer question&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Programmers Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I wouldn't mind programming or computing history questions on History, but they are also perfectly on topic on Programmers.

Also, I would have probably been the one to close it, as I am a moderator on the site and one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/tags/history/topusers&quot;&gt;more active users&lt;/a&gt; on the tag. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize that saying I would have closed the question on Programmers when I've answered it on History seems a bit like I'm treating History as a lesser site, and for that I apologize.

Here, the question is &quot;limited&quot; in scope insofar as it refers to one event that has a clear beginning and end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the question about the &quot;Resistance&quot; in Czechoslovakia in 1938 is open-ended. First of all, there was NO &quot;Resistance&quot; in Czechoslovakia in 1938 when it was still a (nominally) independent country. The Cezch part of the country was taken over in March 1939, and the Resistance was organized later. And when the OP writes &quot;I need to know what happened to the hero,&quot; whom did he meet, what would he have done, etc. it's like asking a &quot;homework question.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An aspiring novelist is supposes to know these things! For us on SE to try to answer such a query is an invitation to a limitless set of answers. We would practically end up writing the novel itself, which is what we're NOT supposed to do on SE. A better question might be, would my hero have had a chance to meet President Benes at such and such a time and place.

We really don't want a site that's full of obvious answers, that would get extremely boring very fast. However it's extremely difficult to define a common baseline for the amount of prior research required. Each and every one of us has different standards, expectations and skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do we maintain sanity, then? Well, that's easy, by combining our different standards, expectations and skills. It takes five votes from high(ish) rep users to close a question (i.e. deem it unsuitable), one or even four persons' opinions don't really mean much. I'd go as far as say that if you don't agree with one person's opinion of your question, you can just ignore it, at least until it becomes obvious what the community's opinion is. There's one notable exception, the people with diamonds next to their usernames; they are moderators exactly because we trust them to single handedly do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I don't think I'm in any way a representative user, just to give you an example, my workflow for determining prior research is a five minute search. I take the more important keywords from the question, enter them into Google and:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I find the answer, I'll downvote the question and move on (remember: a downvote's primary purpose is to show the post is ill researched or ill defined). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I find relevant information (but not the answer), I will comment and share that information (primarily to help anyone else researching the question). If I feel that information would have made the question clearer and was relatively easy to find, I'll probably downvote. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I don't find anything, I &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; upvote the question. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I continue researching the question past the five minute threshold, I will most definitely upvote it. There aren't many questions that keep me interested for more than five minutes, and those that do deserve my upvote.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing everyone has their own workflow, and I should note that (obviously) my workflow only applies to questions that aren't a mess to begin with. I wouldn't spend five minutes on rants (in disguise or not), &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; trivial questions and questions in broken English (on these, my five minutes are better spent in editing the question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both your questions pass my &quot;five minute test&quot;. Obviously, the Australia one didn't pass someone else's equivalent test, but that's both understandable and expected. Some people on the site will be a lot more familiar with certain areas than others, and will be able to dig up relevant information and possibly the answer almost instantly. So what, as I've already mentioned, you shouldn't lose any sleep over what one person thinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you ignore the condescending tone of the comments, what remains is that someone familiar with the subject matter of your question answered it, almost immediately.

That's not so bad, is it? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'm not suggesting that the ends justify the means. The comments, although not outright rude, weren't particularly helpful and you could have just flagged them. Or, just ignore them.

The person at the other end of the line might just be tired, or having a bad day, or whatever, and they screwed up with their comment. Or you might just be misinterpreting the comments.

There are exceptions - &quot;How many years did the 1812 war last?&quot;, or &quot;How many patents did G. W. Carver have?. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Double check that you're asking for a &quot;closed answer&quot; - an answer, not a list. Then see if there is a way to rephrase the question so that it is really what you want.  Sometimes this question is phrased as &quot;What were the ... names of people on the Titanic?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;When did you stop beating your wife? (e.g. What is the timeframe for adam and eve?)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with these questions. First, the timeframe isn't mentioned. If you're asking about behavior X in Roman History, the answer is generally meaningless unless you specify what period of Roman History.  &quot;What is the role of a censor in Roman government?&quot;  Depends on whether we're talking empire, republic, late empire, or June 7, 45 BCE.  &quot;Who is the Secretary of State?&quot; Depends on which administration, and which year. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other problem is questions that rely on assumptions - like the assumption that I beat my wife, or that I'm married. &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/8875/1401&quot;&gt;Example 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/434/1401&quot;&gt;Example 2&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before you ask the question, first, specify a time period, and if possible an event. It is much easier to provide a comprehensive answer if you specify an event; we can research  teh causes and effects of that event and discuss them intelligently.  Second, doublecheck that the majority of the people accept all the assumptions.  Sometimes this will cause me to eat crow; there are questions where the assumptions aren't obvious.  But it is worth your while to take a moment to make sure that all the terms  in your question are meaningful to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Can you evaluate the impact of Sujarkama's theory of mesonic exchange entitlements on the gross national product of the Jawethi province of Kronos under Reaganomics?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask a question which relies on obscure details, &lt;strong&gt;without citing those details&lt;/strong&gt; I will downvote you. If you ask a question that relies on obscure details and you cite those details, providing me the opportunity to learn something new, I will upvote you and cause fuzzy unicorns to bring you waffles.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of H:SE isn't to demonstrate your intellectual power &amp;amp; puissance; it is to get an answer to a question.  If you can't be bothered to cite your sources, then there is a gravitational force drawing my mouse to the downvote button.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Someone once said that... ; is that true?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two problems with this question, and I'll wish for the ability to downvote twice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, cite your source. It makes a big difference if the &quot;someone&quot; who once said is a 3rd century monk, a member of the Nazi party in 1938, Paul Krugman, or Noam Chomsky. They all have different biases; they are reliable for different classes of fact. If you don't identify the source, then we're both playing darts in the dark, potentially in an open field.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second problem is that this is very close to the example given in the FAQ of a question &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; to ask. &quot;your question is just a rant in disguise: “&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt; sucks, am I right?”. If you're looking for people to confirm your opinion, H:SE is the wrong place.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn, then do the basic research to enable scholarship. Tell us who said it, and then follow up with a question. &quot;Disraeli said that ancient Greeks had no word for 'blue'; what color did they think the sky was?&quot; Still tough to answer, but there is at least a starting point for research.

The example you gave of a question asking &quot;how widespread&quot; is another example that starts to cross the line.

For something like this, I would usually ask the original poster to modify the question to make it more appropriate with our guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there is a specific standard that has been established for all SE sites, and we ask that everyone adhere to that standard.

I realized that in fact the question wasn't subjective; that I have read references to scholarly articles that made precisely this claim.  I had a knee jerk reaction to phrases like &quot;colonial masters&quot; that are not infrequently used irresponsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to agree with @Vector's tone or presentation, nor defend use of flags, etc. I am most explictly not going to argue against @Steven Drennon's response, which I think is correct and useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do think that there is an issue we should examine.  History is a subtle subject, full of complexity, contradiction and unreliable reporters.  Historians frequently disagree with one another; there are many many historical subjects for which there is no single best answer.  (and the answers change; when I was growing up, Whig History was popular. When I was in college, Marxist development distory was the  One True Faith. Today we have different trends).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SE has a different aesthetic/culture/preference.  SE arises from more technical environments where there is more likely to be a single best answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each SE site can and does differentiate from the core principles. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt; I think that if we are to be successful at departing from the core principles, we need to clearly document how, why and what the limits are. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Subjective vs Objective&lt;/a&gt;.  I do not think there is a simple answer to this question. History is going to be more subjective than (for example) security.stackexchange.com.  We need to develop and continuously refine our own definition of good subjective and counterproductive subjective.  I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; that H:SE's interpretation of good subjective includes answers based on phrases like &quot;success of the resulting state is a subjective term, but if we allow GDP to stand in as a measure for success, then....&quot; If you'll permit me to abuse my own example, then I'll quickly point out that such answers lead inevitably to disagreement, and Lists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/q/667/1401&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/a&gt;.   (I'll move this to that question if it is deemed more productive). History is an ongoing discussion of multiple correct answers.  I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; have an answer as to how we can reconcile the practice of history with SE preference for single best answers.  I believe it is worth examining the problem, developing and continuously refining an answer.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Respect. Respectful language, respectful comments, respectful questions. We need to be very careful to be civil and respectful to one another, and to those affected by the questions.  I now admit that I was unjust to &quot;knee jerk&quot; in response to &quot;colonial masters&quot;, but I'd just read another question that bordered on racial profiling.  &lt;strong&gt;NOTE WITH EMPHASIS&lt;/strong&gt;  I recognize that many participants on H:SE are either (a) not native English speakers, and therefore not aware of the subtle implications of some phrases - &quot;poofy pants&quot; comes to mind as an example of a phrase that wasn't intended to offend or amuse, but which has a different meaning in different cultures.  We have to live with that reality (b) some of the participants are new to history and aren't aware of some of the groundwork. I made those same erroneous assumptions when I was just starting to study history. We have to be respectful when we point out that the world is more complicated.  (c) legitimate differences of opinion.  @Samuel Russell &amp;amp; I come from very different assumption sets; it would be very difficult for us to hold a conversation on many historical topics because we don't agree on the fundamentals. (Once he used the term &quot;valorization&quot;, I realized that we simply wouldn't bridge the gap.) I don't think he's wrong, I just think he applies a different set of assumptions and methods to analyze history.  I prefer my assumptions and methodologies.  Fortunately we've been very respectful of one another, and I'd be happy to buy him a beer and discuss any non-economic issue.  I'll upvote his answers in many cases because they are well researched, well thought through, and well written.  Sometimes I'll upvote his, and then add my own answer because although I respect his opinion, I simply come from a different place.

It does not matter if the subject is popular history or about some insignificant trivia or an identification of something in a photo; they all form into the umbrella of 'history'. Such style of questions are commonly asked on Stack Overflow and no one has any issue (e.g. &quot;here is my code snippet, what am I doing wrong?&quot; questions are fine on SO). There are plenty of proper academia sites if you want to discuss 'proper' history, let us hobbyists and amateurs have some fun too :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, we should make sure that anything to do with ice road truckers or lumberjacks or aliens be swiftly purged lest we turn into a certain TV channel I won't name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stay on this site purely as a hobby, if suddenly it becomes against site policy to ask simple 'trivia' questions then I wouldn't have any reason to stay anymore.

Not only do you vastly increase the value of the site as a reference source and learning aid, but you may disambiguate the question.

I'm a Community Manager for Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, a vote represents the opinion of a user, to identify whether a question is &lt;strong&gt;useful&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;not useful&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to points about clarity and research and whatnot. Voting is the tool for the community as a whole to judge posts. It is as much to identify when a question is poorly written as it is to identify that the problem being asked about... really isn't worth anyone's time. There are ultimately three states to a vote, though, and there's always the option to simply &quot;not vote&quot; when you think a question is not very helpful in your own analysis but figure that others may find it worthwhile or helpful when pursuing that route. Basically, if a post qualifies as &quot;not interesting enough to upvote&quot;, you're valid to not vote on it instead to express the lack of interest, and a downvote is unnecessary unless you feel it is a negative to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're not downvoting just to express your opinion. You're downvoting to express your opinion on the validity of a topic to the community. Taking a personal voting grudge on, say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/china&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'china'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;china&lt;/a&gt; here because you loathe the country and everyone in it, that would be petty. You may still vote as such, as it is your opinion to give, but it's not a very healthy way to go about voting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if there was a subject matter on which you feel that dealing with questions about them is not useful to &lt;em&gt;anyone in the community&lt;/em&gt;, then from that you could downvote against questions of that subject matter. This would be because, moreso than your personal hatred for the subject matter, you're voting because you don't believe the question to be valuable to anyone, which is inline with how one should be voting at all times. It shouldn't be &quot;I don't like this&quot;, it should be &quot;This isn't useful to the site&quot;. Typically, subjects that would get identified in this way usually end up being the subject of topicality discussions - if there's a community consensus that a particular subject is toxic to the site, then it makes sense to bar the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not fond of murder and the like either, though I personally stay out of news often just to not dwell on it. So I can understand your dislike of seeing those kinds of questions. However, I don't personally think it's a subject matter that's harmful to the community as a whole to discuss, so I don't feel that downvoting everything is healthy, neither to the community nor to you as a voter. &lt;strong&gt;There is a more applicable course of action for you, though - ignored tags&lt;/strong&gt;. In your profile, there's a tab in the top right that says 'prefs', which you may use to identify one or more tags as &quot;ignored tags&quot;. These will be greyed out when they show up or, if you mark the appropriately labelled &quot;hide ignored tags&quot; checkbox on the same page, hidden altogether from your view as you browse. Using this would let you navigate the site entirely without needing to acknowledge this subject matter, while not inhibiting the abilities of other users to partake in their own millings-about with the topic.

A wealthy carpenter at the top of his trade who was the client of a weak patron had a lower status than a middling carpenter with a strong patron.

The top-voted answer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7907/can-the-new-testament-be-a-valid-historical-record-on-the-real-life-of-jesus&quot;&gt;Can the new testament be a valid historical record on the real life of Jesus?&lt;/a&gt; boils down to: scholars are divided.  There are enough questions about the validity of religious texts that many people dismiss them as historical sources.  Therefore if you ask about events in the New Testament that are not &lt;a href=&quot;http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/4214/3252&quot;&gt;found in other sources&lt;/a&gt;, the only possible answers are opinion-based.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I happen to disagree with that approach.  For one thing, I find &lt;a href=&quot;http://christianity.blogoverflow.com/2012/04/09/easter-as-a-historical-event/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the early Christian writings were based on eyewitness accounts. For another, it's a double standard.  (We accept all sorts of self-serving and politically-motivated documents as having historical value, so why not religiously-biased texts?)  Every bit of historical evidence should have it's day in court and be judged on it's own merits.  Lumping all religious sources into a single blob is, in my opinion, poor (and perhaps, lazy) history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But my opinion is less important than &lt;strong&gt;our opinion&lt;/strong&gt;.  As a group, the consensus is that asking about Jesus is more trouble than it's worth. However, the rephrased question about the economic status of a generic Galilean carpenter, er &lt;a href=&quot;http://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/4896/914&quot;&gt;builder&lt;/a&gt;, under Roman rule can be answered (in theory) without reliance on religious sources.  It's not the choice I would have made, but it seems to be where this site has landed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Different sites have different rules.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can imagine variations on this question being asked on at least four sites:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;History,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://christianity.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Biblical Hermeneutics&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But each site has its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/respect-the-community-your-own-and-others/&quot;&gt;cultural standards&lt;/a&gt;, so the question would need to be asked differently on different sites.  For instance, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/11476289#11476289&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; a regular on Biblical Hermeneutics who told me that the original version would fit there if it included the relevant New Testament references (Matthew 13:55 &amp;amp; Mark 6:3).  It would be harder (but possible, I suspect) to ask on Skeptics and, perhaps, easier to ask on Christianity.  The key is to know your audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it would help if you'd been more careful with terminology, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/771/690&quot;&gt;Mark C.

Take a look at the top five results. If&#xA;your answer is there, then your question would probably have been&#xA;closed as trivial.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Search H:SE. Apparently every month or so someone is compelled to ask a trivial variation about either why the US bombed Japan, or why Africa is poor; these questions are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rickroll&lt;/a&gt; of H:SE.  If you've got a new variation of the question or something new to ask, then explicitly cite the previous question to show that you are aware that the question has been asked before, and make it clear how your question is different.  If you ask a longwinded question that appears to be a duplicate of one of these two, I'm going to downvote.  I probably should feel guilty about this, but to be honest, I don't.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Re-read your question.

Yes, I'm aware that many of you loathe wikipedia with a passion that rivals a divorce settlement or the thirty years war.  If you fall into that group, then provide a citation to some other source, but make it a source that someone can check. The goal in this step is to provide references to clarify your question if it isn't quite as clear in text as it is in your mind.  If you think wikipedia falls short of the goal, then clarify the outstanding issues in your question.    Wikipedia is our crack cocaine - it may be horrible for our health, but the first hit is free, and it just make get one of us hooked on the subject. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Just as a courtesy, if you mention any people, link to that person's page on wikipedia. If you link to a country, a polticial party or any other similar group, link to their page.   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Re-read your question again.  Have you established that you're asking about something real?  Just to pick a random example, does your question assume that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Donation of Constantine&lt;/a&gt; is a genuine document?  If your question relies on false premises, it is unlikely to result in a good question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that failure to do preliminary research is one of the reasons why our &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/q/773/1401&quot;&gt;close question rate is trending in a suboptimal direction.&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also a place where we can make one another excellent.

Enthusiasm and hope don't always translate into something good... Sometimes, the problem is too hard, the goals of each individual too much in conflict with one another, and that initial optimism dies along with any hope of making The Internet a better place for finding good information on a topic.

About &lt;em&gt;computer programming.&lt;/em&gt; The software here allowed for a few things that weren't possible elsewhere, and with them a chance at producing something other than yet another group of misinformed jackasses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions can be edited to clearly state a problem without unnecessary cruft.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Answers are not locked into a fixed chronological order, but can be posted at any time, edited and improved, and elevated based on their &lt;em&gt;usefulness to others&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Threads can be closed &lt;em&gt;and removed&lt;/em&gt; if they become opinion-heavy train-wrecks. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comments are optional, and voting - the means by which useful answers are elevated and misinformed ones are buried - is &lt;strong&gt;strictly anonymous&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/help/behavior&quot;&gt;Civility is required&lt;/a&gt;.

It's not hard to find lousy questions and useless answers on Stack Overflow or any other SE site, and sometimes that ends up being all a site can produce... Sometimes, these beta experiments &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/1062/answers-onstartups-will-close-on-november-12-2013&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;this one&lt;/em&gt; hasn't yet, and doesn't need to.

But if you do stick around - and for the rest of the folks who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; sticking around - I have a few suggestions that might make it a bit less of a painful experience for you...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote! Vote like the outcome of a Chicago election depends on it.&lt;/strong&gt; You think you know what a good question or answer looks like? Then make that known: vote up everything good, &lt;em&gt;and down-vote everything bad.&lt;/em&gt; What's that? You don't think a lazy, unsourced but nominally-correct answer is worth a down-vote? You're afraid of driving away new members by rating their poorly-asked questions honestly? Then you deserve the crap-fest you get as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write the best damn answers you can.&lt;/strong&gt; You can't control what other people do, but when it comes to writing your own answer you have the final say in what it looks like: use  it. Be your own worst critic, and lead by example: if you're concerned about bias and lack of citations elsewhere, make sure your own answers are factual and clearly drawn from reliable sources. Respond to external criticism by going above and beyond to edit in relevant information and present it in a clear writing style. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave concise, factual criticism on misleading answers.&lt;/strong&gt; But &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; get drawn into arguments: say your piece and &lt;em&gt;walk away&lt;/em&gt;. If someone can refute your critique, they're free to do so, but &lt;strong&gt;make it clear by your actions&lt;/strong&gt; that you won't be drawn into pointless debates. By the same token, don't respond to criticisms on your own posts unless you can refute them with facts and without becoming emotional or defensive. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don't Feed The Trolls:&lt;/a&gt; if you observe a particularly inflammatory or nonconstructive comment (on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; post), &lt;strong&gt;flag it&lt;/strong&gt; and move on.

So leaving comments like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1:&lt;/strong&gt; [actual problem goes here]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downvoting&lt;/strong&gt; because...

Instead of leading with the information you most want to communicate, you're starting right off with a distraction - and an implicit invitation for the reader to engage in some tit-for-tat rather than calmly addressing or refuting your criticisms. Even if &lt;em&gt;everything else you write&lt;/em&gt; is constructive and well-reasoned, you're subverting this tone right from the start - &lt;em&gt;stop doing that&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize all this:&lt;/strong&gt; if you're going to participate here, do your best to work with the system, to use the tools given you, and to set an example for others to follow. It's not easy, and there's no guarantee of success, but very little of value in this world comes easily or without effort; if you think this is important, then work to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closing, I'd like to thank you for raising this topic here. Even if you did so in an unnecessarily dramatic fashion, the fact that you decided to take a matter that's been troubling you before the community here rather than passive-aggressively working it into your communication on the site itself speaks to a level of respect for others that, IMHO, would be nice to see more of. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2013-11-13T00:19:37.387" CommentCount="12" />

A good deal arrives at the site via search engines (Google, mostly), which is an important sign of success.  You all should be proud of your progress toward making the internet a better place to learn about history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, this site is on a good trajectory, but there are still things that can be improved given time and some effort.  The easy thing to articulate is that there seem to be about a dozen folks who participate regularly and a 100 or so who participate occasionally.  I suspect that the community would be stronger with more folks providing input on the shape of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harder to address is my concern that the core of this community are not on the same page when it comes to future direction.  Particularly difficult is how much leeway to give askers of controversial questions (religion, politics, verging on bigotry, and potential conspiracy theories).  For better or worse, History is on the Stack Exchange site circuit for people who ask such questions.     The temptation is to tighten the rules so that you don't have to deal with the fallout of such question.  But there's a lot to be said for Mark C. Wallace's &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.history.stackexchange.com/a/801/690&quot;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; of demanding answerable, civil, and researched questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In sum, you all have built a site full of potential that is already helping thousands of visitors a day learn a thing or two about history.  A primary goal should be to invite more people to participate either through personal and professional contacts or by drawing in casual users.

Researcher recognized the iconography of saints, posted links to wikipedia.  The answer wouldn't be any better if the answer were an essay on the history of hagiography or a Chicago style book citation of a book found only in a library. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia provides answers - not ultimate answers, but quite frankly good enough answers - they're in a very sweet spot of cost/benefit/alternatives analysis.  Wikipedia is not a venial sin, it is merely the first/next stop on the journey that you're pursuing through history. Sometimes Wikipedia is enough to foreclose a red herring, sometimes it provides a whole new cluster of terms &amp;amp; connections to research. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;H:SE needs to find the right sweet spot - and in my opinion, that sweet spot is that H:SE provides skilled interpretation.  SE excels at providing the context to permit OP's to leverage existing resources.  H:SE is a little different because we don't have practical problems, but H:SE does provide context &amp;amp; interpretation to permit people to pursue research that they find interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2013-12-20T15:58:40.890" CommentCount="1" />

It has three pretty good answers, but again none have been accepted.

There was only the one answer, it is probably too emotionally worded, and for whatever reason the OQ didn't find it acceptable. I'm giving it the NI purely on the lack of an accepted answer.

I like this question, although it is of a dangerous variety, in that it tempts speculative answers that don't rely on consensus historical opinion. The top answer IMHO succumbed to the temptation.

Just the kind of thing SO sites are needed for. I remember researching this myself, and there really was no straightforward answer to be found on the internet (I know I commented otherwise at the time, but that info really had to be coaxed out). The accepted answer could use some tweaking, but is pretty good. Google found it on the 4th hit. Biggest issue is that there's only the one answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final analysis: The Achilles' heel for the stack here in my evaluation seems to be &lt;strong&gt;questions with no acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;.  I'm kind of hard on this one, because I know when I'm searching and hit other SE sites, I don't find questions without accepted answers very helpful (although sometimes an extreme amount of upvotes will do instead). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases the lack of an accepted answer may simply be due to the questioners not hanging around to maintain their question, but at least a couple of cases appear to be due to no &quot;acceptable&quot; answer being posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="771" LastEditorUserId="771" LastEditDate="2014-01-14T20:37:03.900" LastActivityDate="2014-01-14T20:37:03.900" CommentCount="5" />

There is no evidence of preliminary research, although I must admit that OP must have done some reading in order to conclude that “it seems like England was endless dealing with battles…”.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The entire first page of google is filled with references to SE; there doesn’t seem to be a useful answer in the first two pages of google.  One of the reasons that I suspect this of being a homework question is that this mirrors the kind of oversimplification that was presented to me in middle school; there is undoubtedly truth in the thesis, but demonstrating that thesis requires scholarship and a page count far above SE expectations.  I’m going to reluctantly mark SE superior to the internet on this, entirely due to the efforts of Tom Au to portray complex trends in a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10835/1401&quot;&gt;What is the significance of roof charms outside of the Forbidden City?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Excellent question, because it is somewhat difficult to research without background.  Google reveals a whole bunch of answers that mention the roof charms, but do not explain them. SE answer disclaims strong authority, but provides an introduction. I would have preferred a little more depth.  I’m going to mark this satisfactory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10793/1401&quot;&gt;How did the Dutch East India Company (VOC) have so much revenue when they only control small part of Indonesia?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I’m of two minds about this one; I’m in the middle of listening to “A splendid exchange” by Bernstein. Bernstein provides a clear explanation that would answer the question which is far superior to either of the answers presented. OP asks why VOC was able to make a higher profit than the locals; the simple answer is that the VOC had more capital, and had access to markets where the goods were exponentially more valuable. &#xA;OP asks the question based on reading wikipedia; I infer that OP lacks some of the context/scholarship to understand international trade flows in a partially connected world. Revenue is not proportional to the fraction of Indonesia that the company controls, it is proportional to access to markets and to capital. &#xA;Comparing the SE answers to google, SE is superior, but only because google is utterly inadequate.  The first page of results contains essential the source that OP cites (and if it were sufficient, OP wouldn’t have needed to ask the question) and a bunch of irrelevant material. &#xA;I’m going to have to reluctantly mark this as satisfactory; I want to mark the question “Needs Improvement” because it does, but I have to admit that the answers are superior to google.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/11000/1401v&quot;&gt;Oldest appearance of “brand names” in history?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I don’t like the question; the terms are ill defined. Google provides clear answers for first brand and first trademark, but OP seems to be using the term idiosyncratically.  The fact that I don’t like the question isn’t really relevant; OP managed to communicate the idiosyncratic use successfully and SE provided an acceptable answer.  This is a distinctive value of SE because google is useless to answer a question where the answer depends on interpretation of an idiosyncratic interpretation.  I’ll reluctantly mark this superior.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10898/1401&quot;&gt;Population disparities between New York City and Boston&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;This is a flawed question; OP assumes that the importance of a city has something to do with relative population growth. OP provides no research to support that assumption. I also don't like questions where the title is not a question, but that's just unfair of me.&#xA;Google is not terribly useful; if I were compelled, google does provide tools to restrict searches in time, and I could assemble an answer based on those tools, but it would be time consuming and error prone. &#xA;SE is clearly superior; Pietr Geerkens deserves the plaudits if only for the phrase “the least biased … I could find”.  Because the question is flawed, Mr. Geerkens doesn’t answer it as much as recontextualize the problem. This may be another SE distinctive value.  Again I’m going to reluctantly mark this one as superior, because SE has provided value that the internet can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/10913/1401&quot;&gt;To what extent did the CPC avoid fighting with the Japanese?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I hate questions which include acronyms I have to research before I can understand the question. I ignored this question because I didn’t want to research “what is the CPC” and “What era in history” before I could get into the troublesome problem of inferring the motivation of the parties involved.  Wikipedia says that the CPC did fight a guerilla war against the Japanese. Wikipedia on the Dixie Missions explains why the CPC didn’t fight the Japanese.  That said, OP did cover that research in his question, so I have to shut up and eat crow. I can’t or won’t complain about a question that does preliminary research. &#xA;SE provides no useful answer to the question. the single answer is downvoted; I’m not expert enough in the subject area to judge why.&#xA;I’ll have to mark this “needs improvement”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/q/11010/1401&quot;&gt;What factors led to the 30% devaluation of pound sterling in 1949?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;I’m going to recuse myself from comment on this, since I provided an answer. I will admit that I’m voting this “needs improvement” because there are more parts of the story that are not in the SE answer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's my conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't complain about civility once. That makes me happy. Some of the Q&amp;amp;A were worded strongly, but none of them made my skin crawl. This is a very good thing and makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SE is superior when the questions are bad.  I want all questions to be perfect, but as someone pointed out in meta, perfect questions are very hard.  When the OP lacks context or has erroneous assumptions, SE provides value that other resources can't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my whingeing about the questions, I think they're better than the last crop we evaluated.  Last time I ranted about questions that should have been closed with extreme predjudice. This time there are a couple of questions that I don't like, but only in the &quot;horses for courses&quot; sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only two questions that I rated &quot;needs improvement&quot; probably rely on fairly specialized disciplines of history (fashion history and economic history).

Yet dominance in ice-and-snow sport has siphoned attention from Norway’s initial Olympic engagements that, up to 1924, were summer-only. These reflected an uneasy push-pull dynamic shaped by internal politics, socio-cultural traditions and regional tensions. The nascent Olympic stage gave Norway, which split acrimoniously from Sweden in 1905, needed visibility in an age of ascendant nationalism. However, the elitist early-modern Olympic world also clashed with egalitarian impulses and indigenous traditions that revered idræt, the vigorous but non-competitive pursuit of athletic endeavor. A wider values conflict was telescoped into the Norwegian debate during formative decades, while tensions with Sweden formed a little-known political backdrop to the 1912 Stockholm games. Only from the 1930s could Norway make peace with the Olympic project and forge its Hegelian-like postwar synthesis in which sporting professionalism has eclipsed yet not eradicated traditional idræt  elements. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that sports history is like any topically focused area of historiography.

So let's jump straight to the second:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are a brand new user to History.SE.  Maybe you came from another Stack Exchange site or maybe you found an answer to a question here when using a search engine.  If the site looks good to you on first contact, you might start looking around.  The obvious first place to start is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;active questions page&lt;/a&gt; (which is where you go when you click &quot;History beta&quot; on the upper left of the page). Hopefully there are some interesting questions to read (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10933/has-there-ever-been-a-truly-multi-sided-war&quot;&gt;Has there ever been a truly multi-sided war?&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently highlighted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/stackexchange&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange Facebook account&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a new user will find a few questions that are interesting and maybe be inspired to ask or answer one themselves.  But it's probably more realistic to assume they will be distracted by a cat video someone posted somewhere else.  If they ever come back, it would be helpful to see some fresh content.  New answers on old questions can be helpful there, but the best thing would be a fresh question that the new user is interested in and might answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make a very similar argument for traffic with the big difference that it's Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. who come back to visit the site.  Search engines like fresh content since it's a sign the information is being curated.  New pages (which is what a question represents to the rest of the internet) opens up new search keywords that help people discover the site.  So the rate that new questions are asked correlates with the rate that search engines drive traffic our way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore the very best thing you can do for this site is to find an expert in history who needs an outlet for their writing.  But the &lt;em&gt;next best&lt;/em&gt; thing you can do is &lt;strong&gt;ask a great question&lt;/strong&gt; every now and then.  In many areas of life the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams#Plot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; approach just won't work.  People won't miraculously show up at your cornfield just because you built a ballpark there.  But it can work on Stack Exchange.  If several people decide to ask a question or two a week, you could probably raise the questions per day a noticeable amount.  It might be a temporary effect, but you might catch the next great contributor on History.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;15 questions a day, by the way, isn't a scientifically determined number.  Our current gut instinct (based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday&quot;&gt;existing sites&lt;/a&gt;) is closer to 10 per day.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, which has the most restictions on participation, gets by with about 4 a day.  One of the projects I'm currently working on is figuring out how much extra participation asking questions produces.  I hope that among my findings will be more refined estimates of what question rate signals a healthy site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="690" LastEditorUserId="961" LastEditDate="2014-03-02T00:31:25.250" LastActivityDate="2014-03-02T00:31:25.250" CommentCount="4" />

Yes, it's expanded way, way beyond that, but you have to consider its origins. Personally, I'm a software dev and I got into this site specifically because there's a subsite that deals with my specialty (SharePoint, if you care). Anyway... most people who work in software development have a BS in their field, which required them to take lots of science courses, so one can understand why the sciences are so popular. Additionally, there is a lot of bleedover between software development and fields like mathematics (graphics-based stuff like games in particular can get really, really mathy) and physics, and a lot of scientists have to dabble in programming in order to create the tools they need to run experiments effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the relative popularity of forums like rpg.stackexchange and the science fiction section. Not to get too stereotypical but hey, I'm kind of a nerd myself and I am definitely into at least one and at times two of those things.

This isn't to say that nobody's interested in history, but the cohort that comes to SE to figure out how to add a stack panel on a SharePoint site isn't necessarily going to be heavily into history.

The next temptation is to just delete the thing there, and go on my merry way. However, if you do that often the ensuing comments become senseless. Also, sometimes (particularly if the problem is that post changes have made it obsolete), there's prior comments, or even portions of prior comments, that need to be removed as well. Occasionally it gets so complex that I don't think straightening it out is worth &lt;em&gt;anyone's&lt;/em&gt; time, and I'll just &quot;declare comment bankruptcy&quot; and purge them all. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing all this properly frankly a lot of the time ends up requiring a greater time investment that I really have available when I was just popping in to see if there was any quick maintenance needed. Again, that adds to the temptation to just delete the flagged comment and move on.

It is still closed at this time and still attracted down voters. Please do consider re-opening the poor users question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've never used meta, so please bear with me and I'm not here to criticize anyone. There has been a recent major uptick in the past two weeks I find concerning, since I'm worried it will discourage new users. I went and viewed older posts and the average vote rating for a post has been declining rapidly since about June or July of 2013. I understand you have been trying to improve the post quality and that is an important concern, but I just wanted to express that I really don't think we should be expecting absolute perfection, especially since the rules of Stack Exchange are a bit complex. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, this is most recently posted question&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/12350/how-did-swiss-neutrality-affect-ww2&quot;&gt;How did Swiss neutrality affect WW2?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Was the neutrality of Switzerland during World War 2 a help or hindrance to Hitler?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously if Switzerland had come out on the side of the Axis powers then that would have been beneficial to Hitler. However, if it had entered the war on the side of the Allies, would that have prolonged or shortened WW2 ? Or not made much difference?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main question is I think a very interesting history question and great fit for the site. I welcomed this user, upvoted them, told them we couldn't answer the other portion regarding if Switzerland had entered the war, and referred him to the help center. I thought it was good first question that was workable. This question is on its way to a -2/3 downvote and closed by tomorrow, even with my upvote, because its been happening over and over again lately. Is the opinion that I shouldn't bother with this? I'm a little confused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also as much as I understand down voting rules, there isn't a reason to down vote this question, correct? It is clear and not ugly, it may just be considered off-topic and be closed. By sticking to the rules, the downvoting would probably go down. Two, I've noticed there is a tendency to close questions because we don't know the answer to the question. If we close it then no one else can answer either. It's really hard to decide if you don't know something because you don't know it or it isn't something that is known in general, but I think we can be more mindful.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3682" LastEditorUserId="3682" LastEditDate="2014-04-08T04:31:18.310" LastActivityDate="2014-04-14T00:10:13.797" Title="Nonconstructive amounts of recent down voting/closures" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;close-reasons&gt;&lt;down-votes&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="8" />

I do agree with you though that it can sometimes be helpful if a comment is left explaining the down vote, where appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also agree that the example you gave was a fundamentally good question. It was reasonably unclear in its intention and as originally worded the second paragraph seemed to be asking for speculation rather than fact. Which is why I personally voted to close. I chose not to down vote it because I thought the intent of the question was fine, just that it needed to be re-worded to fit properly.

Unfortunately, I can't find any examples of this at the moment, but I have noticed that in the last couple of months a series of seemingly unanswerable questions have been closed and subsequently deleted. In my book this is a fairly serious problem that we should address. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I broadly agree with what was said by Anver Shahar-Kashtan on the subject, it's my view that closing a question because it might attract the wrong type of answer seems to be taking a bit to far. The voting system we have in place will highlight the bad answers as bad answers for all to see and understand. The truly terrible answers will be flagged and deleted where appropriate and we might, if we are lucky, get a good answer for the question from someone who does know of an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2350" LastActivityDate="2014-04-11T14:03:03.893" CommentCount="0" />

I should not have to read  &lt;em&gt;Sujarkama's Economics&lt;/em&gt; and discover that it relies on the assumption that one of God's holy laws is that all currency should be in the form of comestibles.

I can't find anything on the about page that says whether sources are required. The page does say that questions &quot;asking for references&quot; are discouraged because of a tendency to lead to discussion rather than concrete answers. I do not interpret that as &quot;we should not ask answerers to provide sources.&quot; I interpret it as &quot;don't post questions like 'what's a good book about WWII'&quot; or something like that -- it's likely to lead to a lot of opinion and discussion rather than good answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even then I think it could sometimes be appropriate to ask for reference material here, if the question is narrowly focused and the answer isn't necessarily obvious from basic research.

I haven't been entirely comfortable with the conflict in the comment stream, but I haven't been sure how to address the underlying issues. Your question in meta helped me to clarify those issues and my vision for what I want SE to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Are sources required?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think your summary is absolutely spot on:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is about the philosophy of the site, whether we are going to make it clear that sources are not required. . . &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You assert, &quot;. . . information page for this Stack Exchange site says that sources are not required . .  &quot;. I'm not sure which information page you are looking at; with my tongue in my cheek, I'll point out that it would have been easier to respond to that if you had provided a source.  My best guess is that you're referencing &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer&quot;&gt;Links to external resources are encouraged. . . &quot;&lt;/a&gt;. That is somewhat less conclusive than the way you phrase the admonition, and it appears to be a stock/default phrase on the corresponding page of many help centers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think sources are required; I'd be a hypocrite if I believed that, since several of my answers are unsourced.  I think sources improve almost any answer. I think sources are vital, possibly even critical when addressing contentious topics.  Sources and methods are and essential distinction between history.stackexchange.com and politics.stackexchange.com, or discussion.stackexchange.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that makes history history - is that when we hit a disagreement, we analyze sources to see how strongly they support our arguments. If we don't reference sources, then my opinion is just as good as yours, and we're merely discussing things.  I'm not interested in trading opinions. I think there is ample evidence in the help center that H:SE is intended to be a Q&amp;amp;A site, not a discussion site. There is no way to assess the quality of an opinion.  There are common methods to assess the quality of research and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the core, I think this disagreement originates in the first comment that I saw from you - you said something along the lines that one must deploy logic first, and then seek out evidence; I replied that I thought the obligation was to employ research first, and then test the research against logic. That fundamental disagreement is echoed in your comment to &#xA;@litlnemo above &quot;What people need to do is THINK...&quot;  I think there are contexts in which your approach is appropriate.  I am afraid that I don't think that it is appropriate for H:SE.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You cite Soviet history books as an example of invalid answers - I completely agree with you.  That is precisely why I want to know the sources that inform your answers; I need to be able to critically examine them.  @Anixx has cited Soviet documents to support his answers.  I believe @Anixx has a first rate mind and is a better researcher than I am, but &lt;strong&gt;when he cites Soviet sources&lt;/strong&gt; he applies a different critical frame than I do. I apply a different standard of scrutiny to answers that cite Soviet sources than I do when he cites other sources. The fact that he cites his sources enables me to evaluate the answer.  You don't give me that opportunity - because you don't cite any sources and are hostile to the notion, I have to evaluate all of your answers against a very skeptical standard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've read enough of your answers to know that they are thorough.  The problem is that without sources, I can't tell whether they are trustworthy, accurate or reliable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Self appointed police&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guilty as charged.  As the SE about page states, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/tour&quot;&gt;It's built and run by you . . .&lt;/a&gt;&quot;  We collectively curate this site.  We vote up and down, we comment, we review.  We discuss our shared vision of what the site should be.  I believe that answers with sources are better. I believe that when an answer touches on contentious topics, sources are essential.  When claims are astonishing, sources are essential. If we collectively decide that sources are not required, then I'll back off.  (I think the current guidance is probably good, although if someone were to suggest some language that we could insert specifically on the H:SE page, that encouraged sources, I'd support that)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the crucial point - if the community tells me to shut up and stop demanding sources, I will.

But, what if the question was about the historical conditions in place that allowed 9/11 Truthers to flourish? The same things could be said for a great many other conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the idea is that there are common threads amongst closed questions then I have to disagree. I do not think that closed questions on History share many attributes. Usually questions closed on here are closed because it is not clear what they are asking, or questions are closed because they are objectively outside the realm of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Tyler is on the right track in terms of enthusiasm, but I think that the fact we receive a lot of bad questions, in his estimation, is more due to the general public's lack of interest in formal study/understanding of history. History is often plucked from it's context as a piecemeal solution to arguments. The selective treatment that History receives has more to do with problems surrounding History than any phrasing or constructing of questions that we could capture with a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="579" LastActivityDate="2014-06-10T03:40:03.883" CommentCount="0" />

A distinguished scholar had called the lack of population transfer to resolve the latter conflict unprecedented.  I asked whether it truly is. That set off a firestorm I had not intended.  But one interesting point was made that leads to a more fascinating issue -- if population transfer is a war crime, then, arguably, the resettlement of refugees to end a conflict, as was done in India/Pakistan, and more recently in the former Yugoslavia, as well as following several African tribal and ethnic wars, would be a war crime, too.  Moreover, the Saudi Arabian proposal for peace in Palestine, as well as the aborted proposal at Camp David at the end of Clinton's administration, which would have forced Jews to leave their home, would also be war crimes.  Is the alternative to keep refugees in camps until they have a home to get back to?  Do we force Suni and Shiite neighbors who have been fighting tooth and nail with each other in Iraq to live together whether they like it or not, and whether their countries borders are redrawn creating a situation where they would be forced to live in a hostile environment.  Would the UN and warring nations be barred from redrawing their maps to say &quot;this side is for people of the X and that side is people of the Y&quot; and de facto establishing incentives for the residents to leave homes they and descendants have lived in all of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then it gets interesting when you ask, &quot;how do we determine who are the people who cannot be forced to move?&quot;  Whose law would be used to determine this?

The answer is always the same:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core premise of the StackExchange model is that it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an encyclopedia, meaning there is no editorial board responsible for verifying answers. Instead, the model calls for a site filled with experts (of varying levels of knowledge and fields of expertise) who, through their collective voting, let &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answers rise to the top, and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; answers sink down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important distinction in that last paragraph is the very fluid definition of good and bad answers. Again, this is neither an encyclopedia nor an academic course. The purpose of &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt; is to answer &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt;, and one answer might be more extensively researched and wider in scope, but if people don't feel it answers the original question, or focuses too much on issues that the OP didn't care for, it might get downvoted. An answer with good information but an inappropriate tone might get downvoted by some people, but upvoted by others who don't care about that metric. Some might decide that structuring an answer like an essay, divided into subheadings and paragraphs, might be a good thing and deserve an upvote. Others might see it as unnecessary verbiage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue, closely tied to the first, is that an answer's value to the site is determined collectively. The premise, again, is that a large enough group of experts will, on average, reward good answers and discourage bad ones. The fact that this is &lt;em&gt;collective&lt;/em&gt;, and based on a crowd-sourced system where everyone down- or up-votes based on personal preferences, means that one shouldn't cry foul over every downvote. It means that some people disliked it &lt;em&gt;as an answer&lt;/em&gt;, even though they might be fine with the research in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Factual incorrectness is, of course, always bad and should be discouraged. However, since the standards for voting aren't as stringent as in publishing, &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; information will sometimes be upvoted. Again, this shouldn't be a problem if there are enough downvotes to balance it out. Given enough users, enough experts, enough votes, a downvote or two won't matter to a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's true that History.SE is still a small site, and an answer might languish without getting the attention it deserves, and end up with a negative rank, all votes totaled, when that is entirely undeserved, just because not enough people read it and decided to vote. The solution to that is to popularize the site!

If a quotation was reported in a publication you think has a bias, that doesn't mean it isn't factual.  A &quot;quote&quot; or &quot;fact&quot; in pro-Arab Al Jazeera may be as true or could be as false as one in the pro-Israeli settler Arutz Sheva radio and internet network.  Either's &quot;facts&quot; could be out of context, too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a personal story:  In 1996 I was with my family for my daughter's bat mitzvah in Jerusalem.  During our first days there, there was a lot of Arab publicity about how they were going to build an addition to Al Aqsa Mosque in Solomon's Stables -- which were not neither stables nor Solomon's, but was part of the Herodian Temple complex and should have been excavated by archeologists before any building commenced.  The Waqf -- the Moslem caretakers of the mosque would have nothing to do with archeologists.  Archeologists were demanding something be done, but the government wasn't taking the bait, I though.  They figured that Arafat was looking for a fight, and was looking for an excuse.  Nothing happened that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the day after Yom Kippur we planned to see the Kotel tunnel tour, which at the time was an archeological dig underneath the housing in the Arab quarter adjacent to the Wall of the Temple Mount (aka the Kotel).  From the Kotel plaza, where people pray at the Wall, the tunnel runs directly north in the direction of the Dome of the Rock, but on the other side of the mamouth walls placed there by Herod and are about six feet wide, I'd guess.  No way did we ever go east of the Western Wall.  Impossible.  Until that day, the tunnel patrons had to exit out the same door they entered, at the plaza.  But that day, for the first time ever, an exit into the Arab quarter had been opened and my tour was the first to go out it.  We were told that the city government wanted us to buy from the Arab merchants in the Old City, and also, the exit would solve traffic jams inside the tunnel.  Fine.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were also told, that since we were the first, we would be on television, and should not say anything provocative.  We didn't.  Before we left, we saw a well dressed Palestinian Arab in white clothing come down the exit to inspect us. I never saw or heard of that man again, despite all of the events soon to occur.  On our exit, I saw lots of tv cameras, but never saw myself on television (probably because we were too well behaved -- bad television).  I saw lots of police in riot gear, and all of the Arab shops but one were closed in protest of our exit.   As far as I knew, I was no threat to the Arab people or Palestinian statehood.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We walked from the Arab Quarter to the Jaffa gate and went to the post office to buy stamps to mail postcards.  Just then, I saw cars of riot police heading for the Kotel.  I told my wife that there must be trouble.  When we got to our room, CNN showed Yassir Arafat claiming that my tunnel tour had gone underneath the Al Aqsa mosque (to do so we would have had to have gone to the other side of the six-foot Herodian wall and south and east -- we didn't -- also construction was completed seven years before).  That announcement, apparently, started four days of rioting and heavy casualties.  Today, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_kotel_tunnel_1996.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Palestinian &quot;fact&quot; site&lt;/a&gt; does not attribute the claims of damage to Al Aqsa to Arafat -- although I heard it from his lips when he said it -- and have it has twisted the incident into a claim of an attempt to judaize the Arab quarter -- something that hardly seems worth four days of rioting.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let me turn the question back to you:  given my personal experience, should I trust &quot;Arab propaganda&quot;?  If you quoted that site to me, should I vote it down?  Not everything it said is a lie.  It might only earn two pinnochio noses on the Washington Post fact checker column. And my gut feeling -- that Arafat was looking for an excuse to have a small riot, may not be the correct context, or then again, it might.  Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is much that goes on where we only have half of the facts and context.  It is difficult for any of us on the outside to know what is the whole truth.  It is similarly impossible for those closest to the facts to understand the context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If my house has been destroyed by a missile or members of my family killed, I don't want to hear context.  I don't care.  And whether I'm an Arab or Jewish Palestinian, I'm not going to go on television and discuss the politics or the military reasons or even the depths of international law. All I'm going to do is cry, and maybe even want vengence. And if I'm a reporter at the scene, I'm not going to ask the survivors about that, but I will take video images because death destruction and tears of the grieving make good television.  The truth might not come out, really, but leet those who want the truth wait for 100 years the historians from the eventual winner's side to sit down and figure out which truth suits them best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5179" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T19:12:40.740" CommentCount="0" />

I'm not sure that historical sources and methods would be able to answer whether X is a crime, let alone reason about what hypothetical answer might be a crime.  It might be possible to ask, &quot;What grounds have been used in the past to determine that specific re settlements violate or conform to international law?&quot;  That way we're not trying to decide a question about international law, we're consulting sources to determine if there is an internationally recognized principle or method to reach a determination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question borders on speculation - &quot;If .. arguably... would be&quot;  Those words all cause my downvote finger to twitch.  The scope suggestions of H:SE discourage speculation and hypotheticals.   I'm not entirely sure how to resolve this - I don't know what the question would look like if the speculation were removed.   It might be that &quot;What are the criteria used to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal or not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is an assumption about the nature of crime. If I take your house, that is a crime. If the government takes your house, that is eminent domain and it is entirely legal.  If I force you and your family to resettle, that is a criminal act; if the government forces you to do so, that is a legal act, and any attempt to resist that is illegal.  The situation you describe is a bit more complex because there is no world government (despite the fears of the wingnuts and the ardent desires of the fruitloops).  But if the resettlement is carried out as an attempt by the international community to resolve a dispute, then the action is arguably legal.  Of course I've use the word &lt;em&gt;arguably&lt;/em&gt; (see prior paragraph) and &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; (see first paragraph).  Again, I think the H:SE question probably runs something along the lines of &quot;What criteria has the international community historically accepted to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect the ultimate answer is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mandate of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; - the very pragmatic method of &quot;if it results in good rule, then it must have been the right choice; if it results in chaos and disorder, then obviously it was illegal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not sure that helps, but I thought your question was good enough that it deserved an attempt at an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastActivityDate="2014-08-13T12:25:50.787" CommentCount="1" />

That's a completely different state of being compared to software's beta-testing phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence, these are two entirely distinct terms - do not try to apply logic or experience with software beta testing to Stack Exchange's beta sites, because other than sharing a name and a vague relation to being &quot;preliminary&quot;, they are &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; concepts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, as Yannis Rizos mentions, all of this can be found in our site's &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/help&quot;&gt;Help Center&lt;/a&gt;, which contains, among many other useful tidbits of information, a succinct and precise explanation of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/help/whats-beta&quot;&gt;&quot;beta&quot;&lt;/a&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3121" LastEditorUserId="3121" LastEditDate="2014-08-22T08:16:10.690" LastActivityDate="2014-08-22T08:16:10.690" CommentCount="4" />

I am always glad when someone engages the community and asks how to participate better, and I'm doubly glad when someone asks how to improve a question. I believe that is a vital part of H:SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only offer my personal opinion. &#xA;First, make the title a question. That helps make it very clear what you are asking. &#xA;Second, I think the close reason is incorrect. I agree with you that what you are asking is relatively clear. I don't believe I voted on this; if I had, I would have suggested that it was trivial; as the comments indicate, the answer can be found with a Google search.   The easiest way to improve the question is to do (and document) the preliminary research.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that no matter how you &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; your question, questions that ask &quot;What was the influence of X on Y?&quot; tend to fall into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Homework questions - the teacher/instructor/professor has taught to this question and the student hasn't bothered to do the reading/research/attend the lectures.  These are bad questions for H:SE because &lt;em&gt;as stated&lt;/em&gt; they are really only relevant to that class.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beer and Pretzel questions - someone asked a random question and rather than do any research, they come to H:SE and ask for others to do the work.  These also frequently fall into the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/&quot;&gt;Gorilla vs. Shark&lt;/a&gt;&quot; category of questions where there isn't an answer, there is no meaningful way to reach an answer, there is no agreement on what a good answer would be or how to recognize it, and even if we found an answer, nobody would really care.  This kind of question is excellent for Symposia at the Pub, but very bad for Stack Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of your question, I would first have rephrased it to &quot;What influence did the cold war have on the formation of the internet?&quot;  Then I'd have included some preliminary research. First I've have defined /referenced the two terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Gore created the internet; On 3/9/1999, the internet sprung forth fully formed from his his forehead like Athena from Zeus' skull. The internet is defined as a set of tubes through which pictures of cats flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Stross' Laundry file defines the cold war as the conflict between subterranean extraterrestrial entities and a possessed cat. (sorry for the spoiler). As such the cold war began prior to the beginning of recorded civilization and ended in 2012 at the end of the Laundry Files.  The key features of the cold war are a fixation on exotic mathematics and computer programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(in case the pop culture references aren't obvious, those answers are wrong; no matter how amateur your research, you can do better than those two bullets.) I would have used Google and Wikipedia (and possibly Snopes) to check to see if there are any existing theories about the origin of the internet, and I would have referenced that research in the question so that people don't waste their time searching out the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is also useful to understand why you're asking; what difference does it make if the cold war influenced the internet? If the cold war didn't influence the internet are you looking for what did influence the internet, or are you actually looking for knock on effects of the cold war on the civilian technological base? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1401" LastEditorUserId="1401" LastEditDate="2014-08-24T21:03:48.097" LastActivityDate="2014-08-24T21:03:48.097" CommentCount="3" />

My argument was that from my understanding finding sources is a typical component of the day-to-day of a historian researcher, and that questions of this sort would likely for the most part produce perfectly useful and searchable answers to questions common in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@Semaphore argued that questions like this don't have a definite answer (as mentioned as an argument above), which may indeed correct (though as @RosalindRei points out in the comments in the question above, her case should have a definite answer in the shape of a short list). It might still be worthwhile to remember that this requirement originates from the original stackexchange where sticking to the 1Q&amp;amp;1A format was an important point as there were a lot of different &lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt; floating around with about more or less anything (this programming language versus that, etc.). This may not be so on this board, especially when it comes to listing references.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I am not a historian, I do feel strongly in favour of H:SE being a resource useful to actual researchers in the field. From my experience with Mathoverflow and from talking to historians, I believe our worlds to not be all that different in this respect. Thus I feel I must point out that I have benefited immensely from both reference requests and more open questions on that site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regards to this it may be interesting to note that Mathoverflow solves the problem of open questions (1Q possibly many A) using a big-list tag and making the question community wiki (meaning posts are more freely editable, and that contributors and the asker don't get reputation points). This is not unlikely to produce a number of useful resources here, as it has done there. Further, in opening up this venue H:SE will not immediately deter historians interested in using this site from asking what I believe to be perfectly reasonable questions for a historian to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple examples of useful resources on Mathoverflow stemming from questions with more than one valid answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/100265/not-especially-famous-long-open-problems-which-anyone-can-understand&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/100265/not-especially-famous-long-open-problems-which-anyone-can-understand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-wrong&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478/examples-of-common-false-beliefs-in-mathematics&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478/examples-of-common-false-beliefs-in-mathematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I myself have asked for references on Mathoverflow, where the policies are more in line with what would be useful for a researcher in the field (their policies initially developed independent of the original Stackexchange), and this produced (if several) good answers without having to resort to neither big-list nor community wiki, I'll share that question as well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/68936/source-on-functorial-algebraic-geometry&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/68936/source-on-functorial-algebraic-geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for how to encourage good requests for references and discourage the lower quality questions, I suspect the nature of history as a subject means that this will not generate poor answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I am to propose a change to current policy it may be to allow reference requests, but encourage the asker to be specific to the point where--and maybe present an argument for that--it is feasible a complete answer would consist of a fairly short (and probably slowly expanding) list of reference material.

The first is practical. For example, there's no Anthropology stack right now to direct people to, so closing anthropology questions just for being anthropology helps &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt;. The poor user doesn't get their question answered, and this beta stack has one less question it could sorely use.

(I almost bumped it down for that, but we otherwise covered ourselves in glory here, so I just couldn't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15186/how-much-did-we-know-about-heredity-pre-mendel&quot;&gt;How much did we know about heredity pre-Mendel?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needs Improvement. We were not any of the first 20 hits I got on Google, and that's probably for the best. The question is legit. However, there's only one answer. Its an OK answer. Not sparkling, but OK. It could really use some competition. The google hits I got were full of really good information (along with the exact question on ask.com, with its typical horrible answer). We can do better here. This was also the first of the example questions I was unfamiliar with, so perhaps a lot of that is my bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15111/when-did-japan-and-the-three-kingdoms-of-korea-first-meet&quot;&gt;When did Japan and the Three Kingdoms of Korea first meet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excellent. Wonderful question. Showed its research and where that research failed. Certainly not trivially googleable. Great (although again way too long) answer. Could use another answer, but then in this case perhaps the accepted one is right, so no other answer really needs to be created. I was on the fence about this one, but I'm marking it up to &quot;excellent&quot; because I don't think you can find better on the internet at large without doing a lot of research yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15113/which-countries-protested-against-the-anschluss&quot;&gt;Which countries protested against the Anschluss?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needs Improvement. The problem here is that the question is really squishy (as the one answer rightly pointed out). The answer is no better though, as it presents novel (to me) information with no backup whatsoever. This was pointed out in the comments, but never rectified. Disappointing all around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15210/what-book-on-liberty-did-lord-acton-not-write&quot;&gt;What book on liberty did Lord Acton not write?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excellent - The question looks weird at first blush, but is fair enough. I'm not sure how to go about Googling for it. On the plus side, it has two answers, one of which appears to be 100% correct and very well written. I even upvoted it at the time. Sadly, the other answer was clearly written by a total buffoon, and should probably have been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do know that you can't easily find the answer outside of our site, because I tried and failed miserably. :-) So I think despite having only one good answer, and that other blemish upon the face of our stack there, I'm marking this excellent as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15069/pre-ww2-location-of-skalat&quot;&gt;Pre-WW2 location of Skalat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory - The question is the weakness here, as it turned out to have the answer right there in the wikipedia page. However, the answer is great, in that it points this out and distills the important info from that page nicely. There's no other answer, but there really doesn't need to be. We were the second hit I got on Google (the first being the wikipedia page in question).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/15191/what-wiped-the-buddhism-traces-from-kerala-history&quot;&gt;What wiped the Buddhism traces from Kerala History?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory - The question was probably the weakness here too, in that I found the answer explicitly stated right in the Wikipedia entry I got from my first Google hit. Our answers didn't make Google's first page of hits, and neither was accepted. Both answers themselves look pretty good to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14984/panda-source-analysis&quot;&gt;PANDA Source Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needs Improvement. I'm not saying its horrible. Its just that the answer has not been accepted, and could probably use some more attention. As I mentioned in the comments, the nature of the question makes it ungooglable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In aggregate, this is the best site-eval I've returned for this stack yet, by far.

Perhaps - in so far as we possess the arrogance to speak for all historians - not answerable by &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; historian with current sources, tools and absence of a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance: &lt;em&gt;&quot;How much of the annual budget of Pharaoh Khufu's regime was allocated to tomb building?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can answer these as unanswerable or close them as unanswerable; but we run up against problems either way&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

If we close them as unanswerable; we don't allow for someone knowing the answer, partial answers, duplicate unanswerables with the better content&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or incentivising people to explain authoritatively why it's unanswerable&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you have what I call the &quot;zero or many&quot; question:answer paradox. These are questions where a quantifiable answer exists but it's either zero or many answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Was there a king that had seven legitimate sons?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a paradox in so far that instead providing &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(no answer - implicit)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(no answer - explicit)&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt; answers &lt;em&gt;(subset of known or knowable answers)&lt;/em&gt;, the question is closed as too broad or opinion based because it didn't resolve to precisely one answer.

That caused the migration to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt;, which means the original post here on History should be back to normal again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As already noted, one of the site moderators here moved the questions in response to several comments and flags requesting migration. The questions were, in fact, both on-topic at HSM, so there was nothing wrong with migration when looked at in isolation. I decided to reverse the migrations this one time to prevent them from becoming the start of a constant stream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for the &quot;why&quot; of it all. The default action on any question should pretty much always have something to do with answers, whether it's reading answers or writing an answer. Only when something goes wrong should anyone start thinking about voting to close. That means that if a question is on-topic for History, it should probably stay at History, even if it's also on-topic at another site. This is especially true when a question is old, and/or already has answers, and/or predates the potential migration target site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As T.E.D. mentioned, HSM is a &quot;proper subset&quot; of History, so cases like this are probably going to come up a lot, going forward.

I would argue there needs to be a balance and also allow for some noise to facilitate new and existing users engaged and if someone seems like they put some effort into looking into it and not just drunkingly fired off a question because they saw something on History channel and was wondering more about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think questions looking for an archival repository or source material that the questioner can then further research is useful if it is adequately scoped and specialized enough it would not be all over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I think questions about how someone would determine something are similar are also technically reference/resource method questions and should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for example and sake of discussion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A) &lt;code&gt;How would I determine the people from Kent that participated in WWII?&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or do they need to specifically ask how many people from Kent were part of an armored division?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B) &lt;code&gt;How would I go about determining the daily supplies consumed by the 3rd Armored Division during WWII?&lt;/code&gt; or would someone need to answer a more specific question like from September 2nd to September 15th, 1944 around the Battle of the Bulge? &lt;em&gt;(Yes the dates are not fully inclusive, but that is part of the point)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C) &lt;code&gt;Where can I find WWII AXIS prisoner lists captured by allied forces in the X region?&lt;/code&gt; or does someone need to know who they are looking for or ask like how many officers were captured in the question so it is specific and not a reference question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In A-C you are enabling the quester, where as the alternative versions the one answering is basically becoming the researcher on behalf of the question taker if it is something that may take extensive research to compile or answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first 12 hours of actively trying to participate in this forum I have seen a lot of opinion and editorial comments which do not contribute to the answer or help refine the question.

This shouldn't be surprising, as the study of History is all about reading and analyzing references. Unfortunately, the StackExchange system is not well designed for this type of question, so these often get closed, as much as many users here would like to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some stacks allow questions like this, but an examination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/book-recommendation&quot;&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; show that the content doesn't end up being very useful (low votes, seemingly capricious acceptances). What is needed is a way within the system to set up such questions in a way that does encourage the production of useful content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed Reference List Question process, when a question that qualifies as a request for a list of references or books is submitted by a user, the following will happen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; notices the nature of the question, and adds the tag &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/references&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'references'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone creates a community wiki answer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Someone adds a comment to the question giving the questioner the option of either accepting the community wiki answer, or having the question held until they can rephrase it to no longer qualify as a list of references. The comment should reference this meta post for a fuller explanation to the original poster.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who wish to answer at this point may do so (with normal non-wiki answers). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any references listed in a new answer will also be added to the accepted wiki answer by someone (preferably the person who posted the answer), with no commentary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 -&quot;Someone&quot;, in true StackExchange fashion, means any user who happens to notice that it needs doing and has the requisite reputation to perform this action. Users who notice and &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have the needed reputation may flag the item to request it get done.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advantages of this approach: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The compilation wiki answer puts the complete list of mentioned references at the top of the answers (regardless of voting activity). Being a wiki, no user will get reputation credit for it, as is right for a compilation of everyone's answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other answers, all sharing the property of not being accepted, will be automatically sorted via the voting process. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who post answers will get reputation credit for the quality of their answers as per normal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A random web surfer hitting our page should find first the question, second a complete list of references, and following that answers with references and explanations, sorted by quality (votes).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, I believe it sets up a system where the existing SE engine will provide the proper incentive for good useful answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It requires an extra step from the person asking the question. Often such people are brand-new users who are likely to have more trouble than most comprehending jargon like &quot;accept button&quot; and &quot;wiki answer&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It requires extra moderation work from alert and knowledgeable users.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't solve the fundamental issue of such questions being solicitations of personal opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Its a big experiment.

There's going to be a mad race to be &quot;first&quot; when someone asks for recommendations about the Roman Empire, because answering &quot;Edward Gibbon&quot; might net you 400 easy points. But even after all of the big names are taken, some users will be incentivized to search Amazon for a book on Rome that hasn't made the list yet, and they'll add it hoping to get a few easy upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is contradictory of me because I think the reputation system, though not perfect, generally creates healthy incentives for SE. I think that's because normally, the quality of our answers themselves is being judged--wanting an extra upvote pushes you to do extra research, extra proofing, extra thinking. But for book recommendations, the referent of our answers is being judged. You can't write a better answer (Edward Gibbon is already as good as he is going to get), so wanting an extra upvote pushes you to post additional recommendations. So I both worry that signal will get lost in the noise, and that some of these threads will become de facto pinned to the top of &quot;active questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only way to take reputation out of the equation would be to force all OPs to make their questions community wikis (which forces all answers to be community wikis) or to host these questions in Meta.

Particularly the non-Greek stuff I don't know as much about. So there's that. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="771" LastActivityDate="2015-03-03T15:38:34.973" CommentCount="0" />

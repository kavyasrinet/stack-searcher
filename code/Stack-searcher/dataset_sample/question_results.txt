25	What are the best ways to avoid data roaming fees when travelling abroad?	<p>I'm looking for data plans I can use while touring different countries within a region without having to worry about being eaten by roaming fees. If such plans exist at all, I suppose mostly big telecommunication providers like Vodafone or T-Mobile will offer them.</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
185	Is there a list of free accomodation resources?	<p>I want to travel abroad cheap, and I would prefer to find some place to stay through a person or website, rather than book a hotel or hostel. There is <a href="http://couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a>, which I know about. Can you recommend other resources where I can find free accomodation?</p> 
105	How can I travel between US towns without flying	<p>Can you help me decide, what type of transport can I use to travel from one US town to another (it will be a big journey), without flying?</p>  <p>Are buses available, and is there any more suitable method of traveling?</p>

11	What is the best way to obtain visas for the Trans-Siberian/Trans-Mongolian Railway?	<p>I'm planning on taking the trans-Siberian / trans-Mongolian from Moscow to Beijing via Ulaan Bataar next year and I'd like some advice on how best to organise the visa situation. </p>  <p>I'm a British citizen, partner is Swedish. We'll need visas for Russia, China and Mongolia. Seeing as you can only book the train tickets like 3 months in advance and you need to get all the visas together in that time as well, the process seems likely to be a bit complicated. Especially if you end up getting declined for a visa. </p>  <p>What is the best process or method for obtaining the visas (in which country order) and is there any kind of trustworthy service that will do it for me? If I go through a service, what happens if one of my visas is declined?</p> 
289	Is the border between Georgia and Russia open to citizens of other countries?	<p>I know the one border between the Republic of Georgia and Russia that is not in a rebel province was officially opened in the last couple of years... but reports are conflicting as to whether people not from ex CIS countries can cross.</p>  <p>So can somebody please confirm one way or another, is the border between Georgia and Russia open for travellers?</p>

442	When travelling overland in Russia I hear you must register with the police in each new place, but does this cost money?	<p>When travelling overland in Russia (i.e. not on the Trans-Siberian) I hear you must register with the police in each new place, but does this cost money?</p>  <p>I know there are some gotchas with registering with the police when travelling in Russia but is there a fee or are bribes common when registering? And what about getting caught without registering? Also is there a minimum time I must spend in a place before registering must be done?</p>

441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
193	Overlanding without a Carnet de Passage?	<p>There's a lot of (sometimes contradictory) information to be found around the internet about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnet_de_Passage">Carnet de Passage</a>. The linked Wikipedia article, for instance says that</p>  <blockquote>   <p>a Carnet de Passage is required in Burundi, Egypt, Kenya, Libya, Senegal (for vehicles older than 5 years), Southern African Customs Union (BW/NA/LS/SZ/ZA), Sudan, Uganda.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Well, last year, I've been doing some overland traveling with a friend and we drove a 15 year old car without Carnet de Passage (besides through Europe) through Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. And I can tell for sure that the only country which was kind of problematic (but not even impossible) to enter without a Carnet was Egypt.</p>  <p>We had to actually buy a local Carnet which was only valid in Egypt and costed us around 500€. All in all it was much cheaper for us to travel without a Carnet as the cash bond of 5000€ (which is the minimum in Europe) was much higher than all the money we spend on the car, including the purchase and all temporary import taxes we had to pay at the different borders (we knew in advance we wouldn't bring the car back home).</p>  <p>From other overlanders we met, we heard that the only countries in the world that are kind of "problematic" concerning a Carnet de Passage are Egypt and Iran.</p>  <p>I've been thoroughly searching for this info before we left, and I could only conclude that the only possibility to know for sure was to just show up at the border and hope for the best.</p>  <p>With this question I would like to gather real-life, hands-on experiences with overlanding without a Carnet de Passage, with the ultimate intent to create a trustworthy reference so future overlanders don't have to hunt around the internet to only find contradictory information and in the end buy themselves a Carnet de Passage while it wasn't really necessary.</p> 
349	How to overcome the language barrier when visiting France and Spain?	<p>I may be traveling to France and Spain for business purposes, and I'm likely to mix some pleasure with that business trip.</p>  <p>I do not expect many language issues during the business conversations.</p>  <p>However, when I go out sightseeing or touring the countryside, I'm sure I will encounter the language barrier as I do not speak French or Spanish.</p>  <p>I do not think I have enough time to learn much more than a few basic phrases.</p>  <p>What translation tools could I use to communicate with the locals when traveling through the French and Spanish countrysides?</p> 
426	Third party shore-excursion operators in the Western Caribbean	<p>Cruise ships usually offer shore excursions that can be booked for an additional fee.  These can be more expensive than going with a 3rd party, since the cruise line takes a cut.  Is there a list of companies offering shore excursions in the Western Caribbean?  Anyone have experience with a tour operator in particular in this region?</p> 
755	Are there ferry companies that visit the Norwegian fjords?	<p>I'm interested in visiting Norway's fjords via a round-trip ferry out of Oslo. Are there companies that do this?</p> 
763	How to see the Norwegian fjords?	<p>I am currently working in The Hague area of the Netherlands. This summer is too cold to spend weekends on the beach, so I've decided to spend 3-4 days seeing the Norwegian fjords instead. </p>  <p>I understand there are three possibilities:</p>  <ol> <li>Find a ship starting from Amsterdam that goes to the fjords and back.</li> <li>Go to one of the fjords and rent a house for 2-3 days.</li> <li>Go to Oslo or another Norwegian city, stay there, and take a bus trip to the fjords.</li> </ol>  <p>Which is the cheapest, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?</p>  <p>As for now - the most desired for me is 2. I checked the prices for flights - and Oslo is 3 times cheaper from Amsterdam then Trondheim. Do you know if there is a possibility to rent a house on the fjord close to Oslo?</p> 
484	Visa for European countries for US passport holder	<p>I'm a US passport holder. What documents do I need when I fly from the U.S. to Germany?  Assume I'm going for a few weeks of vacation.  Obviously I need my <strong>passport</strong>.  What about a "<strong>visa</strong>"?  Anything else?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
780	Buying Paris metro tickets from Eurostar before/during the journey?	<p>Whenever a Eurostar gets into Brussels, and especially when one gets into Paris, there is always a mad scramble for the metro ticket machines, and if you weren't in the first coach then a very long queue...</p>  <p>A couple of years ago I did manage to buy Paris metro tickets from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostar">Eurostar</a> information desk in London before I left, as described <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm">here</a>. (It was at the information desk on the far right after security and passport checks). I seem to recall they even sold me the tickets in sterling at the day's exchange rate!</p>  <p>I've subsequently recommended this to a friend, who wasn't able to buy the tickets from the information desk, and instead had the long queue at the metro ticket machines on arrival.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if Eurostar are still normally selling metro tickets from the information counter? And/or does the buffet on board sell them? (I think I've once heard an announcement about that)</p> 
886	Paris Gare du Nord to Gare Montparnasse, by public transport but without lots of walking?	<p>In a couple of weeks time, I'm off to the Loire by Eurostar + TGV, which means a cross Paris change. The Eurostar uses Gare du Nord, while the TGVs down to the Loire are at Gare Montparnasse.</p>  <p>One option is to take a taxi, but that looks to be around the <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm#taxi">€30 mark</a>. </p>  <p>There is a direct metro line linking the two stations, M4, which would seem to be a great bet. Unfortunately, the metro station isn't really at Gare Montparnasse, but is instead <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm#Metro%20routes%20from">a 750m+ walk</a> with lots of stairs. With a load of luggage, that's not looking much fun...</p>  <p>If I want to do the transfer by public transport, is that my only bet? Or is there another route (perhaps by bus?) that'll let me get from one station to the other by public transport, but without lots of walking?</p>

877	How long does it take to renew a US passport?	<p>For US citizens living in the United States, how long does it typically take (from start to finish) to renew a US passport? If the expedited fee is paid, how fast can it be done?</p>

448	Are there cheap GPS or other navigator devices with downloadable maps for the whole world?	<p>I don't need a recommendation or a list but my knowledge of GPS and "navi"s and the differences between them is an utter mystery to me.</p>  <p>But often I'm lost in backstreets in random countries where access to something like a live Google Maps would be awesome. I absolutely cannot afford a smartphone with worldwide roaming though.</p>  <p>Can GPS's do what I want or am I barking up the wrong tree? If they can is it only high end ones than can?</p> 
529	Is it possible to go directly from Siem Reap to Vientiane over land?	<p>I'm planning on going to Vietiane in Laos, but I wanted to cross over land from Cambodia. Are there direct bus connections from Siem Reap to Vientiane, and if so, how long does the journey take? I have heard conflicting reports - some say yes, some say there's no way around it but to double back to Phnom Penh and catch a bus from there to Vientiane, which doesn't make sense at all to me. Or, if not a direct bus from Siem Reap, then is it possible to get to Stung Treng checkpoint by local bus, then connect to Vientiane from there? (If not bus, boats / ferries are acceptable too.)</p>  <p>I have also heard that even though the official Lao immigration site says visa-on-arrival is available at land border checkpoints, they have stopped issuing them at Stung Treng and require visitors to get a visa beforehand. Is that true?</p> 
1063	Is it possible to visit Abkhazia by land from Georgia?	<p>Is it possible currently (November 2011) to visit the rebel province of Abkhazia from the rest of the Republic of Georgia? (Russia regards it as independent since 2008 but most or all other countries regard it as still part of Georgia)</p>  <p>I had heard that it was not allowed by the Georgian government and that soldiers would actively prevent anyone trying to do so.</p>  <p>But that was a while ago and things can and do change quickly and this is not a part of the world where such news quickly becomes known in western countries.</p>  <p>So can I now enter from Georgia and if so what kind of visa/permit would be needed?</p>  <p>If not I assume I can visit from Russia with of course a Russian visa but would I need any other kind of paperwork. And would Georgia let me back in with an Abkhazia stamp in my passport?</p>  <p>(See also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1064/is-it-possible-to-visit-south-ossetia">my similar but not identical question about South Ossetia</a>)</p>  <p><strong>PS</strong></p>  <p>I'm not asking about whether any western country issues travel advisories asking me not to visit.

1064	Is it possible for a tourist to visit South Ossetia?	<p>South Ossetia is a rebel provice of the Republic of Georgia recognized and supported by Russia as an independent state since 2008 but recognized by most countries in the world as part of the Republic of Georgia.</p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1063/can-i-visit-abkhazia-from-the-republic-of-georgia">Last I heard the situation was a bit different to that in Abkhazia which I believe can be visited somehow.</a></p>  <p>I heard that in the case of South Ossetia you cannot visit from Russia (North Ossetia) unless you are a citizen of a CIS country, and that you cannot visit from Georgia at all.</p>  <p>Is this still the case in November 2011? Can I visit as foreign tourist either from Georgia or Russia and if so what visas/permits/paperwork will I need? If I can visit from Russia but not from Georgia will I have trouble subsequently visiting Georgia with a South Ossetia passport stamp?</p>  <p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>  <p>I'm not asking about whether any western country issues travel advisories asking me not to visit.

823	Which chateaux of the Loire are worth visiting?	<p>When visiting France, one of the great things to see are the Chateaux of the Loire Valley. An hour by TGV from Paris, yet a world apart, with stunning grand palatial castles in beautiful scenery, it's certainly somewhere to visit.</p>  <p>If you check most guidebooks, they all seem to agree on two Chateaux to visit. Firstly there's the Château de Chambord, an impressive Renaissance masterpiece that's the largest of the Loire Chateau.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QNc9P.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:France_Loir-et-Cher_Chambord_Chateau_03.jpg"></p>  <p>The other that everyone seems to agree on is the Château de Chenonceau. While smaller, the rooms, tapestries, furniture and artworks are stunning, and you visit as much for the contents as the building itself. There are some very nice gardens too.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nky8B.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chateau_de_Chenonceau_2008E.jpg"></p>  <p>Having visited these two last year (along with a couple of others), I'm keen to see a few more this year. The problem is that most guidebooks either seem to stop after just a few, or go on to list several hundred, without the middle ground.</p>  <p>My question therefore is what other Chateaux of the mid Loire (roughly Angers to Tours)  should one try to see (beyond the obvious two of Chenonceau and Chambord), and why?</p>

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

1709	Does the Ukraine-Georgia ferry go via Russia and if so must I have a Russian visa even if I don't disembark?	<p>Previously we had a question about <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/921/ferry-connection-between-crimea-ukraine-and-georgia">ferries between Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia</a>. The answer was that the company <a href="http://www.ukrferry.com/eng/shipping/schedule-ports.php" rel="nofollow">UkrFerry</a> has such a route but I'm unsure of the details and the site seems to be mostly in Russian.</p>  <p>What I'm wondering is if the ferry goes via Russia and if so is it possible to travel say from Kerch to Poti without the need to obtain a Russian visa? (Impossible for me anyway since I would have to apply in Australia and I'm already in Europe).</p>

248	Avoiding air travel sickness without Dramamine/Dimenhydrinate or other drugs	<p>My wife is very prone to motion sickness, especially on air flights.  In the past we've handled this with Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate), which helped quite a bit.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, my wife's reaction to the Dramamine was invariably to fall into a deep, groggy sleep for the duration of the flight.  This is her reaction to most antihistamines. </p>  <p>We're planning on taking a trip to Europe next year, and I'm concerned about the idea of essentially drugging her into unconsciousness for the duration of an extended overseas flight.</p>  <p>Is there any other recourse to prevent motion sickness that would be effective for a long haul (7+ hours) flight?</p>

1833	Is there a hotel / B&B Finder using Google or Bing maps?	<p>I'm looking for a good site that lists Hotels and B&amp;B on top of Google Maps or Bing Maps. That has tool tips with prices and availability.</p>  <p>What is the best site of this kind?</p> 
1304	Is there wifi in Astana Airport (Kazakhstan)?	<p>I have several hours stopover there tomorrow night. I'm debating sleeping in the airport or sleeping in a hotel - I can sleep anywhere, but if there's wifi in the airport that would seal the deal for me :D  </p>  <p>However I can't seem to find out definitively if there is wifi in the airport - free or not - the wiki article is rather sparse.</p> 
1340	Where is wild camping possible in Europe?	<p>Are there countries in Europe where wild camping with a tent allowed or at least tolerated? How high is the probability that someone will get angry at you or even call the police? </p>  <p>Please consider only cases where the travellers would be using common sense - not making noise, leaving no trace behind, staying out of sight of roads and houses, etc. In our case, the tent is small and easy to hide (dark green) and we won't need a camp fire.</p>

11	What is the best way to obtain visas for the Trans-Siberian/Trans-Mongolian Railway?	<p>I'm planning on taking the trans-Siberian / trans-Mongolian from Moscow to Beijing via Ulaan Bataar next year and I'd like some advice on how best to organise the visa situation. </p>  <p>I'm a British citizen, partner is Swedish. We'll need visas for Russia, China and Mongolia. Seeing as you can only book the train tickets like 3 months in advance and you need to get all the visas together in that time as well, the process seems likely to be a bit complicated. Especially if you end up getting declined for a visa. </p>  <p>What is the best process or method for obtaining the visas (in which country order) and is there any kind of trustworthy service that will do it for me? If I go through a service, what happens if one of my visas is declined?</p> 
292	Are there any ferries currently running on the Black Sea between Romania and the Republic of Georgia?	<p>I plan to visit Romania and the Republic of Georgia this year and would love to consider the possibility of travelling between them on the Black Sea. I know both countries have various ports and have or have previously had various ferries or other types of sea travel on the Black Sea.</p>  <p>But regular web searches return a lot of out-of-date information and I feel the current information may be concealed in a variety of uncommon languages.</p>  <p>So, is it possible in 2011 to travel from Romania To Batumi or Poti in Georgia on the Black Sea? If so, what companies, times, and prices?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
1628	Are there any problems crossing Kosovo's international borders or having their stamp in your passport?	<p>I'm thinking of heading from Romania to Serbia to Albania, possibly via Kosovo (on an Australian passport).</p>  <p>Since Kosovo becoming a country wasn't unanimously popular in the region I'm a bit concerned that Serbia or Albania might not fully approve of me visiting Kosovo. Are there any border crossing difficulties for tourists, or will having a Kosovo stamp in my passport cause issues when entering neighbouring countries? (Do all Kosovo's neighbours even recognize Kosovo?)</p>

289	Is the border between Georgia and Russia open to citizens of other countries?	<p>I know the one border between the Republic of Georgia and Russia that is not in a rebel province was officially opened in the last couple of years... but reports are conflicting as to whether people not from ex CIS countries can cross.</p>  <p>So can somebody please confirm one way or another, is the border between Georgia and Russia open for travellers?</p> 
2067	Is it possible to get a train from Georgia to Moscow?	<p>I am thinking of doing a road trip to Georgia, dumping my car there then travelling to Moscow, to continue on the Trans-Siberian to Beijing.

1869	How do I ensure I do not pay out money for tickets that are not usable for other reasons?	<p>For the first time I am trying to organise an extended individual journey - 6-10 months and 10-14 countries. Although I am intending to be an independent traveller and organising travel arrangements as I go; I need to sort out tickets and visas for the first part of my journey - by train from Cambridge to Northern China.</p>  <p>All the advice I have found so far recommends purchasing the tickets for the Trans-Mongolian train first, and then applying for the visas. There is no guarantee that I will obtain either the visas I want, nor that I will get them for the duration I want.</p>  <p>What is a suitable approach in purchasing tickets and applying for visas; to ensure that in the event of visas being limited or even refused, the money spent on tickets is not lost. I am not sure if one can obtain refundable tickets, or insurance that covers such a situation, or whether there is some other option.</p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11/what-is-the-best-way-to-obtain-visas-for-the-trans-siberian-trans-mongolian-railw">This question</a> does provide some useful information and advice.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>Additional information in the light of comments:</p>  <ol> <li>I am investigating specialist agencies now.</li> <li>I am primarily concerned with the Chinese visa. My concerns about this visa are to do with duration and remoteness. I would like to be in China for three months (longer if possible). During this time I want (on only one occasion) to visit the TAR. This requires four special permits; can only be done as part as an organised tour; and involves a specific allocated block of time (of up to 21 days). Even when I am not in the TAR, I will be in remote areas where travel, to and from the nearest PSB office that can issue visa extensions, can take three or four days each way. I understand that Chinese tourist visas now are only for 30 days, with an extension possible to another 30 days. </li> </ol>  <p>In the circumstances I am not sure I will be able to get the visa and permits I want; and even if I do that I may not be able to get visas to cover the duration of what I want to do. </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>In the event I was able to get the visa I wanted - a 90 day tourist visa - so the question of refunds on rail tickets did not arise. None of this experience reduced the usefulness of the answers received on this question.</p>  <p><strong>END UPDATE</strong></p>

1063	Is it possible to visit Abkhazia by land from Georgia?	<p>Is it possible currently (November 2011) to visit the rebel province of Abkhazia from the rest of the Republic of Georgia? (Russia regards it as independent since 2008 but most or all other countries regard it as still part of Georgia)</p>  <p>I had heard that it was not allowed by the Georgian government and that soldiers would actively prevent anyone trying to do so.</p>  <p>But that was a while ago and things can and do change quickly and this is not a part of the world where such news quickly becomes known in western countries.</p>  <p>So can I now enter from Georgia and if so what kind of visa/permit would be needed?</p>  <p>If not I assume I can visit from Russia with of course a Russian visa but would I need any other kind of paperwork. And would Georgia let me back in with an Abkhazia stamp in my passport?</p>  <p>(See also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1064/is-it-possible-to-visit-south-ossetia">my similar but not identical question about South Ossetia</a>)</p>  <p><strong>PS</strong></p>  <p>I'm not asking about whether any western country issues travel advisories asking me not to visit.

1980	Las Vegas - What is good to do there?	<p>I've been told that unless you have a good plan for Las Vegas, you're not going to have a clue what to do when you get there.</p>  <p>I and my two brothers have a trip planned in October from the 2nd to the 16th. We're starting in Los Angeles and then driving to Vegas. We have things planned for Los Angeles so that part is fine. However, we're planning to stay longer in the Vegas area.</p>  <p>So far we have a single casino visit planned, tickets to see <em>Penn and Teller</em> and time at a gun range sorted. But we plan to be there from the 5th to the 14th so we need more to do.</p>  <p>This is a once in a lifetime trip for us and we don't want it to be too much of a tourist thing. We're looking to find some good places to head out and have fun. We're all in our twenties (24-28) and Irish, so somewhere we can get drunk would be great.</p>  <p>Top ideas or good tips for hanging out in Vegas would be greatly appreciated.</p> 
1504	Will an Iranian or Kuwaiti visa or stamp in my passport pose a problem on a future visit to Israel?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1497/are-there-any-repercussions-from-having-an-israeli-stamp-in-my-passport">this question I learned that entering Kuwait with an Israeli stamp in your passport will be a problem</a>. (Less surprising was that Iran doesn't like them either).</p>  <p>Later during my current trip I am hoping to visit Kuwait via Iran and I certainly intend to visit Israel at some point in the future.</p>  <p>Since these issues are often but not always reciprocal I would like to know if the Kuwait stamp will be a problem when visiting Israel or if they are less fussy than the reverse.</p>  <p>I'm expecting that the Iran stamp will definitely be a problem for an Israel visit but I'd be glad to be proven wrong.</p> 
2049	Can Serbian dinars be exchanged in the Republic of Macedonia?	<p>I just crossed the border from Serbia to the Republic of Macedonia and was surprised that the currency exchange booth on the Macedonian side accepted Euros but not Serbian dinar.  </p>  <p>Generally I've found even in places that are not very friendly at least at the border it's possible to exchange money if not elsewhere.  </p>  <p>Does this mean that I won't be able to change my Serbian money for Macedonian money? I didn't expect Macedonia to be on unfriendly terms with Serbia.  </p> 
2287	Where can a middle-aged couple move for a couple of years working holiday and travel base?	<p>I'll try to be specific so that this question is not too open ended and can be answered.</p>  <p>We are vaguely dreaming about moving to a different country to work for several years.  Most destinations are a long way from Australia so we would like to live and work in another country to experience that country and as a travel base to nearby countries.</p>  <p>Some facts about us to make this question specific:</p>  <ul> <li>We are too old (40) for student working visas</li> <li>I have skills in IT/finance and she has skills in hospitality/real estate</li> <li>We speak only English (while willing to learn some local language realistically we would need to be speaking English in the workplace)</li> <li>We would be looking at staying for 2 or 3 years if this is possible</li> <li>Could take a pay-cut compared to Australian incomes so long as we have enough money to live on</li> <li>We are both Australian citizens only (no dual citizenship avenues)</li> <li>It's possible that only one of us needs to work and the other could volunteer</li> <li>We have travelled in East Africa and India/Nepal</li> </ul>  <p>About possible destinations:-</p>  <ul> <li>Developing world would be good (and not say, US, UK, Canada, NZ)</li> <li>A warm place would be better than somewhere cold</li> <li>Location should be a good travel base for the nearby region</li> <li>Obviously we would need to be eligible for a working visa</li> </ul>  <p>What are the options?</p> 
805	Travel insurance with a pre-existing condition	<p>I have ulcerative collitis. It's not particularly bad. I'm trying to get travel insurance for two different holidays (one to the US and one to China/Japan).

1805	Cheap short-term accommodation in downtown Vancouver	<p>I'm trying to get a working holiday visa for Canada, but it's proving problematic for a variety of reasons.  However whether I end up staying for a year or not, I'll likely be heading to Vancouver for at least a week in the next month or two.</p>  <p>I've looked up hostels and airbnb, but am not finding that many in downtown - and the suburbs mean little to me, as I don't know the city.  Any suggestions, websites, hostels or otherwise in a good central location for a reasonable price?</p> 
2044	What type of mosquito repellent is most effective?	<p>There are many different kinds of insect repellents and bug sprays on the market: sprays and lotions, chemical and natural, huge percentages of DEET and lower percentages, etc.</p>  <p>What type of mosquito repellent is most effective (for travelers to tropical destinations)? What types should be avoided or are just a marketing ploy?</p>  <p>I'm not asking for specific product recommendations, but general advice about types of insect repellent (e.g. 100% DEET vs. 30% vs. citronella oil, etc.).</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Starting a bounty to try to get a few more details. Thanks for the answers so far! But it would be great to see some real details (with references) about the effectiveness of different kinds of repellents, different concentrations of DEET, sprays vs. lotions, etc.</p> 
2471	Is Honduras good for backpackers?	<p>Is Honduras a good travel location for backpackers? I want to know where I can find good backpacking hostels in Honduras. What are some common backpacking travel cities or towns? I am a solo male traveler and am looking to go to Honduras in November. I will be there for 2 weeks. My budget is around $1000 not counting the airfare. Preferably I would love to stay on an island or beach for a week and then go experience the culture.</p> 
301	Is it worth getting a one-week public transportation pass for Rome?	<p>My friend and I are first-time travelers who will be visiting Rome for a week in late September. According to <a href="http://www.rome.info/transportation/tickets/" rel="nofollow">Rome.info</a>, a week pass could be gotten for 16 Euros. Is it worth buying a week-pass? More specifically:</p>  <ul> <li>Are all the touristy (and some non-touristy) places within walkable distance?</li> <li>Can the public transit take us to anywhere that we would want to go in Rome?</li> <li>Does the public transit run frequently? Is it safe?</li> </ul> 
2492	What are the best ways to prevent and/or relieve sand fly bites?	<p>Following on from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2044/what-type-of-mosquito-repellent-is-most-effective">the mosquito repellent question</a>, I would like to ask about another insect which for me is much harder to deal with, sand flies.</p>  <p>Answering <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2471/is-honduras-good-for-backpackers">a recent question about Honduras</a> brought back vivid memories of being forced to leave a Garifuna village due to our inability to prevent sand flies from attacking us, or to make it bearable in any way. Anything we had with us for dealing with mosquitoes seemed to be useless.</p>  <p>So what does work to keep sand flies away, is it DEET or does something work better for these critters? And if you do get bitten what should you do?</p>  <p>I'm also specifically interested in home remedies. If you didn't pack some modern western chemical and find yourself under siege in a remote location what kind of things do poor local people use to prevent or relieve sand fly bites?</p>

454	Is it cheaper and/or easier to buy a cheap tent and sleeping bag in Turkey or Bulgaria?	<p>I'm currently in Istanbul but will soon head west to the Romania/Bulgaria border (hitchhiking) and intend to buy a cheap tent and sleeping bag on the way. I don't need a famous brand. Just something that will keep out the weather and bugs and not break within a couple of months of use. Either a one-man or two-man tent.</p>  <p>I know from previous experience that camping is not very popular in some countries and that in some countries it can be very hard to find a shop selling camping supplies, or only expensive places like North Face are easy to find?</p>  <p>Would I have better luck in Turkey or Bulgaria?</p> 
2643	Winter apparel for Europe (November-December)	<p>I'm planning to go to Europe from 24 Nov - 5 Dec 2011</p>  <p>Since I come from tropical country, I really don't have any idea what should I wear during a winter.</p>  <p>I have checked the temperature for the same date but from last year (based on <a href="http://weather.uk.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx">http://weather.uk.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx</a>)</p>  <ul> <li>London : 8 - 11 Celcius ( 46-51 Farenheit) </li> <li>Amsterdam : 5 - 9 Celcius (41-48 Farenheit)  </li> <li>Munich : 1-6 Celcius (34-42 Farenheit) </li> <li>Lucerne : -3 - 0 Celcius (26-32 Farenheit) </li> <li>France : 4-8 Celcius (39-46 Farenheit)</li> </ul>  <p>What do I need to wear for these kind of temperature? </p>  <p>One more question : Is this jacket enough or I should put more layer below this? <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KAvDz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br> <a href="http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1182">http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1182</a></p> 
2647	Is it easier and/or cheaper to replace my lost tent in Albania or Greece?	<p>When travel.SE was shiny and new I asked <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/454/is-it-cheaper-and-or-easier-to-buy-a-cheap-tent-and-sleeping-bag-in-turkey-or-bul">a very similar question</a> which became a point of controversy but in the end it has remained open and thought to be on-topic under the circumstances.</p>  <p>Sadly I left the tent I bought in Bulgaria in the van of some guys I travelled with for a couple of days. Happily it had served me well and wouldn't've been good in rain anyway.</p>  <p>But now I'm in Sarandë, southern Albania and will soon cross Greece to Turkey. Since Greece is less cheap I've been thinking it would be really nice to camp. But I have no idea which country will be better for buying a cheap tent. Last time I got the cheapest one in Carrefour. I don't think Albania has Carrefour and I don't know what chains if any they do have. I also don't know what cheap chains are in Greece. Maybe I can get something cheaper in Albania since it's a cheap country, but maybe the country is too poor for a camping culture and it will be easier to find in Greece? Being the Balkans it's not so easy to get a rational answer about a nearby country when asking a local for advice.</p>  <p>I just want cheap, doesn't have to last more than a few months. No North Face brand name type stuff required.</p>  <p><strong>So Albania or Greece and what shops / stores / markets / chains / malls should I look out for?</strong></p> 
1858	Is there a feasible way to combine hitchhiking and couch surfing?	<p>On my previous trip I tried hitchhiking for the first time and became addicted so this year I'm spending six to twelve months traveling in East Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>  <p>I also tried couch surfing for the first time on my last trip and had a great experience in Budapest.</p>  <p>But then I ran into a problem...</p>  <p>When you're hitchhiking you never know if it will take a couple of hours or a couple of days to get to the next place. Or sometimes you're trying to get to one place and a driver offers a ride to another good place when nobody was going to your planned place.</p>  <p>Since the couch surfing website doesn't list peoples' phone numbers for obvious safety reasons and most people don't check their couch surfing account every hour or even every month it can be hard to hook up when plans are really vague.</p>  <p>Have I missed some obvious way to use the facilities offered by couch surfing? Is there another service that works better for vague wandering travellers to surf couches? Is there some equivalent a bit more like a chat room or such where I can tell an online travel community roughly where I'm going and get couch offers rather than writing to each person individually which is the only way I'm aware to use couch surfing?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p>I should've mentioned that I don't have a phone. It just wouldn't fit into my budget. I do have a netbook so sometimes I manage to find a free wifi hotspot and sometimes a local friend might give me a broadband dongle but most often I only have connection at accommodation and sometimes in cities.</p> 
2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
2522	Is it currently possible to drive from Durrës to Berat in Albania on the SH 4?	<p>I'm intending to hitchhike from Durrës to Berat on the SH 4, which looks like the obvious route.</p>  <p>But when I Google Maps for driving directions between these two cities it tells to drive back up to Tiranë first.</p>  <p>Sometimes Google Maps has some glitches in its data but maybe this highway can't be used right now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Albania#Highway_Sections_Under_Construction" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia mentions that part of it is under construction between Durrës and Rrogozhinë</a> but when I zoom in I can see cars on it.</p>  <p>So it's unclear whether the route can be used but some parts are not up to highway spec or contain detours, or whether I really do have to go back to Tiranë. Does anybody know?</p> 
2643	Winter apparel for Europe (November-December)	<p>I'm planning to go to Europe from 24 Nov - 5 Dec 2011</p>  <p>Since I come from tropical country, I really don't have any idea what should I wear during a winter.</p>  <p>I have checked the temperature for the same date but from last year (based on <a href="http://weather.uk.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx">http://weather.uk.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx</a>)</p>  <ul> <li>London : 8 - 11 Celcius ( 46-51 Farenheit) </li> <li>Amsterdam : 5 - 9 Celcius (41-48 Farenheit)  </li> <li>Munich : 1-6 Celcius (34-42 Farenheit) </li> <li>Lucerne : -3 - 0 Celcius (26-32 Farenheit) </li> <li>France : 4-8 Celcius (39-46 Farenheit)</li> </ul>  <p>What do I need to wear for these kind of temperature? </p>  <p>One more question : Is this jacket enough or I should put more layer below this? <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KAvDz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br> <a href="http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1182">http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1182</a></p> 
145	When and where do I have the highest chance of seeing auroras?	<p>I'm wondering what time of year is best, and what locations might be best, for catching the aurora.</p>  <p>I'm currently thinking of February up at Sweden's ice hotel, but since the whole point of the trip is so that my wife can see the Aurora, I want to pick a location that affords the best chances to see one.</p>  <p>Edit: Just adding a link so you can see realtime aurora activity in the northern hemisphere</p>  <p><a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast/3">http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast/3</a></p>  <p>I know this is anecdotal, but I ended up going to Iceland in late february during the new moon and saw the aurora 3 out of 6 nights I was there.  There was activity every single night but the biggest problem was weather.  It was cloudy almost every single night. </p> 
2811	Is there any possibility to view London from "The Gherkin"?	<p><strong>30 St Mary Axe</strong>, officially <strong>The Swiss Re Building</strong>, colloquially <strong>The Gherkin</strong> is one of the most prominent and tallest buildings in modern London, but it's proving difficult to find out for sure whether it has any public viewing platform or bar or restaurant accessible to the public, or any open days or such when an exception might be made to allow public viewing at certain special times.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QtdVNl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>There is a private restaurant and bar but not just anyone can go there.</p>  <p><strong>Is there any way for a normal member of the public to view London from this building?</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tQ2WF.jpg" alt="The view that few are able to enjoy"></p>

2697	What affordable beachfront hotels in or near San Diego should I consider?	<p>I'm looking for a beachfront hotel in or near San Diego for my family (on the theory that the water there is warmer than say Los Angeles or certainly Pizmo Beach).  I'm hoping to find a hotel near a beach suitable for beginner's surfing.  And by "affordable", I'm hoping for $200/night or less.  (Though I'll spend more if I'm convinced it's worthwhile or necessary.)</p> 
2539	How to avoid drinking vodka?	<p>This summer I spent some days in Moscow and St. Petersburg. There I also visited a friend at his home. We were there with its family and traditional they drunk a lot of vodka during the meal. We as their guests had also to take some glasses but obviously we had enough before our Russian friends ;) But it was very difficult to convince them that it isn't a good idea for us to drink any more vodka. I think we have slightly offended them.</p>  <p>So how can I avoid to drink a lot of vodka if I'm invited without obviously offending my host? I think it is not too difficult if I don't drink at all. Then I can say I don't drink for religious or medical reasons. But what is a good excuse if I already started and want to quit?</p> 
898	Shoes for long flight	<p>Does anyone have recommendations for great shoes for a long flight?  I usually wear running shoes, but my feet often get very uncomfortable after a few hours.</p> 
1451	What is the best time of year to visit Reykjavík?	<p>When I ask for the "best" time of year, I am looking for a reasonable balance of the following criteria, in order of importance: </p>  <ol> <li>Mild weather. Ideally, warm enough to have coffee outside in a light jacket during the day, cooling down at night.</li> <li>Not too much tourist activity. I'd like to be able to get a table at a restaurant and be surrounded by more locals than visitors.</li> <li>Inexpensive accommodations and flights. I prefer apartment rental to hotel rooms, but will accept data on either. </li> <li>The higher the likelihood of nice aurora sightings, the better!</li> </ol>  <p>Is there a time of the year when all of these factors intersect in Iceland?</p> 
2862	How difficult is it to find accommodation in South Africa in December / January?	<p>I plan to travel to South-Africa at the end of the year (last week of December, first Week of January). I plan to spend more or less two weeks there. My understanding is that this period is really high season. Hence I wonder how difficult it will be to find an accommodation at that period? Are there places that are advised or disadvised?</p> 
2575	Exiting Vancouver airport during a flight connection with New Zealand passport	<p>A friend on a NZ passport flies through Vancouver tomorrow, and has a few hours at the airport between international flights.  Can he exit to the 'outside world', given he has a valid passport etc? His luggage would be checked through to London anyway.  </p>  <p>(An authoritative link would be appreciated, if possible)</p> 
1106	Which airlines fly from Ulaanbaatar / Ulan Bator?	<p>Looking at getting back to London from Ulaanbaatar (Ulan Bator), Mongolia in mid August, and trying to reduce the price.  What airlines or crazy routes might exist?</p>  <p>Currently have found Aeroflot, Mongolian Airlines, Korean Air, and Air China - although obviously some of those are flying in the wrong direction.  Aeroflot seems to have the best price most days, although I can't find a supposed ULN to Berlin Mongolian Airlines flight...</p> 
2696	How to plan routes that aren't covered by Google Maps?	<p>For the next summer I'm planning to drive to some countries that aren't covered by the route planning tool of Google Maps. What other possibilities do I have to calculate the route approximately in advance?</p>  <p>Especially, Russia, Eastern Europe and Northern Africa.</p> 
1665	How to go on a submarine tour?	<p>I know some companies in Hawaii and grand cayman give you 45 min submarine tours for $400  </p>  <p>Is there a way to get a more authentic experience, like being on a sub for an entire weekend?<br> Or do you need to have a brother that is an ex-navy seal?</p> 
956	What is the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA?	<p>Given the extensive time taken for immigration formalities in the US, what is the shortest time to consider between connecting flights in the US, when coming from abroad?</p>  <p>Until now I have always entered the US at my destination. This is not always the cheapest option. I was told that 3 hours is the advised time to go through immigration and boarding of a connecting flight. Online booking sites still offer connecting flights, with a transfer times sometimes even less then 1 hour. </p> 
1304	Is there wifi in Astana Airport (Kazakhstan)?	<p>I have several hours stopover there tomorrow night. I'm debating sleeping in the airport or sleeping in a hotel - I can sleep anywhere, but if there's wifi in the airport that would seal the deal for me :D  </p>  <p>However I can't seem to find out definitively if there is wifi in the airport - free or not - the wiki article is rather sparse.</p> 
1407	Is there a resource to find free, open wifi hotspots?	<p>It would be great to know where free, publicly accessible (municipal or otherwise) hotspots are when travelling in foreign cities. Does such a utility exist (website/app etc.)? </p> 
2930	What's the deepest underwater tour available?	<p>Clearly scuba can only get you so far, and while <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1665/how-to-go-on-a-submarine-tour">we've discussed submarine tours</a> in the past, they are just jaunts.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/El3D8.jpg" alt="Submarine!"></p>  <p>What's the deepest you can actually go as a tourist, and what about if you were somehow able to charter a vessel (like I gather <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/james-cameron-commissions-submarine-to-film-avatar-2/63179/">James Cameron is planning on doing</a>)?</p> 
1677	Are there data plans for travelers in the USA?	<p>I intend to travel to the US for a month, and I would really like to use a lot of data traffic during the trip, for browsing, maps, Skype calls, etc. How can I do that? Should I buy a SIM? Do I have to order one in advance, or are data SIMs readily available in the airport? Is there any website that can show me competing options and maybe compare them?</p>  <p>Also, I guess SIMs are linked to one specific carrier. Does it matter which cellular carrier I choose, or do all have similar coverage and do all support GSM phones? Does it change from state to state? e.g. do some of the more states, like Hawaii, have limited coverage for some of the carriers?</p>  <p>In short I am clueless here, and would really appreciate any information about this.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: meanwhile I have found <a href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">this comparison between various data sim suppliers</a>, seems very useful though I'm not sure how reliable or up-to-date this page is.</p> 
688	Are cruises' Shore Excursions worth the money?	<p>We recently embarked on a 12-night cruise (my first) and noticed the exorbitant prices for the shore excursions at every port. My question is - Are these really worthwhile, given that they relieve all the stress of touring a strange land (but that's part of the experience, right?) and are guided? Or is it almost always better to disembark and make your own way? </p> 
1953	Accommodation, sights and food in Maui	<p>I just booked a flight for Maui from 20th October to 7th of November.</p>  <p>I am interested in hearing tips related to Maui. I know I can grab Lonely Planet for that, but first I'd like to hear some first hand information. I am after what to do, what not to do, what to visit, what to avoid, and also some more specific questions such as:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Where do you suggest living in the area of Lahaina? I am going with three other friends. Hotels seems kind of expensive so I think the best way for us would be to rent an apartment - any suggestions about this? Anyone happens to know a safe site to book/view an apartment/house </p></li> <li><p>Which places to visit? I would mainly like to see some natural beauties (parks, beaches, ..)</p></li> <li><p>Where to eat? I am looking for places in which I could get the best ratio for quality/price.</p></li> </ol> 
2939	What can I do to prevent passport stamps being put on blank pages?	<p>I'm running low on blank passport pages which are sometimes needed for full page visas such as those issued by Armenia, India, and Vietnam.</p>  <p>When I crossed the border into Turkey the other day I got my visa-on-arrival and stamp, but instead of putting it on a partly used page, which I have many, the guy at customs and immigration put them on a previously blank page. Now I have one fewer!</p>  <p><strong>What can I do to prevent or at least reduce the chances of this happening?</strong></p>  <p>It's worth remembering that there's likely to be a language barrier and it's always best to be ultra-nice to these border officials.</p>  <p>Has anybody heard of any trick such as sticking bit of paper in your passport, either blank, or looking a bit like visas? I have noticed that nobody ever stamps a page that has a remnant of something once stapled in there in Japan. There is a kind of stub that had its major part torn off along a perforation. Might I be able to emulate this somehow or would that even be worse making the blank pages invalid for full page visas due to having holes from staples? I know some things can get very picky when it comes to customs and immigration.</p> 
716	What kind of plug adapter should I pack for India?	<p>I'm travelling around a few cities in India, from Delhi to Bangalore. What type of plug adapter should I pack?</p> 
270	What rights do passengers have when flights in the USA are delayed?	<p>What rights do passengers on delayed flights in the USA have? In some countries, depending on the length and type of delay, passengers can receive a free phone call, meal ticket, lodging, booking on alternate carriers etc. Are there any rules in the USA or is it up to the airline to determine the policy? Also, does the kind of delay matter, for example weather delay, mechanical delay, air traffic delay etc.</p>  <p>I'm curious because a recent 1 hour weather delay on a short domestic flight meant that I was unable to make an international connection. Since that particular international flight only runs once on day, the 1 hour weather delay turned into a 24 hour delay. In my case, I didn't mind departing a day later, but I'm pretty sure that there were routes on other airlines that would have arrived at around the same time. Would I have any right to ask to be switched to those other airlines? Would it make a difference if it was a mechanical delay instead of a weather delay (ie. the airlines fault)?</p>

2582	What exactly is allemansrätten in Sweden?	<p>My understanding is that it is a limited right for a traveler to camp out on any "unsettled" property in Sweden, public or private. Of course, there are important restrictions, such as NO right to hunt or fish for food, and maybe some limitations on campfires.</p>  <p>What are the rights and responsibilities of someone under <em>allemansrätten</em>? And do other Nordic nations, Norway, Finland, Denmark, or others, offer similar "rights"?</p> 
2752	What's the absolute cheapest accommodation in Ioannina Greece?	<p>So hitchhiking is an unpredictable way to travel which is fun but tonight I find myself in downtown Ioannina, Greece.</p>  <p>Usually I'm pretty good at finding cheap lodgings but it turns out I'm not very good at Greece and my usual tricks don't work here. HostelBookers and HostelWorld show no hostels though one does show hotels which are way higher than hostel prices, plus a couple of places that are quite a distance away from the city.</p>  <p>I've also looked on TripAdvisor and I've searched Google and Google maps for all kinds of things like "cheap hotel", "hostel", "backpackers", "guest house", "cheap accommodation", "camping", etc. There are lots of annoying links to booking sites which then require further searches with no better results if you do bother going through them. I decided they were too spammy to waste much more time on.</p>  <p>The cheapest place I could find was about 50 euro! I would expect a hostel to be in the range of 10-15 euro.</p>  <p><strong>What is the cheapest accommodation in Ioannina, Greece?</strong></p> 
3115	Sightseeing for family in London?	<p>Are there any special sights in London that are suited for the very different interest of a family consisting of 5 persons between 20 and 60 years old?</p>  <p>I don't think that museums are a good choice.</p> 
2565	Do all German airports lack free wifi?	<p>I've just been talking to another traveller who was particularly grumpy about Munich airport not having free wifi when he was there recently.</p>  <p>Now I seem to recall that Germany has pretty strict laws prohibiting open wifi access because the person providing the wifi would have some responsibility if somebody were to do some hacking over their signal.</p>  <p>But I don't know whether that law prohibits all kinds of free wifi or only the kind where a user doesn't need a password or key or have to enter any kind of info into a page that comes up first before allowing through access to the net.</p>  <p>Or could it be some exclusivity deal where some restaurant or cafe paid the airport for rights to be the only WIFI provider or some such thing?</p>  <p>So is it only Munich airport that lacks free wifi or do all German airports lack free wifi due to a law as outlined above?</p> 
3129	Do all American ATMs charge an extra fee for cash withdrawals on a foreign card?	<p>I've just gone to take some cash out of an ATM (Cash Machine) in Seattle. I visited about half a dozen in the end, and every single one wanted to charge me an extra fee (typically about $3) for the cash withdrawl on my (non-US) card. This was at bank ATMs in the centre of town, at their branches, rather than in a supermarket or somewhere.</p>  <p>In the end I had to give up and let one of them charge me (I needed cash!), but it was both unexpected and rather annoying. Having gone to the trouble of getting a card that wasn't going to charge me lots to use it abroad, I'm instead hit with fees from the owner of the cash machine.</p>  <p>Was I really unlucky to only find ATMs that wanted to charge me as a foreign user, or do all American ATMs do that? And if only some do, what banks should I be trying to find to avoid being hit with the fee?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
3183	Most remote exclave?	<p>I'm a big fan of traveling to some extreme points, like for example the most northern point of Europe or the highest point of each country in Europe, etc. To find new ideas I would like to know the most remote exclave, island, etc of a Europe country, and also worldwide.</p>

885	French rules for long stay visa: OFII	<p>I was looking for somebody to guide me about the OFII rules catering to the French long stay visa.</p>  <p>I'm going as an exchange student to Nimes, France from Delhi, India. As my stay is over 90 days, I need to get the long stay visa. For this, I also need to get the OFII stamp on my passport from the prefecture of my department which is in Montpellier. Getting the OFII stamp is mandatory.</p>  <p>My question is: can I travel to Spain for La Tomatina or Germany for the Oktoberfest if I don't get the OFII stamp on my passport till then. I have heard that the borders are open and there's hardly any checking.</p>

210	Where would be the optimal place to watch the Nov 2012 Solar Eclipse from?	<p>There's a solar eclipse going across northern Australia on November 14th, 2012:</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_November_13,_2012" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_November_13,_2012">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_November_13,_2012</a></p>  <p>Given that climate and weather varies substantially from city to city in Northern Australia – especially around the coast – where would give the best chance to see the eclipse?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>Worth noting that in Australia (and anywhere else west of the date line), it'll actually be the 14th.  Hooray for international timezones being confusing!</p>  <p>Looking like Cairns / Oak Beach is the prime spot in therms of the line.  However, I've been told that traffic could be difficult.  If the one in Siberia attracted 10,000 people, this could receive even more.  </p> 
598	Where can I get information on freighter travel?	<p>I want to go from New York City to any destination in Europe on a freighter.  The only place I've found information for doing this requires a round trip.  I don't want to go round trip.  I want to spend some months in Europe and I don't care where in Europe I start.</p> 
115	Freight travel in the Caribbean - Can it be done? Is it cost-effective?	<p>When I began to research travel by freight boat, I was hoping it would be a cheap alternative to air travel, but it turns out you can expect to pay US$80-140 per day and voyages are often five days or even longer.</p>  <p>However, I'm curious whether anybody knows if there are freight boats that go between islands in the Caribbean, for example from Dominica to Martinique. If so, how does one book a voyage on one of them? Do you have to go through a travel agent? Is it cheaper than flying?</p> 
558	Is there a boat that will take tourists to Iceland from North America?	<p>I'm certain that the lucky Europeans have a boat that will get them from there to Iceland.  Is there a way for tourists to get from the US or Canada to Iceland?</p> 
2181	What supporting evidence is required for a Moroccan travel visa?	<p>I plan to travel to Morocco later this year and wanted to check if anyone with previous experience getting a travel visa can shed some light here. <a href="http://www.moroccanembassylondon.org.uk/en/viisa.html">The Embassy of Morocco in the UK</a> states that for a travel visa, the following documents are required (among others):</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Copy of your detailed <strong>provisional</strong> flight itinerary.</li>   <li>Hotel <strong>provisional</strong>    reservation or notarized Letter of Invitation   from your sponsor in    Morocco.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>However, <a href="http://www.visaguru.co.uk/182/223/India/Morocco/visa-requirements.htm">Visa Guru</a>...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Copy or Original hotel confirmation (Hotel confirmation must show   <strong>paid in full</strong>.)</p> </blockquote>  <p>...and <a href="http://morocco.visahq.co.uk/requirements/India/resident-United_Kingdom/">Visa HQ</a>...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Copy of <strong>confirmed</strong> hotel reservations <strong>issued directly from the hotel</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>...seem to imply stricter restrictions on what is an acceptable form of accommodation proof. So my questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Is a booking done through a third-party site (Hostelworld, Expedia, the lot) acceptable?</li> <li>Does the accommodation booking <em>have</em> to be paid for in full? (Because with some booking websites, only a deposit is taken.)</li> <li>Is a hostel booking (rather than a hotel booking) - either paid partly or in full - even considered as a valid supporting document for a Moroccan travel visa?</li> </ol>

2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
3328	Travelling using the Underground (the Tube) in London	    <p>I will stay in London for only 2 days, but will travel using underground train (tube) quite often.</p>  <p>So my questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Should I buy an Oyster card?  What is the minimum deposit of Oyster? How long is the validity of the Oyster card?</li> <li>Is there any card that I can buy that allow me to travel freely for 2 days without any extra charge? (Something like 15 pounds card that will expire within 24 hours, but can be used countless times)</li> <li>Or anybody has any other alternative?</li> </ol>  <p>UPDATE : from the link that I duplicated, I found all of the info I needed in <a href="http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/</a></p> 
1772	How can I translate medicines?	<p>I know that if I have stomach issues I can take an <em>Enterogermina</em> or an <em>Imodium</em> if things get severe. I know that if I have throat ache, I can take a <em>Benagol</em>. I know that if I have a strong headache a <em>Tachipirina</em> can reduce the pain.</p>  <p>However, those names are all Italian. Now, I did bring a few of those with me, but I might have to buy more now that I'm in the Netherlands, and drugs aren't like other products where I can look at the packaging/branding and recognize the Italian equivalent thereof.</p>  <p>How can I translate drug names?</p> 
882	Shipping my car from Europe to Canada or the U.S	<p>The plan is to drive my car (<a href="http://0.tqn.com/d/4wheeldrive/1/0/O/L/1/Alek_Ser_04LadaNiva_2RR.jpg">a small 4x4</a>) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay">Prudhoe Bay</a><sup>1</sup> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhorse,_Alaska">Deadhorse</a>), Alaska to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn">Cape Horn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> in Chile. I will be travelling for an undetermined duration, with a minimum of two years. (I know it can be done a lot faster, but it's about the journey, the destination is just an excuse).</p>  <p>We will leave in the first week of January, 2013. For various reasons, I've decided to bring my own car. So, I'll need to ship it from Europe to Canada.</p>  <p><br/> <strong>My questions are:</strong>  </p>  <ul> <li>Has anybody shipped a car between Europe and Canada or the U.S.?  </li> <li>What kind of cost am I looking at?  </li> <li>Any gotchas I need to know about?</li> </ul>  <p><br/> <strong>Quick Update</strong><br> I'll be shipping from wherever is the cheapest option in Europe (mainland) and shipping to the cheapest option in Canada or the U.S.</p>  <p><br/> <strong>Extra Information</strong><br> Many people suggested buying a car in either Canada or Alaska. But that does not answer the question I was asking : ) The car has some very nice base characteristics (very small, very good off-road ability, cheap) and in addition has special modifications for long range independent travel (such as, but not limited to, extended fuel- and water tanks) and in addition, I know this car's history so I can make an informed estimate about it's reliability. <em>So, I've decided to bring this car</em>. The question is now, what's the best/cheapest option to ship it.</p>  <p>I will likely <em>not</em> re-register the car in the U.S. nor Canada. I've heard from several travellers that it increases hassle if your car is registered in a different country than you live in, so, for now, the plan is to keep the car registered in my home country.</p>  <p><sub><sup>1)</sup> I Actually wanted to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow,_Alaska">Barrow</a>, but it turn out the 200 miles between there and Deadhorse are <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7798/getting-to-barrow-alaska-overland">an expedition in itself</a></sub>.</p> 
2905	Air New Zealand's policy on obese passengers	<p>A friend had a rough experience from Honolulu to Auckland, as she describes below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I was under the impression that they are required to purchase two   (economy) seats on flights or is that an old wives(sic) tale? I was   subjected to sitting next to a lady on a packed flight from Honolulu   to Auckland overnight. I'm not judging her personally for her size but   more for it's(sic) affect(sic) on my experience. Her stomach extended right to   the seat in front, the armrest couldn't go down between my seat and   hers, consequently she was spilling into my seat which only got worse   when she fell asleep. I sat all kinked to one side over my partner,   missed my second meal as the first had been a farce to try and   negotiate, didn't get any sleep and spent 6hrs out of the 9.5hr flight   crying (as silently as I could so the lady wasn't aware, hopefully).</p>      <p>The poor flight crew were lovely and apologetic but could do nothing.   I would like to know who I can contact to at least give me information   on wheather this is just tough bikkies or if this should've been   handled differently when that lady came to checking in? I paid a good   fare to be on that flight and even though it sounds horrible I think   she should have been told she couldn't fly until two seats together   were available on a later flight.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've been looking but can't find anything about a policy on this, if they even have one.  Anyone else have better resource knowledge of this area?</p> 
3353	Are all trains/buses within the EU non-smoking? What about smoking on platforms?	<p>No, I'm not a smoker, but some friends coming on a trip with me are, and they want to know what their options are (I suppose some of the 12+ hour journeys we have planned frighten them).</p>  <p>Personally, I hope it's banned everywhere, but you never know. </p>  <p>Let's limit it to the EU and the EEA. We can assume that <em>most</em> places prohibit smoking on the train, so let's hear if there are any exceptions, and which countries forbid smoking in the station (the UK is one, I believe).</p>

3377	Are there ways to keep long-distance land transport costs down in France when not planning in advance?	<p>Ten years ago I travelled around Europe for the first time and in some countries I was very frustrated by high cost of trains and lack of alternatives to them.</p>  <p>I remember being in Cannes with a friend who had tons of money. I had already spent most of my inheritance despite trying to keep costs as low as possible.</p>  <p>We wanted to do something vaguely like Cannes - Avignon - Lyon - Dijon - Paris (I can't remember exactly any more).</p>  <p>But it seemed that each hop in back-then prices on the TGV was about 50 euro whereas we could go straight to Paris for something like 100 euro.</p>  <p>Furthermore, unlike Germany which I was used to travelling around in by then, there seemed to be no cheaper options for slower trains. I always chose the slowest train because I was never in a hurry and enjoyed the scenery. But in France there was no such option.</p>  <p>In other countries I knew how to travel in, like Australia or Canada or Mexico or would take a long distance bus. But as covered by another question, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3375/why-does-there-seem-to-be-no-long-distance-buses-in-france">there don't seem to be any long distance buses in France</a>.</p>  <p>So this lone option of the TGV made it at least double the price and I had already blown some money on trains from Monaco to Nice to Cannes.</p>  <p>We argued and debated and decided it would be worth the gamble to take a train to Marseilles where we expected we would have a lot more options than in Cannes. But when we got there we found it bigger and busier but with the same expensive TGVs and still no other cheaper slower options.</p>  <p>We gave up and just went straight to Paris very grumpy. To this day I have been put off trying to travel around France for the same reason.</p>  <p>So enough whiny anecdotes and on with the actual question: <strong>Were we doing it wrong? Are there ways to visit all these places without blowing the budget on TGV tickets? Is there any other mode of long-distance overland travel within France?</strong> (No flying please, I want to go on roads or tracks through the countryside.)</p>  <p>Oh and just to make it difficult, I like to travel with no plans. So I can't buy passes or book tickets months ahead and I'm too old for student specials.</p> 
1238	Do Australian citizens still get visa-free entry for 360 days in Georgia (the country)?	<p>Australian citizens definitely used to need a visa to enter the Republic of Georgia a few years back.</p>  <p>Then last year (2010) I entered by land from Turkey and was given a 360-day stamp at the border with no visa necessary.</p>  <p>Now (July 2011) <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/visas/visas-aabgm.html" rel="nofollow">the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website</a> says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you are an Australian citizen, you need a visa to visit Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Moldova.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is this a poorly maintained website or has Georgia really flipflopped on the visa rules for Australian citizens?</p> 
3410	Will I get in trouble if I drink beer in public in Dubai?	<p>As far as I know, Dubai is a Muslim country. And as far as I know, it is forbidden to drink alcohol in Muslim countries. Is this also true for Dubai and tourists?</p>  <p>So as a tourist can I drink alcohol in public? And should I? And are there any special rules during Ramadan?</p> 
3418	Which countries are "Muslim countries"?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3410/will-i-get-in-trouble-if-i-drink-beer-in-public-in-dubai">the question about drinking beer in Dubai</a> it arose that the term "Muslim country" can be seen as one where the laws of the country are affected by the rules of the religion (like Dubai), whereas other countries may be secular countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations (like Turkey).</p>  <p>So which of the countries that have high Muslim populations are not secular and have laws based on the religion?</p>  <p>(I know this is asking for a list but it's a small, definite, closed set so not "too broad" in the sense possible with many questions.)</p> 
3424	Overlanding in Egypt without a carnet de passage?	<p>I know some people have entered Egypt without a Carnet de Passage so I know it is possible, what I need to know is how long can you drive it in Egypt that way, I know with a Carnet it is 6 months maximum but how long is it without?</p>  <p>Another question is: is it official? I mean is that how it is officially done according to laws and regulations or was that a way to get around them like almost everything in Egypt?</p>  <p>If anyone has done that before please give me all the details you have.</p>  <p>I have to take my car from Canada to Egypt and for a Carnet de Passage en Douane from Canada they require an irrevocable letter of credit for $120,000 US that's twice as much as the car's value (brand new) or instead I can pay an indemnity option for $55,000 which they will return $22,000 of when the car gets back to Canada (I lose 33,000 for EVERY YEAR), and I'm not sure if it will return so there's no way for me doing it either way. Then I heard about an Egyptian carnet you can get at the border for less than $1,000 dollars, which will totally solve my problem so I really need some information about this.</p>  <p>Any information will be highly appreciated.</p> 
2119	Are some parts of Iraq currently possible to visit for the brave, adventurous, and open-minded traveller?	<p>OK I know Iraq is utterly totally off the vast majority of people's itineraries for the immediate future.</p>  <p>But I am pretty sure I have heard of some extreme adventurous types going there and following the "ask the locals which parts really should be avoided" rule when they get there.</p>  <p>For instance most people wouldn't go to Pakistan or Colombia now either for safety reasons, yet following this rule many adventurous travellers go to these destinations and have an amazing time.</p>  <p>So what I want to know is if you are even tougher than those guys and know what you are doing is it possible to visit any parts of Iraq at all, or is it strictly a case of "join the army" if you want to go.</p>  <p>Please don't submit answers not aimed specifically at extreme travellers.</p> 
983	Can I get warfarin in Tajikistan (or nearby?)	<p>I've run into a major problem, requiring urgent Warfarin.  However, am in Khorog, Tajikistan, and there's NONE in town, and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country, save for the 5 tablets in my bag.</p>  <p>My question is, <strong>what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for (NZ passport), which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin</strong>.</p>  <p>I have an entry visa for Russia if need be - if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...</p> 
185	Is there a list of free accomodation resources?	<p>I want to travel abroad cheap, and I would prefer to find some place to stay through a person or website, rather than book a hotel or hostel. There is <a href="http://couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a>, which I know about. Can you recommend other resources where I can find free accomodation?</p> 
1014	How can I avoid or minimize jet lag?	<p>From my personal anecdotal experience, I've found it worse when travelling east around the globe.  I also tend to stay awake most if not all of the flight, so sleeping time doesn't tend to matter as the flights from London to NZ are minimum 28 hours.  Shorter flights you can arrange around daylight hours to reduce this, but otherwise, there must be better strategies to help out with.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>So I was fine despite nearly 48 hours of non-sleep from Mongolia to London, up the next 3 days at 8am to do stuff. However, the <em>second</em> week has been awful, sleepless nights and erratic sleepiness. Any theories?</p>  <p><strong><em>Also see: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2841/how-do-you-prepare-for-long-haul-flights/">How do you prepare for long haul flights?</a></em></strong></p> 
2841	How do you prepare for long haul flights?	<p>I'm always feeling a bit unwell during and after long haul flights. I lose my appetite, can't sleep in the plane, food has no taste no matter what. However, I'm pretty sure it's not the flying itself, since I did fly small planes for about 2 years and had fun doing that. I'm also pretty sure it's not the jetlag's fault.</p>  <p>Is there anything I can do to prepare my body for long-haul flights, say Australia-Europe (that's about 2x 12h long flights, and maybe 1-3h stopover in Asia)? </p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
3085	Dual nationality, EU and Australian. Does it matter which passport is "travelled on"	<p>I plan to visit Australia from the UK, I am an Australian national with dual nationality - I also hold a Greek passport.  I have all the correct documentation and everything is fine.</p>  <p>However, if I leave the UK and present my Australian passport to immigration control on exit from Heathrow, will this then pose problems when I return back to the UK and present my Greek passport. I will be carrying both passports.</p>

2049	Can Serbian dinars be exchanged in the Republic of Macedonia?	<p>I just crossed the border from Serbia to the Republic of Macedonia and was surprised that the currency exchange booth on the Macedonian side accepted Euros but not Serbian dinar.  </p>  <p>Generally I've found even in places that are not very friendly at least at the border it's possible to exchange money if not elsewhere.  </p>  <p>Does this mean that I won't be able to change my Serbian money for Macedonian money? I didn't expect Macedonia to be on unfriendly terms with Serbia.  </p> 
1224	Tactics to avoid getting harassed by corrupt police?	<p>In Uzbekistan I was stopped, searched and questioned six times in one day.</p>  <p>At the border with Tajikistan, one official tried hiding my paperwork to elicit something from me.</p>  <p>In Kyrgyzstan, I was physically harassed and detained by the police, and about US$30 taken while they searched everything on me and a Dutch backpacker I was going to get food with.</p>  <p>I'm not particularly dodgy looking - it's happening to a lot of backpackers I meet.  Tourists are apparently a prime target for corrupt officials.</p>  <p>Any suggestions or tactics for avoiding these occurrences?  Aside from carrying only photocopies of your passport so that they can't hold your passport ransom, I've not heard many successful tips...</p> 
1596	Changing unusual foreign currencies in London	<p>I've just returned from several unusual countries in Asia, and annoyingly despite being told I'd have no problem, I'm unable to find anyone in London to change back to pounds.</p>  <p>I've tried Travelex in Heathrow, a currency exchange place, and the post office.</p>  <p>The currencies include cash from: Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>  <p>Most of the responses when shown the money is to the tone of "What the hell currency is this?" which doesn't fill me with confidence.</p>  <p>Any suggestions welcomed for places that may change this. Otherwise I may need to go back next year ;)</p> 
3198	How many countries are there in the world to travel to?	<p>If you've travelled a bit, at some point you'll either have dreamed of or been asked - 'will you visit every country in the world?'.  However, it's not a straightforward goal to aim for...</p>  <p>I've heard much debate on this.  Is Kosovo a country? Not according to the U.N.!  Is Gibraltar a country? Do you separate England, Scotland and Wales?  Is French Guyana a part of France?</p>  <p>Chris Guillebeau, one of the most well known travellers and country counters, has over <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/places-ive-been/" rel="nofollow">160 countries under his belt</a>.  Of course, as you travel you realise it becomes harder and harder to define what IS a country...</p>  <p><em><strong>bonus:</em></strong></p>  <p>And so, for the country counters or just those who may have a definitive answer (with references please) - how many countries are there in the world that you would consider you have travelled to, if you'd been to all of them?</p> 
226	What seasonal work can fund travel?	<p>I'm fond of the travel strategy that involves arriving at a workplace near your destination and doing seasonal labor until you've saved enough to have fun in and around the same geographical area.</p>  <p>The archetypal way of doing this is to get a job at an Alaskan cannery or fishing operation and process seafood for a season and then you've got your expenses and flight home paid for, plus some money to burn running around Alaska, skiing, rafting, camping, etc.</p>  <p>What I want to know, is what other similar scenarios exist where there is a ready, high-turnover job market located in a part of the world where I can also get my tourist jollies.</p> 
1013	Website resources for 'out there' jobs related to travel	<p>I've come across a few travel + working websites - which can get you a 'non-standard' job in a remote place - <a href="http://escapethecity.org/" rel="nofollow">like EscapeTheCity</a> which has had roles from post office master in Antarctica to landmine defuser to chocolate taster.  </p>  <p>I'm looking for 'something' - preferably in Latin America - ideally travel related, and I'm struggling to find work+travel websites that aren't just 'volunteer-tourism' where you end up paying to do it.  I currently work as a software contractor, but given my explosion of interest in travel the last few years, and having done some fairly hard travel, have some experience of that.</p>  <p>Hiking/trekking guide - no, don't have the physical ability to lead something like that.</p>  <p>But working with animals, sure, leading tours, sure, teaching English in the jungle, sure that also could be interesting.  But something related to tours - organising, leading, researching or travelling-ahead-to-prepare-for-the-group would be my ideal short-term goal for a role.</p>  <p>These are however kinda non-standard and not that often advertised for.  Any travel working resources would be of interest.  This could probably be a community wiki too.</p> 
3589	Driving into Germany over Easter weekend	<p>There's a Demoscene party (<a href="http://revision-party.net/">Revision</a>) that occurs every year on the Easter weekend in Saarbrücken (Germany), and I'm thinking of attending this year. I live in England and am looking into methods of transport for getting there.</p>  <p>It looks like plane tickets are going to be extortionate as usual (£350+ return per person) so I'm thinking of driving instead. Since there's two of us (perhaps three, depending) we can split the fuel costs and it should be enough to cut the cost down. I'm planning on taking the channel tunnel to Calais, then driving up into Belgium, just round the edge of Luxembourg (not actually crossing the border), then down into Germany. Google maps <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Birmingham,%20England&amp;daddr=Saarbruecken,%20Germany&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.207607,0.626221&amp;spn=5.764577,16.907959&amp;sll=50.993014,4.658203&amp;sspn=5.92058,16.90795">says it's 9 hours</a>, so I'm guessing it'll probably end up being around 12 hours total.</p>  <p>I've never driven in another country before and am looking for tips as to how to remain comfortable, safe and save money.</p>  <p>Here's my list so far:</p>  <ul> <li>Bring spare food, drink, clothes and blankets.</li> <li>Fully stocked first-aid kit, flashlight, spare batteries, plasters, medical insurance cards, etc.</li> <li>Plenty of tools and spares for the car (including spare tyre and a jack)</li> <li>Take maps as well as sat-nav (low battery = lost!)</li> <li>Phrase books.</li> <li>Secondary phone left switched off but fully charged, for emergencies.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm also unsure as to the situation with border fees and car insurance / breakdown cover. Will I need to inform the authorities of each country that I'll be driving through, and get appropriate documents? Or is it just a case of being covered automatically in the EU?</p> 
3592	Getting from the Frankfurt-Hahn airport to Saarbrücken (Germany)	<p>I posted a question (<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3589/driving-into-germany-over-easter-weekend">Driving into Germany over Easter weekend</a>) about getting to Saarbrücken for a demoscene party and it looks like flying might actually be the cheapest option. I can get to Frankfurt-Hahn airport (HHN) for £92 return from London, but it's about 100km away from Saarbrücken.</p>  <p>I'm pretty sure I can get a train or bus, but I'd much rather use a train due to the chronic motion-sickness I tend to suffer on buses. And yes, I've tried pretty much every trick and medication in the book, but that's another story.</p>  <p>Are there any direct(-ish) trains from Frankfurt-Hahn to Saarbrücken, and how much are they likely to cost?</p>  <p>Any other tips for travelling on trains in Germany are welcome too. I shouldn't have <em>too much</em> trouble with the language though - my conversational German is pretty poor, but I can ask for directions to most things and understand simple responses (at about the "erste straße rechts" level, at least).</p> 
2995	Venice Marco Polo Airport to Venice	<p>I am wondering if someone could suggest the cheapest method of travelling from Venice Marco Polo Airport into Venice itself.

3625	Legalities and safety concerns of visiting prostitutes in Amsterdam	<p>A friend of mine left his girlfriend after a long (~5 years) relationship. To cheer him up a little bit, we decided to go to Amsterdam, as they have liberal prostitution and drug consuming laws. </p>  <p>We're planning to get him laid every day while over there. But we're not really used to bargain with hookers and assessing the quality. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/M7ilD.jpg" alt="red light block in Amsterdam"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rWSph.jpg" alt="neon lights of an entrance"></p>  <p>I have a set of important questions:</p>  <ul> <li>What price level are we talking about?</li> <li>Is it considered rude to ask a hooker for references?</li> <li>Is there a chance to get into trouble? How can I avoid that?</li> <li>I also heard that there are a lot of illegal sex workers practicing in Amsterdam.

3596	Places to stop off along the Sydney to Brisbane railway?	<p>I'm hoping this is a constrained enough question to not produce either long lists, or lots of subjective answers, so here goes...</p>  <p>In December I'm going to want to get from Sydney to Brisbane. I won't have a car, and it's just a one way trip, so the obvious choices would seem to be either fly, or take the train. (Well, train then bus from Casino!) While the train looks to be slightly cheaper, when luggage fees are included, I've noticed that a <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/discovery">CountryLink East Coast Discover Pass</a> is about the same price as the flight + bag fees.</p>  <p>If I was to get a <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/discovery">CountryLink East Coast Discover Pass</a>, then I'd be able to make my way from Sydney up to Brisbane by train + bus, stopping as often as I like (as long as I don't backtrack). My idea was to maybe take something like 3-4 days to do the trip, stopping at a couple of places along the way (plus charging my gadgets up too - one snag I hit last time with the train is the lack of power points!)</p>  <p>What I'm not sure on is where along the North Coast that's served by CountryLink is worth stopping at for a day? I won't have a car with me, nor will I have that long, so visiting some of the more far-flung beaches is out. Between Sydney and Grafton I'm largely limited to two trains a day (I don't think I'll want to take the overnight one), and for the Garfton to Brisbane leg I've no real choice (XPT to Casino then bus looks the only sensible bet). The <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/timetables">timetable listing is here</a>, and <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/17259/NorthCoastRegion-23_Oct_2011.pdf">this is the current timetable</a></p>  <p>For places to stop off at, they'd need sensibly priced accommodation near the station, as I'll likely not be packed for long walks with everything. I wouldn't mind a stop that would allow for some scuba diving, but otherwise places with one of interesting walking, a nice beach or a museum would be good. Oh, and I probably wouldn't stop at Surfers or anywhere north of there, as I can pop back to them from Brisbane later! I guess in addition to a whole day stop, I could always get the earlier Casino XPT, hop off for a couple of hours and see somewhere, then take the later Grafton XPT on to where I'm staying, so suggestions for somewhere for a museum / quick walk / etc might also be good!</p>  <p>So, along the route covered by the discovery pass, are there any places that would be recommended for a 1 day stop? And anywhere that might be interesting for a few hours?</p> 
2949	Shipping a computer from Europe to the U.S	<p>I plan to be travelling to the United States from Europe (the Netherlands specifically) and want to bring my computer. I measured it and it exceeds the dimensions for hand luggage. I'm worried that if I put it in my trunk that it'll be damaged by the rough treatment luggage receives. What would be the best way to ship my computer without having to worry that it'll be dropped from a few feet height (like regular luggage is).</p>

2044	What type of mosquito repellent is most effective?	<p>There are many different kinds of insect repellents and bug sprays on the market: sprays and lotions, chemical and natural, huge percentages of DEET and lower percentages, etc.</p>  <p>What type of mosquito repellent is most effective (for travelers to tropical destinations)? What types should be avoided or are just a marketing ploy?</p>  <p>I'm not asking for specific product recommendations, but general advice about types of insect repellent (e.g. 100% DEET vs. 30% vs. citronella oil, etc.).</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Starting a bounty to try to get a few more details. Thanks for the answers so far! But it would be great to see some real details (with references) about the effectiveness of different kinds of repellents, different concentrations of DEET, sprays vs. lotions, etc.</p> 
3763	What to expect at Chinese customs when bringing in items for friends who live there?	<p>I am taking a trip to Shanghai next week to see some friends.  They have requested that I bring a few items with me to give to them that are difficult (or expensive) for them to obtain where they live:</p>  <ul> <li>Gluten-free crackers and pizza crust mix</li> <li>Personal lubricant</li> <li>Vitamins</li> <li>Energy drink mix</li> <li>Dental floss</li> <li>Swiss army knife</li> <li>Vegetable peeler</li> <li>Designer earrings (18K gold)</li> </ul>  <p>As this will be my first time travelling to China, I'm not sure what to expect, and I would like to know if there's anything I should be aware of:</p>  <ul> <li>Will I need to declare any of these items specifically on the immigration form? <ul> <li>Are there any special considerations since I will not be taking these items out of the country when I leave?</li> </ul></li> <li>Are there any items that will be confiscated or destroyed if I bring them with me?</li> <li>Will I be charged a duty or import tax on any of these items?</li> <li>Is there anything else I should know before attempting to bring these items into China?</li> </ul>  <p>Also, the value of the earrings is in excess of the ¥2.000 threshold noted in <a href="http://shanghai.customs.gov.cn/Default.aspx?tabid=5674" rel="nofollow">the document linked from Ankur's answer</a>, so it seems that I will need to pay a duty tax on them.  This raises a couple of additional questions:</p>  <ul> <li>What is the duty tax rate for US citizens?</li> <li>Can I pay the duty tax in US Dollars or with a credit card, or will I need to acquire Renminbi before I arrive?</li> </ul>  <p>I am a US citizen coming in on a single-entry tourist ("L") visa.</p> 
3804	Curonian Spit and Kaliningrad	<p>The <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/994">Curonian Spit</a> is one of the places I would like to visit. As an EU citizen, the obvious approach is to focus on the Lithuanian side. </p>  <p>Nevertheless, I wonder if it is worthwhile to pay a visit to the Russian side of the spit in particular and to Kaliningrad in general. Is it worth incurring the additional hassle, such as e.g. obtaining a Russian visa? If yes, how much time would you allow? Is it something that could be done on a day trip from Lithuania or is it better to spend a couple of days in the Kaliningrad oblast?</p> 
3826	Best Time for Visiting the Curonian Spit	<p>I am interested in visiting the Curonian Spit, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/3804/766">possibly with a sidetrip to Kaliningrad</a>. Now I would like to know the best time of the year to do so. I would like to avoid the crowds of the high and peak seasons. On the other hand, I would like to avoid the dead season (if there is one) as well, when most of the restaurants, shops and attraction are likely to be closed. Also note that I do not care about temperature. </p> 
2975	Overview of wireless in airports?	<p>This summer I travelled by plane a lot. At some airports there was Internet available, but at many I couldn't find any free Internet access. Is there something like an overview available that lists as many airports as possible and indicates if there is free Internet available at these airports?</p> 
1615	Travelling by train in mainland Europe, will I save money by booking my tickets early?	<p>My wife and I are planning to travel by train from Nice to Budapest over the course of 2 weeks, stopping at a number of towns and cities on the way.</p>  <p>We'd prefer the flexibility of booking our tickets on the day of travel, but are wary of ticket prices rising the closer you get to the travel date (as happens markedly here in the UK). However, do European train ticket prices generally vary in this way, or would a ticket booked on the day cost the same as one booked in advance?</p>  <p>My initial tests on <a href="http://www.raileurope.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Rail Europe</a> suggest that the price remains constant, but it would be good to get confirmation from someone more experienced in European train travel.</p>  <p>Our route is likely to be: Nice to Verona to Salzburg to Vienna to Budapest.</p> 
2643	Winter apparel for Europe (November-December)	<p>I'm planning to go to Europe from 24 Nov - 5 Dec 2011</p>  <p>Since I come from tropical country, I really don't have any idea what should I wear during a winter.</p>  <p>I have checked the temperature for the same date but from last year (based on <a href="http://weather.uk.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx">http://weather.uk.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx</a>)</p>  <ul> <li>London : 8 - 11 Celcius ( 46-51 Farenheit) </li> <li>Amsterdam : 5 - 9 Celcius (41-48 Farenheit)  </li> <li>Munich : 1-6 Celcius (34-42 Farenheit) </li> <li>Lucerne : -3 - 0 Celcius (26-32 Farenheit) </li> <li>France : 4-8 Celcius (39-46 Farenheit)</li> </ul>  <p>What do I need to wear for these kind of temperature? </p>  <p>One more question : Is this jacket enough or I should put more layer below this? <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KAvDz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br> <a href="http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1182">http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1182</a></p> 
529	Is it possible to go directly from Siem Reap to Vientiane over land?	<p>I'm planning on going to Vietiane in Laos, but I wanted to cross over land from Cambodia. Are there direct bus connections from Siem Reap to Vientiane, and if so, how long does the journey take? I have heard conflicting reports - some say yes, some say there's no way around it but to double back to Phnom Penh and catch a bus from there to Vientiane, which doesn't make sense at all to me. Or, if not a direct bus from Siem Reap, then is it possible to get to Stung Treng checkpoint by local bus, then connect to Vientiane from there? (If not bus, boats / ferries are acceptable too.)</p>  <p>I have also heard that even though the official Lao immigration site says visa-on-arrival is available at land border checkpoints, they have stopped issuing them at Stung Treng and require visitors to get a visa beforehand. Is that true?</p> 
1060	Recommended destinations located close to Siem Reap, Cambodia	<p>My wife and I are planning an "adventure" honeymoon to South East Asia in February 2012.  We have our eye currently on Angkor Wat (Siem Reap, Cambodia).  Our honeymoon will be for 2 weeks and we are interested to hear what other places in the surrounding area that are recommended as we know Angkor Wat will not take 2 weeks to see.  We are up for taking a short flight or bus and crossing into other countries.  We like hiking, jungle tours, seeing animals, beaches, and seeing interesting "old" things such as temples and ruins.  We're not fans of big cities and night clubbing/partying.  We are both seasoned travellers.  Any suggestions or small "hidden gems" would be highly appreciated!</p> 
3893	How to cope with dry hands and cracking skin when travelling in cold locations?	<p>So I'm from a pretty warm country, Australia but now I've spent my first month in cold Tbilisi Georgia and I lack the local know-how and intuition of how to cope with some aspects of cold winters. I asked <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2646/will-i-need-to-take-special-precautions-for-spending-the-winter-in-tbilisi-geor">a general question about dealing with winter here</a> before I arrived, but now that I'm here I have some more specific concerns:</p>  <p>It has been getting only as low as -3°C or 26°F which seems to be the typical minimum temperatures for December and January here. It's snowed a few times but it's mostly dry and so far it hasn't been very windy. For instance I'm doing fine without a proper winter coat/jacket for now.</p>  <p>I assume in my ignorance that the combination of cold, dryness, and putting my hands in and out of my pockets a lot is the reason I've now got rough sore skin on the backs of my hands, occasionally splitting and bleeding.</p>  <p>So will hand cream / moisturiser fix this, and if so, aloe vera, lanolin, what works best?</p>  <p>Or is it that I should have winter gloves? If so, what kind? I remember my father used to get cracked skin on his hands from wearing gloves with an fluffy but absorbent lining so I'm worried I might buy the wrong kind and make things worse.</p>  <p>I'm not sure whether I should get synthetic or natural fibre, or blended; lined or not and what kind of lining, how tight or coarse the stitching should be, etc. I'm really totally ignorant.</p>  <p><strong>I do have some srong preferences.</strong> I'm on a really tight budget and whenever possible I prefer to live as the locals do. I'm in a poor country where most people can't afford hi tech things such as gore tex. I also can't afford them and want to do it the local way in any case.</p>  <p>15 years ago I spent a much colder winter in Canada and had the same problem. I bought cheap modern synthetic gloves but they didn't keep my fingers as warm as making fists and keeping my hands in my pockets, and I did use hand cream but after a couple of months it got so bad I gave up and moved to a warmer country. This time I don't want to give up (or have bleeding hands).</p> 
2646	Will I need to take special precautions for spending the winter in Tbilisi, Georgia?	<p>I'm on my way to Tbilisi Georgia where I plan to stay all winter and since I'm from a warm country I'd like to know how cold it will get and whether I will need to invest in some winter clothing and gear.</p>  <p>I'm from Australia but I've travelled a lot with winters in Western Europe, USA, and Canada and I've experienced as low as -40 degrees below zero so I know I can handle it.</p>  <p>But winters vary greatly. I would've expected Georgia to be frozen but I'm told the capital is pretty temperate and every time I asked my friends if there was snow last winter I got the answer "not yet". I think the Caucasus mountains offer a lot of protection.</p>  <p>So how cold can I expect it to get? Is there typically no snow, only bits that melt again, or does it pile up and get icy and slippery? How about wind and rain and humidity? Should I buy special winter clothes or will jeans and a couple of extra layers suffice?</p>  <p>I should add that my budget is very tight so I wouldn't mind a second-hand jacket or coat and I would definitely prefer to buy my winter stuff in Georgia. Does that mean I'd end up with cheap and old but good leather/fur as opposed to expensive and new and good hi-tech western stuff?</p>  <p>There's <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2643/winter-apparel-for-europe-nov-dec-11">a similar question about a short visit to western Europe</a> but I don't think my question about a long stay in the Caucasus is a duplicate.</p>

However, am in Khorog, Tajikistan, and there's NONE in town, and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country, save for the 5 tablets in my bag.</p>  <p>My question is, <strong>what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for (NZ passport), which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin</strong>.</p>  <p>I have an entry visa for Russia if need be - if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...</p>

3748	Flying with a desktop computer (as checked luggage)	<p>On an upcoming trip, I will be taking a desktop computer and monitor as checked luggage (on a United/Continental flight). What should I be aware of when doing this? What needs to be done to properly protect all the components? Are there any airline policies I should be aware of?</p> 
3624	Are there ways to call "international" toll-free phone numbers?	<p>I just had a lot of grief changing a plane ticket from a somewhat exotic location.</p>  <p>It involved calling with Skype from Tbilisi Georgia to the nearest office for my airline in Istanbul Turkey.</p>  <p>It turned out the office's booking system for the airline was having some trouble but he told me I could call the airline direct on a toll-free number. He assured me it would work even though I didn't expect such things to work internationally.</p>  <p>I tried using Skype and I tried using a Georgian mobile phone. I couldn't get either to work.</p>  <p>So that's the back story. The actual question is <strong>Is there a way to call "international" toll-free phone numbers?</strong></p>  <p>The reason for the scare quotes on "international" is because it's a vague term. It may mean either of these things:</p>  <ul> <li>Something like <strong>800 / 0 800 / 1 800</strong> numbers that can be called from any country.</li> <li>Toll-free number in country A that can be called even if you're in country B. In which case you'd need to use the country code as well as the <strong>800 / 0 800 / 1 800</strong> part somehow.</li> </ul> 
2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
232	How can I protect camera equipment in checked baggage?	<p>While I usually take my camera equipment in a carry-on when I fly (within the US), that's not always an option (small plane where no carry-on other than my purse is allowed, travelling with too much computer/camera equipment to carry it all on, etc.).</p>  <p>Last time I checked my camera equipment, it was put back in the case incorrectly after (I assume) being searched, causing some very serious breakage.  While "that's what insurance is for" certainly applies, having to try to replace a camera on short notice during a trip is an inconvenience I'd rather avoid.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can check something this delicate/valuable without it being destroyed?  If not, can I at least reduce the chance of major damage somehow?</p>  <p><strong>Clarification:</strong><br> I already have a good camera case.  The problem happened when airport personnel couldn't be bothered to put the camera back properly (I assume the case was searched after I checked it) and instead ripped some of the padded dividers out, crammed them into another part of the case, and wedged the camera in the wrong way.  Without any padding to keep it from moving, and wedged against the side of the case as it was, the camera broke during what may have been normal baggage handling during transportation.</p> 
1340	Where is wild camping possible in Europe?	<p>Are there countries in Europe where wild camping with a tent allowed or at least tolerated? How high is the probability that someone will get angry at you or even call the police? </p>  <p>Please consider only cases where the travellers would be using common sense - not making noise, leaving no trace behind, staying out of sight of roads and houses, etc. In our case, the tent is small and easy to hide (dark green) and we won't need a camp fire.</p>

447	Do you need to submit an itinerary to get a Russian visa? And do you have to stick to it?	<p>I believe there are certain countries which in order to be granted a visa you must submit your intended itinerary. I am pretty sure I've heard Russia is or was formerly such a country.</p>  <p>What do independent travellers do? I've been thinking of hitch-hiking across Russia without a precise plan and a friend of mine has wanted to do a road trip across Russia also without an exact plan.</p>  <p>Is this a no-brainer or is there lots of red tape we would have to deal with? Or is it just official-speak / bureaucracy where they make it look complicated but in practice it turns out to be easy?</p> 
3040	Do I need a visa if I go with a cruise line to St. Petersburg?	<p>Last week I discussed with a friend if it is necessary to get a Russian visa if you travel with a cruise liner to Saint Petersburg in Russia? I think so, but my friend has the opinion that it is not necessary since you're accomondation is not in Russia but on the "international" cruise line. Who is right?</p>  <p>I have to edit my question to clarify something: I'm not asking if I need to care about the visa by myself or if the tour operator does it. I already did that this summer and I know it can be a PITA. I want to know if I need a Visa at all. </p>

3924	Where can someone see flowing lava at roughly Easter time?	<p>A trip is being planned at roughly Easter 2012 (to match school schedules) that can go anywhere in the world as long it meets these two criteria:</p>  <ul> <li>there is flowing lava you can see (not just cooled flows, not just smoke/steam)</li> <li>it is not Hawaii</li> </ul>  <p>Suggestions? This is a trip being planned in advance, not a "hey XYZ is erupting, call the travel agent" situation.</p>  <p>Bonus marks if the area is archeologically significant -- the adults planning the trip are both working archeologists so that would make the location even more desirable. And of course being a generally nice place with things to do other than look at the lava.</p> 
3984	What do "Fragile" stickers on checked baggage do?	<p>When traveling by air and checking bags, some airlines will let you declare an item as fragile and put stickers on the box or bag. How common is this policy? What do the fragile stickers do (i.e. how do they change the baggage handling process)? Is this generally recommended when traveling with fragile luggage (to avoid items being damaged in transit) or discouraged (because it may make an item a bigger target for theft)?</p>

Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
2615	Where can I find and book plane tickets on date not on destination?	<p>I have a holiday coming up and I would like to travel with the family somewhere. I have specific wishes regarding departure and arrival times, but the destination is less relevant. Where can I search on date and departure/arrival times for possible destinations?</p>

730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p>

3507	How to get a visa for Iran	<p>Most Westerners do not only need a visa to visit Iran, they first need a "Letter of Invitation" to be able to apply for the visa.  Most people get this through travel or special visa agencies, some of them are online only.</p>  <p>What are any trustworthy agencies that do this? Experiences in quality and duration?</p> 
4292	Can you get married while traveling?	<p>As a traveler getting married while traveling must be the ultimate experience. Can you actually legally get married while traveling? </p> 
4296	Can the ship's captain really perform your wedding when in international waters?	<p>On <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/4292/can-you-get-married-while-traveling">the question about whether you can get married while travelling</a>, Mark Mayo posted a comment that any marriage has to be on dry land or close to it.</p>  <p>But I'm sure all of us have heard of ships' captains marrying couples at sea.</p>  <p>From the movie <strong><em>Casablanca</em></strong>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?<br>   ...<br>   Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?<br>   ...<br>   Well, why not? <strong>The captain on a ship can</strong>. It doesn't seem fair that... </p> </blockquote>  <p>So is this fiction after all? If not how does it fit with Mark's comment? What special rules and such should we know?</p>  <p><strong>If I'm travelling at sea with a significant other and wish to tie the knot, can we do so with any captain on any ship on any sea? Must it be international waters?</strong></p> 
248	Avoiding air travel sickness without Dramamine/Dimenhydrinate or other drugs	<p>My wife is very prone to motion sickness, especially on air flights.  In the past we've handled this with Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate), which helped quite a bit.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, my wife's reaction to the Dramamine was invariably to fall into a deep, groggy sleep for the duration of the flight.  This is her reaction to most antihistamines. </p>  <p>We're planning on taking a trip to Europe next year, and I'm concerned about the idea of essentially drugging her into unconsciousness for the duration of an extended overseas flight.</p>  <p>Is there any other recourse to prevent motion sickness that would be effective for a long haul (7+ hours) flight?</p> 
4330	Getting nauseated from air travel, but it's *not* motion sickness...what to do?	<p>My sister is not particularly inclined to air travel—she regularly throws up, and the feeling of nausea is evident well before motion sickness could occur (i.e. inside the terminal). </p>  <p>I suspect some of it is due to a reverse-placebo psychological effect—she likely associated motion sickness with airports/airplanes/air travel at an early age and it's unfortunately carried through. It's probably not entirely the odor of burnt jet-fuel (although she does mention that as contributing) since she's fine when she's going to the airport to say bye to relatives. </p>  <p>Also of note—my sister is only 11 years old, so that limits what can be done to help her as far as medication is concerned.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, neither Dramamine, Benadryl, nor Sea-Bands have been of any help, as we discovered two days ago. We're going to consult her doctor when we get back to the US, but the slight problem with that is that there is a 12 hour plane ride back to the US, and the preferable option would be to go back with as little vomit as possible.</p>  <p>What could be done to help alleviate her nausea?</p> 
4308	What is the most comfortable way to sleep on a plane?	<p>Some people have the amazing ability to doze off whenever and wherever they are. For the rest of us, sleeping on planes is a constant battle of trying to get comfortable in a cramped space. There are lots of options: special pillows, leaning against the window, folding over flaps on the headrest, leaning on the shoulder of a friend next to you, etc. Certainly something must work...</p>  <p>What have you found to be the best way to comfortably sleep on a plane (in a standard economy seat; first class is a whole different world)?</p> 
2993	Additional cabin handbag on flights	<p>It's quite common, that in addition to cabin size hand baggage you can take also smaller bag like handbag or small laptop case to the plane. I'm interested in knowing if someone hasn't been allowed to take average size laptop bag as an additional "handbag". Is this usual?</p> 
2589	How to prevent "Delhi Belly"?	<p><em>Montezuma's revenge</em>, <em>Aztec two step</em>, <em>mummy's tummy</em>, or <em>Cairo two-step</em> in Egypt, <em>Kurtz Hurtz</em> in Uzbekistan, <em>Bombay belly</em> or <em>Delhi belly</em> in India.</p>  <p><em>A case of the sh--</em> or <em>Hershey Squirts</em> or <em>The McSh--</em> in North America, <em>Down Under Butt Chunder</em> in Australia, <em>Karachi crouch</em> in Pakistan, <em>Suryavarman's Revenge</em> in Cambodia.</p>  <p><em>Kabulitis</em> in Afghanistan, <em>holiday tummy</em> in United Kingdom, <em>Bali belly</em> in Bali, or <em>Taghazout Tummy</em> in Taghazout or <em>Kathmandu quickstep</em> in Nepal.</p>  <p><em>Beaver fever</em> in Canada, Thailand it's <em>Thai-dal wave</em>. Peacekeepers to Arabic-speaking countries have called it <em>yalla yalla</em> (Arabic for "fast, fast").</p>  <p>In Central Asia, it was ridiculous, with every second backpacker walking around with toilet paper on them, regularly having to make a 'run' for it. In Egypt, half my tour group got sick, by the time we'd converted into a mobile pharmacy!</p>  <p><strong>Regardless of what it's called, what's the best way to try and prevent it?</strong></p> 
3924	Where can someone see flowing lava at roughly Easter time?	<p>A trip is being planned at roughly Easter 2012 (to match school schedules) that can go anywhere in the world as long it meets these two criteria:</p>  <ul> <li>there is flowing lava you can see (not just cooled flows, not just smoke/steam)</li> <li>it is not Hawaii</li> </ul>  <p>Suggestions? This is a trip being planned in advance, not a "hey XYZ is erupting, call the travel agent" situation.</p>  <p>Bonus marks if the area is archeologically significant -- the adults planning the trip are both working archeologists so that would make the location even more desirable. And of course being a generally nice place with things to do other than look at the lava.</p> 
31	Sightseeing the USA by air	<p>The next time family from overseas comes to visit me in the USA, I would like for them to see the major sites in the USA.</p>  <p>Is there such a thing as a prepaid flying tour of the USA?</p> 
2796	Long term travel without being wealthy - how is it possible?	<p>Some people are practically most of the time traveling, from country to country, for a very long periods and sometimes even years. </p>  <p>How could one be able to travel for a long period of time, over several countries around the world, without being wealthy?</p> 
26	What should I know about "Around The World" flights?	<p>I have heard rumours of such things, and have had a difficult time find information on "around the world" flights.  Are they worth it (do you have a limit between usage, do you save money.. etc.) and are there easy ways of getting more informed on them (specific sites, travel agencies)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> With the goal of maximum continental coverage, no specific start or finish locations</p> 
2026	Couldn't return papers to border officials last time. Should I be afraid when going back to USA?	<p>Three years ago I was on holidays in Canada and visited the Niagara Falls. I also went to the American side of the falls and got something like a "short-term visa". I also got a green paper with all my information (name, passport number, etc.) which I should give back at the border when leaving USA again.</p>  <p>When I got back from the USA side of the falls, the border was abandoned. Therefore I couldn't give the green paper back to the officials. Now I'm really a bit afraid that in their computer system I still haven't left the USA.</p>  <p>Next summer I plan to visit USA again. Can I get into trouble at the border?</p> 
3521	5 hours in Amsterdam	<p>I have a 5-hour layover at AMS on a Saturday evening (16:00-21:00), on an intra-EU itinerary to the UK.  I'd like to leave the airport and have dinner in town. </p>  <ul> <li>Is this reasonable?  (From reading the travel wiki article, it looks like this is plenty of time to take the train into the city and back.)</li> <li>Ideally I would like to find a restaurant that is popular, not expensive, and <strong>quintessentially Dutch</strong> (i.e. traditional).  I am looking for restaurant recommendations in particular, or recommendations on where to find decent recommendations. (The travel wiki article's 'eating' listings are pretty sparse.)</li> </ul> 
250	Which European cities have bike rental stations for tourists?	<p>During my last vacation in Barcelona I found out that some bicycle stations are made for citizens, where they can pick up a bike, ride on it to the other station, and leave it there. Unfortunately, this was not available for guests of the city.<br> Are there any cities in Europe I can pick up bicycle for my needs for a short time?</p> 
4290	How to plan celebrating carnaval in Rio?	<p>If you are not from Brazil and you want to celebrate carnival in Rio, what should you do? Do you just buy a ticket to Rio, book any hotel and just enjoy? Or is that a recipe for failure? I can imagine that if you don't know the spots you might end up in a very unfavorable position where you are actually there but you get completely lost in the crowds. Are there tours and are they worth considering? </p> 
1860	What is the state of train travel in USA?	<p>I'm planning to go to the USA for some months. I'd like to travel there by train, but I heard that trains aren't really widely used in USA. So my questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>How is the rail network in the USA? Is it possible to reach the big cities and also some smaller sights in a feasible amount of time?</li> <li>Is there a train ticket that allows an unlimited use of all trains?</li> </ul> 
2720	Is it really forbidden to cross the Indian border with Indian rupee?	<p>Last week I tried to exchange some Swiss Francs into Indian rupees. For that I visited a big bank and they told me that they have rupees but I'm not allowed to import any into India. Is this really true?</p>  <p>And if so, what's the reason behind such a law?</p>  <p>P.S. The bank also told me that in practice it isn't a problem if you take money below 200 Swiss Francs into the country.</p> 
1023	Is it possible to recharge an OV-chipkaart without a Dutch banking card?	<p>I have an anonymous <a href="http://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/" rel="nofollow">OV-chipkaart</a> (Dutch public transport electronic card). I don't have a Dutch banking card. (In other words, I'm a foreigner who goes to the Netherlands occasionally.) What are my options to recharge the OV-chipkaart, either with cash (ideally banknotes) or with a credit card?</p>  <p>Would getting a nominative card enable me to recharge it through the website without a Dutch banking card?</p>

4420	What happens if you get malaria?	<p>This may be more of a health question than a travel question, but it definitely applies to travelers to many parts of the world. If someone gets malaria (either through not taking preventative pills or because they don't stop a particular infection), what are the consequences? In countries with decent medical care, is it simply a matter of taking anti-malarial pills as treatment until the infection is gone? Or is malaria, as some have told me, a lifelong infection that will chronically recur once it has infected someone?</p>  <p>Or, to put it another way, in travel destinations where malaria risk is borderline, is it very important to take preventative measures to avoid serious consequences, or is the disease not serious and easily treatable as long as you have access to good health care?</p> 
983	Can I get warfarin in Tajikistan (or nearby?)	<p>I've run into a major problem, requiring urgent Warfarin.  However, am in Khorog, Tajikistan, and there's NONE in town, and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country, save for the 5 tablets in my bag.</p>  <p>My question is, <strong>what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for (NZ passport), which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin</strong>.</p>  <p>I have an entry visa for Russia if need be - if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...</p>

2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
4757	Travel pass in London	    <p>In February 2012 I'll spend  days in London (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday). I'll have to travel from Heathrow to the city center and back. Additionally, I'll be using the subway all five days and I'm also planning to go for some more remote areas, like Richmond park. Is there any travel pass available that allows me to use all public transport in this area for this time period? Or what is the cheapest options for my plans? (If it does matter, I'm a student).</p> 
2807	What is the actual price of hiring a porter for Everest base camp?	<p>I know hiring a guide/porter is not required for the Everest Case Camp hike, but I think it is a good way to add something to the local economy. I am considering getting hiring a porter for this hike. <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Everest_Base_Camp_Trek">Wikitravel</a> says you can expect to pay <em>Rs 1200-1600</em> a day.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any actual experience hiring a porter in this situation? What did you actually pay? Where did you find them?</p>  <p>I am trying to budget out a trip ahead of time and <em>Rs 1200</em> is a big expense at the end of the day for a backpacker.</p> 
2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>". In one <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa/1214#1214">answer</a> it is said that "international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible". The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p> 
1930	Does an EU citizen need a visa to visit Australia for holidays?	<p>Is a visa required, or is just a passport enough, for a short holiday trip to Australia? </p>  <p>Specifically, how is it for citizens of Nordic EU member countries such as Finland? </p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p> 
203	How do you avoid "tourist traps" when traveling to a country where you do not speak the language?	<p>Too many easily accessible restaurants and attractions cater heavily to tourists, and, in doing so, create an environment that they feel will be comfortable to people from other cultures.  </p>  <p>Spending too much time in these locations sometimes leads with only a superficial understanding of the culture.  This is especially difficult when you do not speak the local language.</p>  <p>For travelers who want to learn as much about the authentic culture and day-to-day lives of the people in the areas they are vacationing in, what are some techniques for avoiding the heavily tourist-oriented attractions?  How do you work around the language barrier?  How do you avoid areas that are unsafe?</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
4800	Cost of jeep / 4WD tours in Wadi Rum	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mfWqB.jpg" alt="Wadi Rum"></p>  <p>Photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamreeder/5372963888/in/photostream/">Adam Reeder</a></p>  <p>Wadi Rum seems to be quite an other-worldy place from pictures I've seen. Unfortunately, it's the sort of place that I cannot see on foot and as a budget traveller, I'd need to go on an organised tour to see the sights (hiring a private car would be prohibitively expensive!). I've searched online and most sites quote prices for jeep tours with an overnight stay at a Bedouin camp which costs 35-60 JOD.</p>  <p>I'm not interested in the overnight Bedouin experience. Are there any organised tours half/full day just on a jeep, and how much do they cost for a solo traveller?</p> 
4360	Is there an equivalent to "The Man in Seat Sixty-One" for bus travel?	<p>Whenever I want to learn about train travel for a specific country of region I first go to the site <a href="http://www.seat61.com">The Man in seat sixty-one</a>. It lists the major routes, railway companies and describes rolling stock as well as having timetable and price information.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, sometimes there are no trains and one has to take a coach (overland bus). Is there a site out there that covers bus travel around the world in a similar way to Seat61?</p> 
4245	Avoiding or minimising altitude sickness?	<p>From my personal anecdotal experience, I've seen first-hand some horror stories with altitude sickness.  I will always tell people now to acclimatise, drink fluids, and follow the local tricks like chewing coca leaves in Bolivia.  However, as far as I'm aware, the only "cure" for it is still to come down to a lower altitude (or pressure chamber).</p>  <p>For the most part, it doesn't matter how fit or healthy you are - it is seemingly random who it affects, and you can be fine one time and terrible the next.</p>  <p>I've been lucky myself to only ever get a little dizzy, out of breath and have headaches, and that's in several trips over 4000m.</p>  <p>What do you use to avoid altitude sickness, or have you seen methods which serve to delay the effects, avoid symptoms or generally get through it OK?</p> 
4502	Do long-distances buses run overnight in any country in Central America?	<p>I've travelled quite a bit in both Mexico and Central America before but whereas in Mexico I could often take a bus any time in the night and wee hours of the morning, I can't recall ever seeing such options in any country in Central America.</p>  <p>Was this just because I was travelling by chicken buses or do even the luxury coaches travel only during daylight in Central America?</p> 
995	What happens when a foreigner gets a traffic fine in the United States?	<p>What happens when a foreigner gets a speeding ticket / traffic fine in the United States? I've heard that the issuing officer will demand payment on site or will confiscate the drivers license.  That sounds a little too extreme to be true but on the other hand I'm not sure how they would enforce punishment for these infractions on people who can just leave the country.</p> 
3330	Do I have to pay traffic fines issued by foreign governments?	<p>I live in Italy and I own a car registered in Italy as well.</p>  <p>Next year I'm planning a long stay in the US (around 6 months) and I want to bring my car with me.</p>  <p>I was wondering, can I abuse carpool lanes, not pay parking spaces, break the speed limit etc etc with no consequences (while still driving safely ofc)?</p>  <p>If they give me a fine, is it just trash paper or can they somehow force me to pay?</p>  <p>(What I want to avoid is basically going back to the US 20 years from now and getting arrested for that, or something similar)</p> 
3838	Are there companies that offer worldwide wifi roaming for a fixed fee?	<p>I am aware of the following related question: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2975/overview-of-wireless-in-airports">Overview of wireless in airports</a>. If it is free it would be nice, but I am willing to pay for my Internet access at airports/hotels. The only problem is that it is often a hassle to get access at these accesspoints. I don't like adding cc details to website when I am at a terminal building of an airport.  Since I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.fon.com">FON</a>, where you share Internet access with fellow members worldwide, I am wondering if there is such "roaming" service for wifi access. At many airports you see that they offer access to partners. </p>  <p>So, my question is, if there is a company which offers worldwide wifi roaming services for a fixed fee?</p> 
1407	Is there a resource to find free, open wifi hotspots?	<p>It would be great to know where free, publicly accessible (municipal or otherwise) hotspots are when travelling in foreign cities. Does such a utility exist (website/app etc.)? </p> 
2736	Choices for prepaid GSM data with laptop tethering in Europe?	<p>Planning a trip to Europe later this year that will definitely include Italy, and will most likely include the UK, Germany, and a smattering of connecting and/or distractingly shiny countries. Here in the US, I have both a 4G and 3G mifi and it would be nifty to keep that kind of connectivity while I'm traveling. Both of those gizmos are US-only. My connectivity affects my ability to work while traveling, so it's no exaggeration to say that I'll stay an extra month if I can solve this issue.</p>  <p>I know the trick of landing with an unlocked phone and shoving in a local SIM card, but it's a pain to figure out tethering options for my laptop, which is my #1 priority. (#2 priority: Google Maps.) Are there no-contract providers for this kind of usage?</p>  <p>Question 1a) Alternately, are there EU grace periods for returning a phone and getting a refund? In the US, you get 14 days to return a cell phone.</p>  <p>1b) If the answer to the above is "no", as it would be in the US, are there better options for widespread wifi hookups than Boingo?</p> 
788	How can I travel to Germany with my dog?	<p>I will be traveling to Germany (from the USA) in a few months and hope to bring my dog, a 10 lb Chihuahua-mix.  I would like to do this with a minimum of difficulty, so I am hoping to hear the experiences of others who have done this in order to avoid any pitfalls.</p>  <p>My understanding is that it is necessary to have the dog microchipped and then re-vaccinated against rabies, and have the vet sign a form giving the microchip number and details of the vaccination.  (There is a handy <a href="http://www.zoll.de/english_version/faq/a0_passenger_traffic/d0_pets/index.html">FAQ from the German customs authority</a> which gives the general picture.)</p>  <ul> <li>How long before travel do I need to have the rabies vaccine and microchip done?</li> <li><strong>Is the signature of my vet sufficiently "official"?</strong>  Some other website mentioned getting an approval from the USDA.</li> <li><strong>Is a particular kind of microchip required or recommended?</strong>  I know there are several different microchip systems.</li> <li>Are there any other particular pitfalls to avoid?  For instance, I assume I will have to avoid traveling via Ireland or the UK to get there.</li> </ul> 
4439	How to insure professional equipment while traveling	<p>What are my options, as a U.S. citizen, for insuring professional equipment (camera and laptop, specifically) while traveling outside of the U.S.?  Most of the traveler's insurance policies I've found have a very low coverage for personal items (usually $500 to $1000; the highest being $3000).  This makes me wonder if there are better options specifically for covering damage or theft of such equipment.  Lets say the equipment I carry with me has a new value of up to US$10,000.</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
2624	Is it safe to travel to Egypt in early 2012?	<p>Have people been travelling in Egypt after March 2011?  What's the situation like over there?  The election is also happening at the end of November.  Should I wait until after the election to book my tour?  I'm planning to visit early 2012.</p> 
965	Using an Amazon Kindle onboard a flight?	<p>Airlines don't let you use electronic devices when the plane is taking off/landing. Let's suppose I have a Kindle 3, and I have turned off wireless (i.e. both Wifi and GSM/3G is off). </p>  <p>Since you don't need power or the battery to read what's on the screen (the magic of eInk displays), it's technically 'off' when I'm reading it, right? </p>  <p>Can I still use it when the flight is taking off? Have any national aviation authorities passed judgement on this?</p> 
5065	What is the longest passenger flight (with a flight number) in the world?	<p>For example, JQ151 from Sydney to Christchurch is around 3 hours.  NZ1 however, is about another 7 to Hong Kong.</p>  <p>Will need a regular flight number to verify.</p>  <p>Definition is longest in terms of flight time / distance (they should be linked, logically?).</p> 
5064	What is the shortest commercial passenger flight (with a flight number) in the world?	<p>With the occasional debate about Oxford airport in the UK becoming a new London airport, and hearing of a flight that once landed at Heathrow due to fog, then flew on to Gatwick, I was wondering - what is the shortest (time) regular (ie I can look it up online and book a ticket) passenger flight in the world?  I'd specify distance as well, but in theory that shouldn't matter?</p> 
4280	What foods must I try while visiting Australia?	<p>I will be traveling to Cairns, Brisbane, and Sydney and was wondering what are the must try foods/dishes I should get while there.</p> 
610	Is tea and coffee on the street safe to drink in India?	<p>There are many street tea/coffee sellers around India, and although the water has been boiled at some point, often the pots are out for a long time. The clay cups are also lying around in the dust. Is it safe to drink?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fcjVK.jpg" alt="Chai Seller Courtesy of Proxy Indian"> <em>Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/proxyindian/">Proxy Indian</a></em></p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
3485	What are the best places to eat and have fun in Aruba?	<p>I'm going to <strong>Aruba</strong> in December and I'd like to know the best place to eat considering the relationship price/quality. </p>  <p>I'd also would like to know what other fun activities you recommend (besides going to the beach, watersports, snorkeling, etc) Any other tip about this island would also be very welcome!</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
1911	Should I change most of my money in my home country or in the destination country?	<p>Where can I get more favourable exchange rate, in general?</p> 
2305	Maximum validity of a Schengen visa for multiple visits	<p>My dodgy Colombian friend has a Schengen visa which is valid for 5 years.  It is a multiple entry visa but it also says you are permitted 90 days in the Schengen zone.</p>  <p>Is this 90 days total in 5 years, or is it 90 days from the date of initial entry into the zone?</p> 
885	French rules for long stay visa: OFII	<p>I was looking for somebody to guide me about the OFII rules catering to the French long stay visa.</p>  <p>I'm going as an exchange student to Nimes, France from Delhi, India. As my stay is over 90 days, I need to get the long stay visa. For this, I also need to get the OFII stamp on my passport from the prefecture of my department which is in Montpellier. Getting the OFII stamp is mandatory.</p>  <p>My question is: can I travel to Spain for La Tomatina or Germany for the Oktoberfest if I don't get the OFII stamp on my passport till then. I have heard that the borders are open and there's hardly any checking.</p> 
722	Which credit cards have global coverage?	<p>While traveling I ran into two situations where my credit card was not accepted. I mainly use MasterCard. In China (although 10 years ago) Visa was accepted in most stores, but MasterCard was not. In the US, my MasterCard was rejected multiple times because it was a non-US CC number. This can be a real annoyance. </p>  <p>So could anyone recommend me a CC company which would give me global coverage? Or is this just not possible?</p> 
5161	Are there any trains where roof riding is legally possible?	<p>I just read an <a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/train-roof-riders-deterred-by-balls-kai/493169">article</a> about the Indonesian railways, where they put low hanging  concrete balls above railroad tracks to deter train rooftop riders. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3KCdc.jpg" alt="Roof riders in Burma, photo by Peter Hahndorf"></p>  <p>Roof riding is common on certain trains in Indonesia, but it is illegal. </p>  <p>In Burma people also did it, but they wouldn't let us go up on the roof. What about India?</p>  <p>It was also popular on the tourist trains in Ecuador, but after two people cut their heads off a while ago, they are now very strict about this. </p>  <p>So are there any trains where you are actually allowed to ride on the roof? And how dangerous is it assuming there are no concrete balls in the way?</p> 
2720	Is it really forbidden to cross the Indian border with Indian rupee?	<p>Last week I tried to exchange some Swiss Francs into Indian rupees. For that I visited a big bank and they told me that they have rupees but I'm not allowed to import any into India. Is this really true?</p>  <p>And if so, what's the reason behind such a law?</p>  <p>P.S. The bank also told me that in practice it isn't a problem if you take money below 200 Swiss Francs into the country.</p> 
3965	Can I learn ski jumping in Japan?	<p>Since visiting Calgary Olympic Park and seeing their exhibit on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jumping">ski jumping</a> within the ski jumping tower, I've wanted to have a go at the sport, and Japan is the closest country to me (along with South Korea) that's into the sport.</p>  <p>Currently I know that lots of Japanese <a href="http://www.snowjapanforums.com/index.php/topic/20665-nordic-ski-jumping-lessons-in-japan/page__view__findpost__p__418185">schoolkids</a> learn ski jumping, and that English-language tourism sites mention ski jumping hills as sightseeing attractions (eg <a href="http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/hokkaido/sapporo_ski_jump.html">Okurayama in Sapporo</a> and <a href="http://www.vill.hakuba.nagano.jp/~us/attractions-olympic-facilities.html">Hakuba</a>).</p>  <p>What I don't know is whether it's possible to book ski jumping lessons (as in take lessons in the middle of the season for a week or so as part of a trip to Japan), or whether you'd have to be part of a sports club that operates for a whole season.</p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be any information in English about learning ski jumping in Japan, but maybe that's because people assume foreigners aren't interested in it.</p>  <p>Answers describing specific locations outside of Japan where it's possible to learn ski jumping are also welcome.</p> 
3198	How many countries are there in the world to travel to?	<p>If you've travelled a bit, at some point you'll either have dreamed of or been asked - 'will you visit every country in the world?'.  However, it's not a straightforward goal to aim for...</p>  <p>I've heard much debate on this.  Is Kosovo a country? Not according to the U.N.!  Is Gibraltar a country? Do you separate England, Scotland and Wales?  Is French Guyana a part of France?</p>  <p>Chris Guillebeau, one of the most well known travellers and country counters, has over <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/places-ive-been/" rel="nofollow">160 countries under his belt</a>.  Of course, as you travel you realise it becomes harder and harder to define what IS a country...</p>  <p><em><strong>bonus:</em></strong></p>  <p>And so, for the country counters or just those who may have a definitive answer (with references please) - how many countries are there in the world that you would consider you have travelled to, if you'd been to all of them?</p> 
3492	What is the most efficient way to pack a bag?	<p>On trips of four days or less, I try to travel with a shoulder bag containing my laptop, electronics, etc. and a rolling, carry-on bag for everything else. </p>  <p>What is the best technique for packing as much clothing as reasonably possible into a standard-sized, rolling, carry-on bag?  I don't want to overpack the bag doing something ridiculous or have any difficulty getting the bag in and out of an airline's standard overhead bin.  Currently, I use a trick someone showed me where I stack several like items and then fold them together.  It seems to pack them tighter and prevent creases from folding.  Is there a better way? </p>  <p>I'm especially interested in tricks for packing shoes and jackets.  I am a runner and my running shoes always seem to take up too much space.  Jackets also never seem to be fold down efficiently.</p> 
185	Is there a list of free accomodation resources?	<p>I want to travel abroad cheap, and I would prefer to find some place to stay through a person or website, rather than book a hotel or hostel. There is <a href="http://couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a>, which I know about. Can you recommend other resources where I can find free accomodation?</p>

4835	Which Indian trains have shorter booking period?	<p>Most of the long distance trains in India have bookings opened 90 days before the train ride. There are some that have a shorter period available.</p>  <p>Which exact Indian trains have reservations open only 30 day prior to departure?</p>

4983	Where to go in Morocco with toddlers?	<p>We would like to go to Morocco. It seems like a very interesting destination. Unfortunately most travel guides suggest traveling with children over 6. Should we postpone visiting Morocco until they are six? If not what are the best parts of Morocco we should visit with our twin toddlers of three?</p> 
823	Which chateaux of the Loire are worth visiting?	<p>When visiting France, one of the great things to see are the Chateaux of the Loire Valley. An hour by TGV from Paris, yet a world apart, with stunning grand palatial castles in beautiful scenery, it's certainly somewhere to visit.</p>  <p>If you check most guidebooks, they all seem to agree on two Chateaux to visit. Firstly there's the Château de Chambord, an impressive Renaissance masterpiece that's the largest of the Loire Chateau.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QNc9P.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:France_Loir-et-Cher_Chambord_Chateau_03.jpg"></p>  <p>The other that everyone seems to agree on is the Château de Chenonceau. While smaller, the rooms, tapestries, furniture and artworks are stunning, and you visit as much for the contents as the building itself. There are some very nice gardens too.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nky8B.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chateau_de_Chenonceau_2008E.jpg"></p>  <p>Having visited these two last year (along with a couple of others), I'm keen to see a few more this year. The problem is that most guidebooks either seem to stop after just a few, or go on to list several hundred, without the middle ground.</p>  <p>My question therefore is what other Chateaux of the mid Loire (roughly Angers to Tours)  should one try to see (beyond the obvious two of Chenonceau and Chambord), and why?</p> 
189	How good is Public Transport In the USA?	<p>I am planning a Round-the-World trip and my first stop will be the USA. I am from England where public transport is quite good and covers everywhere. I have already purchased Greyhound tickets for inter-city travel, so my main question is how good is the public transport in the cities and what sort of prices should I expect? Can you get weekly travel passes that allow you to travel unlimited amount of times on Public Transport? I am doing my trip on a backpacker's budget, so I am looking for the cheapest method of transport.</p>  <p>The cities I am planning on visiting are:</p>  <ul> <li>Washington </li> <li>Philladelphia</li> <li>New York</li> <li>Niagara</li> <li>Chicago</li> <li>Las Vegas</li> <li>Los Angeles</li> <li>San Diego</li> </ul>  <p>Are there particular types of transport that are better in particular cities i.e. Bus in one city but subway in another?</p> 
5282	Can I buy malaria medication in India?	<p>In question '<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/497/1317">Is it necessary to take malaria pills when travelling in South India?</a>' we discussed whether it is necessary to take any medication. So if one has decided to take the pills, is it possible to buy them in India rather than buying them at home? If so, are all different types available and how much are they?</p>  <p>For my last trip in South East Asia I bought a good bunch of mefloquine pills in London for a lot of money. Because I stayed longer than planned and run out of them eventually, I had to buy more locally and there were much cheaper in SEA. (Yes, I do think they were the real thing!)</p>

5312	How to successfully haggle / bargain in markets	<p>While I've done quite a bit of travel now and back myself to handle situations when it comes to border guards, sorting accommodation and / or transportation, one thing I still struggle to come to terms with is haggling in the markets, be it for food, clothing or other.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FImXq.jpg" alt="Image of haggling in a market"></p>  <p>Image © Peter Morgan, 2014 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356</a></p>  <p>What is the best way to go about this? I'm generally either worried I'll offend them, or that they're trying to rip me off anyway, so it's a weird combination of awkwardness inside my head ;)</p> 
5193	Best way to make my ears pop?	<p>What is the best way to make my ears pop when landing on a plane? The hold-your-nose-and-pitch method is very painful; are there any other methods to pop ears?</p> 
4213	Last minute flight bookings - better to book online or at the airport?	<p>We had <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2952/108">a question here earlier on booking flight tickets in the weeks running up to holiday season</a>, which covered ground on what happens to flight prices over the period.</p>  <p>What I'm interested to know is if I had to fly out at short notice, say within 1-2 days, then am I better off booking within that 1-2 day gap online, or am I better off trying my luck directly at the airport (as long as I'm willing to wait at the airport) for a cheaper price? Is there any truth to rumours that airlines sell tickets at cheaper prices at the airport right before flights to fill empty seats or is that a myth?</p> 
5414	Why do I feel pressure in the ears in a plane?	<p>Normally you feel pressure in your ear, if the air pressure changes, e.g. if you're ascending or descending very fast. But why do I feel this pressure also in airplanes where the pressure in the passenger room should be constant?</p> 
589	Motorbikes in Thailand and Laos	<p>Does anyone know of a place to hire motorbikes in Thailand, say Bangkok or Chiang Mai, and ride them into Laos and back? The trip will be self-guided and should take no longer than two weeks.</p> 
4253	How to get to Christmas Island?	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island">Christmas Island</a> is an island of Australia far off the northwest of the mainland, much closer to Indonesia.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AGMuD.png" alt="Where is Christmas Island?"><br> <sup>(Thanks to Wikimedia Commons for the map)</sup></p>  <p>I know I can fly there but <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Christmas_Island#By_boat">Wikitravel seems to suggest there's no regular ferry or boat transport</a>.</p>  <p>It does mention that I might be able to get there by private yacht or by cruise ship. Does anybody have some actual information about how to find either of these and how much it might cost?</p>  <p>I'd like to know both about getting there (or back) from Australia and from Indonesia. Would one be easier than the other? Would customs and immigrations rules make the latter too tricky? Would it be a good way to get from Australia to Southeast Asia overland?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.

26	What should I know about "Around The World" flights?	<p>I have heard rumours of such things, and have had a difficult time find information on "around the world" flights.  Are they worth it (do you have a limit between usage, do you save money.. etc.) and are there easy ways of getting more informed on them (specific sites, travel agencies)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> With the goal of maximum continental coverage, no specific start or finish locations</p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p>

890	Is there any trick to checking in more weight on planes?	<p>I soon have to move from France to Spain, one way no coming back. And as with most of the airlines carriers in Europe I am allowed at 23Kg checked-in and 10Kg on board with me. Packing lifetime stuff in 33Kg is not an easy task.</p>  <p>I was wondering if some of you have trick to either check in more weight or any other trick so they can go with more kilos.</p>

545	Traveling to USA with tripod attached to my camera bag	<p>I like to travel with my DSLR and I have nice slingshot bag for it which I can take with me on the plane along with my carry on. This <a href="http://img2.fengniao.com/product/33/94/ceb0ZMiwEAVl2.jpg" rel="nofollow">picture</a> shows what I want to do while boarding the plane. Would it be OK/legal for me while flying from Canada to USA?</p> 
232	How can I protect camera equipment in checked baggage?	<p>While I usually take my camera equipment in a carry-on when I fly (within the US), that's not always an option (small plane where no carry-on other than my purse is allowed, travelling with too much computer/camera equipment to carry it all on, etc.).</p>  <p>Last time I checked my camera equipment, it was put back in the case incorrectly after (I assume) being searched, causing some very serious breakage.  While "that's what insurance is for" certainly applies, having to try to replace a camera on short notice during a trip is an inconvenience I'd rather avoid.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can check something this delicate/valuable without it being destroyed?  If not, can I at least reduce the chance of major damage somehow?</p>  <p><strong>Clarification:</strong><br> I already have a good camera case.  The problem happened when airport personnel couldn't be bothered to put the camera back properly (I assume the case was searched after I checked it) and instead ripped some of the padded dividers out, crammed them into another part of the case, and wedged the camera in the wrong way.  Without any padding to keep it from moving, and wedged against the side of the case as it was, the camera broke during what may have been normal baggage handling during transportation.</p> 
598	Where can I get information on freighter travel?	<p>I want to go from New York City to any destination in Europe on a freighter.  The only place I've found information for doing this requires a round trip.  I don't want to go round trip.  I want to spend some months in Europe and I don't care where in Europe I start.</p>

441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p>

3087	Dealing with the 'unclean hand' when travelling (if you're left-handed)	<blockquote>   <p>"Among Muslims, the left hand is reserved for bodily hygiene and   considered unclean. Thus, the right hand should be used for eating.   Shaking hands or handing over an item with one's left hand is   considered an insult."</p> </blockquote>  <p>A common enough sentence in many guide books and on Wikipedia.  However, being left-handed it's quite often very unnatural - you reach for food with your dominant hand, pass something with that hand, and ironically the right hand is often the one used for bodily hygiene among left-handers.</p>  <p>Indeed, in Uzbekistan I picked up an apple with my left hand to the horror of the locals I was with on a train ride, at which point one of them who didn't speak English graphically demonstrated that right hand is for eating and left hand is for ... elsewhere.</p>  <p>So, if you're left-handed, how do you deal with it? Tie a string around your hand? Just lots of practice? Or do you just not care, even if their insistence on the right hand can result in them unknowingly getting a hand that is the very one they were trying to avoid?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_the_Middle_East">Source of the quote</a></p> 
5599	OK we're all nerds here, so really, how on earth should I use a Japanese toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone who's traveled to Japan you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>They're devices that are a textbook example of excessive featuritis.</p>  <p>But I want to use something other than the flush knob before leaving Japan. What is a feature that has the following characteristics:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Common to most Japanese toilets.</p></li> <li><p>Hard to get wrong - won't create a mess or damage the toilet.</p></li> <li><p>Simple to comprehend - more likely to involve romaji or kana or simple kanji or pictures.</p></li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UbP9I.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple.

How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
1987	One-way tickets into the US and Canada?	<p>So I have a series of weird flights I can use to get to Bangkok from London with a stop in Vancouver, where it may actually be cheaper for me to fly to Vancouver, bus down to LA/San Fran, and then fly to Bangkok, or fly to LA, bus to Vancouver and then fly to Bangkok.   </p>  <p>Regardless, I've been told there may be problems with a one-way ticket into the US or Canada.  Would it be enough to simply buy a greyhound ticket to show you're leaving the country to your new destination?</p>  <p>Eg:</p>  <p>Fly LON->Vancouver, with greyhound tickets to get me to Los Angeles (or a short flight, yet to decide).</p>  <p>Fly LA to Bangkok.</p>  <p>Presumably in this case I'd simply need to show my onward ticket for each country, be it plane or bus?</p>  <p>(New Zealand passport)</p> 
2007	How can I go from the American side to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls?	<p>My friends told me that Niagara Falls look better from Canada but my bus will stop at the American side. Can I walk over a bridge or take any public transportation to the other side?</p>  <p>Also, as a non-citizen, do I need Canadian visa for crossing border and going around the falls?</p> 
5601	Does the rotation of the earth affect the travel time from Europe to Australia?	<p>Assuming that a place in Europe is exactly on the opposite side of the earth than Sydney. Now I want to take a plane to travel there. Does it matter if the plan flies with the rotation of the earth or counter the rotation of the earth? i.e. Does it matter if the plane flies westbound or eastbound?</p>  <p>Intuitively I would say it does matter, because if I fly against the earth rotation the goal, in this case Sydney is coming nearer. On the other hand, maybe the plane is still in the atmosphere and therefore part of the earth rotation.</p> 
2624	Is it safe to travel to Egypt in early 2012?	<p>Have people been travelling in Egypt after March 2011?  What's the situation like over there?  The election is also happening at the end of November.  Should I wait until after the election to book my tour?  I'm planning to visit early 2012.</p>

4192	How can you get into the San Pedro prison in La Paz? (*and* out again)	<p>The infamous San Pedro prison (El Penal de San Pedro) in La Paz is famous for having no security guards inside, the prisoners run it themselves.  Families of the prisoners often live there too, and it's apparently possible to do 'tours' of the prison, also run by the prisoners.  However it's hard to find information on this as no official tour company can be seen to endorse these, and I'm quite sure nobody would insure them either ;)</p>  <p>Any ideas?</p>

3804	Curonian Spit and Kaliningrad	<p>The <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/994">Curonian Spit</a> is one of the places I would like to visit. As an EU citizen, the obvious approach is to focus on the Lithuanian side. </p>  <p>Nevertheless, I wonder if it is worthwhile to pay a visit to the Russian side of the spit in particular and to Kaliningrad in general. Is it worth incurring the additional hassle, such as e.g. obtaining a Russian visa? If yes, how much time would you allow? Is it something that could be done on a day trip from Lithuania or is it better to spend a couple of days in the Kaliningrad oblast?</p> 
2736	Choices for prepaid GSM data with laptop tethering in Europe?	<p>Planning a trip to Europe later this year that will definitely include Italy, and will most likely include the UK, Germany, and a smattering of connecting and/or distractingly shiny countries. Here in the US, I have both a 4G and 3G mifi and it would be nifty to keep that kind of connectivity while I'm traveling. Both of those gizmos are US-only. My connectivity affects my ability to work while traveling, so it's no exaggeration to say that I'll stay an extra month if I can solve this issue.</p>  <p>I know the trick of landing with an unlocked phone and shoving in a local SIM card, but it's a pain to figure out tethering options for my laptop, which is my #1 priority. (#2 priority: Google Maps.) Are there no-contract providers for this kind of usage?</p>  <p>Question 1a) Alternately, are there EU grace periods for returning a phone and getting a refund? In the US, you get 14 days to return a cell phone.</p>  <p>1b) If the answer to the above is "no", as it would be in the US, are there better options for widespread wifi hookups than Boingo?</p> 
4712	Prepay simcard for data in Australia	<p>I'm arriving in Sydney on Friday for a week.  Ideally I'd like a pre-pay simcard for text and data (I need to check my stackexchange sites of course ;)).</p>  <p>However I have no idea of what companies or options exist, and what would be the best for a traveller in terms of moderate data usage.</p>  <p>Also, is it possible to buy these at the airport on arrival?</p>

610	Is tea and coffee on the street safe to drink in India?	<p>There are many street tea/coffee sellers around India, and although the water has been boiled at some point, often the pots are out for a long time.

4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
6021	Correct reasons for opting out of millimetre wave scanners	<p>Having travelled through SFO a few times, and each time been asked to go through a millimetre wave (or backscatter) scanner, and each time 'opted out' and gone for the search (in public), I'd like to know what is the proper reasons to give when they ask why I've opted out.</p>  <p>I tried the <strong>radiation</strong> argument the first time, just after they were introduced, but this argument doesn't seem to be too valid now since the millimetre wave scanners aren't very powerful.</p>  <p>I've tried <strong>privacy</strong> but not really known what to say afterwards other than the technical issues of caching, wiping images, etc.</p>  <p>Each one got some snarky comments from the security staff, and discussion from the one given the opportunity to feel me up, so I'd like to arm myself with a bit more information/argumentation for next time.</p> 
2250	Trick to breaking down air routes	<p>For example, last year I was looking at Bogota, Colombia to LON.  This was quite pricey, but it turned out if I bought separate tickets - Bogota to Orlando, Florida, and then an Air Berlin flight to London was pretty well priced.</p>  <p>Even better, I checked and it went via Dusseldorf.  However if I just bought the leg to Dusseldorf, caught the 20 min train to Cologne and flew from there, it got cheaper still.</p>  <p>This of course requires hours of messing around with flight websites, and often knowledge (like that Dusseldorf and Cologne are close by).  Surely there's a simpler way?</p>  <p>Eg, I'm looking at flights from Vancouver to Bangkok, and also from LON to either SCL or EZE or Lima or Quito.  One to Quito goes to the Netherlands, somewhere in the Antilles islands, onwards to Guayaquil in Ecuador and then to Quito.  4 flights requires all sorts of playing to find the cheap legs, if any.  Surely there's a 'cheapest paths' search engine that can take care of this somehow, or a simpler way?</p> 
77	Flight deals from the UK	<p>Can someone recommend a good website with flight deals from London/UK, which I could subscribe to? I mean promotions in different airlines, e.g. bmi used to have a bmifriday promotion (not sure if its still ongoing).</p> 
5497	What are some tricks you use to buy cheap airline tickets in Europe?	<p>I have been flying with Wizzair, Ryanair and Easyjet for some time already and have found that there is really a lot to be learned about how to achieve the lowest prices. It was not uncommon for me to buy Ryanair tickets for €20 Euros and come next day to find out that they are for €10. Or to fly home on the 23rd of December for €50 with Wizzair even though the starting price was €100 for all flights around Christmas.</p>  <p>Some of my strategies include buying in the middle of the week and having a diversified set of credit cards to avoid currency-exchange/booking charges (e.g. Mastercard Prepaid for Ryanair). What tricks do you use?</p> 
3560	What is the LEAST visited country by tourists?	<p>There's always lists on the most popular countries.  But in my travels, I've found going against the grain has been super rewarding - places like Chernobyl, in Ukraine, or the desert of Uzbekistan or the mountains of Tajikistan have been some of my travelling highlights.</p>  <p>Then reading a mostly <a href="http://blog.dohop.com/index.php/2011/01/18/the-least-visited-destinations-of-the-world/">fluff piece on the least visited places in the world</a> made me wonder - and I'll need statistics to back this up please, which country has the fewest TOURISTS (that's people from other countries coming to this country for tourism) every year?</p>  <p>Three caveats:</p>  <ul> <li>Antarctica is not a country (for the purpose of this)</li> <li>All the soldiers entering Iraq / Afghanistan do not count as tourists</li> <li>since countries come and go, ideally this would simply be the most recent statistics we can find, which is likely to be '2011' statistics.</li> </ul> 
722	Which credit cards have global coverage?	<p>While traveling I ran into two situations where my credit card was not accepted. I mainly use MasterCard. In China (although 10 years ago) Visa was accepted in most stores, but MasterCard was not. In the US, my MasterCard was rejected multiple times because it was a non-US CC number. This can be a real annoyance. </p>  <p>So could anyone recommend me a CC company which would give me global coverage? Or is this just not possible?</p> 
2198	Travelling to Attu Island	<p>The U.S. Coast Guard recently closed and abandoned (I think) their Loran station on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attu_Island">Attu Island</a>, Alaska. Is it possible to legally visit Attu now? Is there any red tape involved? Is the airport open to the public, or do you need to go by boat?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uCW3c.jpg" alt="Attau Island stock photo"><br> <sup>Attu island o Donnell valley by Sekora, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, found on <a href="http://www.public-domain-image.com/full-image/nature-landscapes-public-domain-images-pictures/island-public-domain-images-pictures/attu-island-o-donnell-valley.jpg-royalty-free-stock-photograph.html"><code>public-domain-image.com</code></a>.</sup></p> 
4031	Is there a powerstrip which accomodates most if not all AC power plugs?	<p>You can buy travel adapters for AC power plugs, but do powerstrips exist that accomodate different international power plugs in one unit? When travelling and collaborating in an international environment, power cords turn into a spagetti of cords. </p>  <p>It would be so convenient if powerstrips exist which accomodate for example an US, a British, French/German power cord on one unit, but I have not find it and I have search extensively. </p>  <p>Do they exist at all, or do international laws prohibit such a device?</p> 
5957	Scotland in one week: What to see and do?	<p>I'm planning to visit Scotland this August with some friends, but we only have one week. We have already made a sketch of our trip and so far we have in mind to visit Glasgow, Stirling, Kyle Of Lochalsh, Isle of Skye, Loch Ness, Inverness, Aberdeen, St Andrews and Edinburgh. We are interested in cities (others or in replace of those I have mentioned above), castles and natural sights that are worth to see. Also we’re going to rent a car, any tips regarding this topic are very welcome as well and we estimate to spend around 700 EUR each (Is this a good budget?). </p> 
6053	What is the best source of information for ATM availability?	<p>From Wikitravel:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Some developing countries either have no ATMs, very limited ATMs, or   are not connected to the international networks. This includes Myanmar   in Southeast Asia, as well as parts of Africa. In Japan, most bank   ATMs don't work with international cards (the cards are even an   incompatible size), so you need to look for a post office, 7/11 or   Citibank ATM. In certain countries, not every ATM accepts foreign   credit or debit cards. So check in-advance about what's available, and   do what's necessary to ensure you have adequate cash during your   travels.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What is the best source of information for finding out about ATM availability? I am travelling around Europe (including Eastern Europe) and trying to figure out what card/card(s) to obtain to make sure that I am never caught without money.</p> 
2939	What can I do to prevent passport stamps being put on blank pages?	<p>I'm running low on blank passport pages which are sometimes needed for full page visas such as those issued by Armenia, India, and Vietnam.</p>  <p>When I crossed the border into Turkey the other day I got my visa-on-arrival and stamp, but instead of putting it on a partly used page, which I have many, the guy at customs and immigration put them on a previously blank page. Now I have one fewer!</p>  <p><strong>What can I do to prevent or at least reduce the chances of this happening?</strong></p>  <p>It's worth remembering that there's likely to be a language barrier and it's always best to be ultra-nice to these border officials.</p>  <p>Has anybody heard of any trick such as sticking bit of paper in your passport, either blank, or looking a bit like visas? I have noticed that nobody ever stamps a page that has a remnant of something once stapled in there in Japan. There is a kind of stub that had its major part torn off along a perforation. Might I be able to emulate this somehow or would that even be worse making the blank pages invalid for full page visas due to having holes from staples? I know some things can get very picky when it comes to customs and immigration.</p> 
4924	Is the Cairo - Cape Town Highway passable?	<p>The Cairo - Cape Town Highway sounds like a very interesting route to discovery Africa by car. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%E2%80%93_Cape_Town_Highway">Wikipedia web site</a> says that some parts are still not finished. So my questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>Is this highway passable from the start to the end with a normal car?</li> <li>Are there dangerous regions that I have to cross?</li> <li>How should I prepare for such a trip compared to a trip in Central Europe?</li> </ul> 
5572	Safest road route from Tangier to Togo	<p>A local NGO that is working with Togo is going to organize a convoy (2 trucks) to bring some educational and medical aid. They will enter to Africa through Tangier, Morocco and are going to drive to Togo. What's the safest route possible? Also if you know some tips to make it safer, it will be very helpful.</p> 
2759	What are the bus (coach) connections from Thessaloniki, Greece to Tbilisi, Georgia?	<p>Well I'm worried the bad weather has set in and I have to switch from hitchhiking to public transport. I know there are buses from Istanbul to Tbilisi but I wonder if there might even be a direct bus connection from somewhere in Greece to Tbilisi since it seems to have a Georgian expat community.</p>  <p>So far I can't find anything with my Internet searches but maybe there are some secrets to be discovered by searching in Greek or Russian?</p>  <p>I've found <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/georgia/tbilisi/transport/getting-there-away" rel="nofollow">mention on Lonely Planet's website that there are indeed buses from Thessaloniki to  Tbilisi</a> - but no details.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>For the truly hardy, several companies run buses to Thessaloniki and Athens (€100) from Ortachala.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1943307" rel="nofollow">Elsewhere on the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree</a> there are some comments with more tidbits but no details:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>djpeanut: A friend of mine took it at the end of last year.

The trip takes about 2 days.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Can anybody find times, prices, companies, departure points, any juicy details I might need?</p> 
6187	Paranoid about missing my return flight home from Rome. What to do?	<p>I haven't been to Europe in 11 years.  My wife and I (and our 8 year old son) will be taking a trip to Italy this late November.  We will be traveling from Venice to Florence to Rome.  We will be flying in Venice and out of Rome.</p>  <p>However, our Rome departure leaves at 9:40AM and the first train to the airport is at 5:52 I believe.  My agent told us to check in at least 3 hours before our flight which puts us at 6:40 AM.  I believe the train takes 32 minutes.</p>  <p>So I'm freaking out a little.  I'm thinking I will stay up all night, take cold showers, etc and yank my wife and son out of bed at 5:00 AM and head to the train station.</p>  <p>What can I do to ease my worrying pain?</p>  <p>Does that plan sound OK?  A later flight will cost over $700 more.</p> 
5755	What is the cheapest way to get from South America to Australia	<p>What is the cheapest way to get from South America to Australia? </p>  <p>I found several flights mostly from Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile, however the prices are quite prohibitive. Do you recommend any alternatives? My journey time is not time limited.</p>  <ul> <li>How to find cheapest flights beside hunting on Quantas/Air New Zealand promotions</li> <li>Any ferry service?</li> <li>Using a freight ship - any opinions? Not very cheap, but comparable to some air tickets.</li> </ul> 
2486	What is the best way to fit the sites I want to see in Rome into two days?	<p>Definition of "best": Cheap, time-efficient, in that order. </p>  <p>I'm going to be in Rome for two full days and I want to hit up the following sites:</p>  <p>Day 1:</p>  <ul> <li>Colosseum</li> <li>Pantheon</li> <li>Spanish Steps</li> <li>Roman Forum </li> <li>Trevi Fountain</li> </ul>  <p>Day 2:</p>  <ul> <li>Vatican</li> <li>St Peter's Basilica</li> <li>Sistine Chapel</li> </ul>  <p>So what I'm looking for advice on is that I want to know the best type of metro/transport pass to purchase (if any), if there are any types of museum pass or whatever that will save money, and what order to see things in on day one (in terms of efficiency). </p>  <p>Thanks.</p> 
6232	How to buy Japanese baseball tickets from the US?	<p>What's a good way to buy Japanese baseball tickets from the US? </p>  <p>I'm trying to get tickets to the 4/13 Tigers game at Koshien stadium in Osaka. I can read Japanese, and would love to buy from the Tigers' <a href="http://hanshintigers.jp/ticket/koshien/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, but their vendors can only mail to Japanese addresses.</p>  <p>So far my only bet is <a href="http://www.japanballtickets.com" rel="nofollow">this guy</a>, who buys tickets and delivers them to your hotel. The downside is that he charges $60 extra per order, and you can't choose your seat section; you can only choose between "good", "better", and "best" seats. </p>  <p>Are there other options?</p>  <p>For example: could I just order from the Tigers' website and have them deliver to my hotel, 3 weeks before I get there? Or do hotels not do that?</p>  <p>Any suggestions would be most appreciated.</p> 
1677	Are there data plans for travelers in the USA?	<p>I intend to travel to the US for a month, and I would really like to use a lot of data traffic during the trip, for browsing, maps, Skype calls, etc. How can I do that? Should I buy a SIM? Do I have to order one in advance, or are data SIMs readily available in the airport? Is there any website that can show me competing options and maybe compare them?</p>  <p>Also, I guess SIMs are linked to one specific carrier. Does it matter which cellular carrier I choose, or do all have similar coverage and do all support GSM phones? Does it change from state to state? e.g. do some of the more states, like Hawaii, have limited coverage for some of the carriers?</p>  <p>In short I am clueless here, and would really appreciate any information about this.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: meanwhile I have found <a href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">this comparison between various data sim suppliers</a>, seems very useful though I'm not sure how reliable or up-to-date this page is.</p> 
5962	Family with kids driving from Marrakesh to Fez - any threat of danger for daytime driving?	<p>We are two parents with three children, a blonde, a red head and one brunette, ages 8,9,and 12 years.  Why do I write that? because we look very American which may not be such a good thing in Morocco.   I love everything I read about the adventure, history and beauty of Morocco and it may be ignorance, but I am afraid of driving cross country and have a fear of being pulled over by machine gun toting rebels kidnapping my children.  Feels awful to say it and this is very ignorant on my part but as a mother I wonder if I am jeopardizing my children??  We have planned driving trips through many European countries and Mexico, when it was safe.  We love to drive and gain our freedom and it is also economical for a family of 5.  All I have read say that Morocco is safe and the people are kind to Americans.  We are well traveled and enjoy simple living and immersion into the culture.  My route would take us from Marrakesh over the mountains to the Kasbahs, Falls, Atlas Film Studio with a drive toward Merzouga and an overnight camel trip to the Sahara and then a drive to Fez. I want to figure out how to put Essouira into the mix as well. I know bad things can happen anywhere in the world I just don't want to fly my family into a place where I shouldn't.  I am becoming more educated that this would be a safe journey.  Please respond.  </p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
435	Should I purchase rental car insurance? What protection does my credit card provide?	<p>We just arrived in Hawaii this afternoon, and when I went to pick up the rental car, I discovered I hadn't done my homework with regard to the insurance options.</p>  <p>I recall that my credit card will provide some level of insurance when I use it to rent a car, but when I mentioned it to the Customer Services Representative, he informed me that my credit card only covers collision, and he suggested I purchase liability insurance from the rental agency.</p>  <p>For the future, what information do I need to collect in order to make an informed decision about what insurance policies I should (or should not) purchase when I rent a car?</p>

3377	Are there ways to keep long-distance land transport costs down in France when not planning in advance?	<p>Ten years ago I travelled around Europe for the first time and in some countries I was very frustrated by high cost of trains and lack of alternatives to them.</p>  <p>I remember being in Cannes with a friend who had tons of money. I had already spent most of my inheritance despite trying to keep costs as low as possible.</p>  <p>We wanted to do something vaguely like Cannes - Avignon - Lyon - Dijon - Paris (I can't remember exactly any more).</p>  <p>But it seemed that each hop in back-then prices on the TGV was about 50 euro whereas we could go straight to Paris for something like 100 euro.</p>  <p>Furthermore, unlike Germany which I was used to travelling around in by then, there seemed to be no cheaper options for slower trains. I always chose the slowest train because I was never in a hurry and enjoyed the scenery. But in France there was no such option.</p>  <p>In other countries I knew how to travel in, like Australia or Canada or Mexico or would take a long distance bus. But as covered by another question, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3375/why-does-there-seem-to-be-no-long-distance-buses-in-france">there don't seem to be any long distance buses in France</a>.</p>  <p>So this lone option of the TGV made it at least double the price and I had already blown some money on trains from Monaco to Nice to Cannes.</p>  <p>We argued and debated and decided it would be worth the gamble to take a train to Marseilles where we expected we would have a lot more options than in Cannes. But when we got there we found it bigger and busier but with the same expensive TGVs and still no other cheaper slower options.</p>  <p>We gave up and just went straight to Paris very grumpy. To this day I have been put off trying to travel around France for the same reason.</p>  <p>So enough whiny anecdotes and on with the actual question: <strong>Were we doing it wrong? Are there ways to visit all these places without blowing the budget on TGV tickets? Is there any other mode of long-distance overland travel within France?</strong> (No flying please, I want to go on roads or tracks through the countryside.)</p>  <p>Oh and just to make it difficult, I like to travel with no plans. So I can't buy passes or book tickets months ahead and I'm too old for student specials.</p> 
956	What is the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA?	<p>Given the extensive time taken for immigration formalities in the US, what is the shortest time to consider between connecting flights in the US, when coming from abroad?</p>  <p>Until now I have always entered the US at my destination. This is not always the cheapest option. I was told that 3 hours is the advised time to go through immigration and boarding of a connecting flight. Online booking sites still offer connecting flights, with a transfer times sometimes even less then 1 hour. </p> 
2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>".

The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p>

6358	What is preferable, Eurail Pass or Buying Pass on the spot?	<p>I plan to visit 3 countries in Europe during May: Paris, Italy and England ( in that order). I will be staying in each country for 1 week; at the end of the week I will be moving on from a country to another. </p>  <p>Edit: Here are more updates on my research. This is my travelling schedule:</p>  <ol> <li>Paris</li> <li>Bordeaux</li> <li>Lyon</li> <li>Milan</li> <li>Florence</li> <li>Rome</li> <li>London </li> </ol>  <p>I plan to use Eurail pass when I travel from Paris to Rome, and I will take a flight from Rome to London.</p>  <p>My question is, is it more worthwhile to by a <a href="http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/select-pass/3-countries" rel="nofollow">Selected Pass with three countries ( because the train from Lyon to Milan stops by Geneva)</a>, or is it more worthwhile to buy the ticket separately?</p> 
239	If I visit Los Angeles, am I better off renting a car or not?	<p>California has a pretty notorious reputation for having bad traffic, so I am wondering if it would be worth my time to rent a car when I visit there. If I stay within the LA area, is public transportation good enough for me to get by without renting a car? I would like to visit Hollywood as well, so will I be able to easily get around by public transportation? Or would I be better off to rent a car if I need to get around?</p> 
217	What part of Great Wall of China is easier to visit, starting from Peking?	<p>I'm interested in visiting the Great Wall of China, but don't want to face many tourists during my trip.<br> Are there such parts of it?<br> Are visitors allowed to walk on it?</p> 
5372	How to visit Wieliczka salt mines and the Auschwitz KZ from Krakow?	<p>I'd like to visit Wieliczka salt mines and the Auschwitz KZ. Is it possible to visit both places the same day? How much time should I stay in each place? What trains/buses have to take from central Krakow? Also, I'm wondering if it will be cheaper and more cost-effective to join to an organized group or do it on my own?</p> 
6498	Exchanging business cards in Japan	<p>In Hong Kong (and I believe other parts of China as well), one offers his business card by holding it with both hands with the text unobscured and oriented so that the other person can read it.  After accepting the other person's card, one is expected to study it for a moment before putting it in one's wallet/pocket.</p>  <p>Are there similar customs surrounding the act of exchanging contact information in Japan?</p> 
1014	How can I avoid or minimize jet lag?	<p>From my personal anecdotal experience, I've found it worse when travelling east around the globe.  I also tend to stay awake most if not all of the flight, so sleeping time doesn't tend to matter as the flights from London to NZ are minimum 28 hours.  Shorter flights you can arrange around daylight hours to reduce this, but otherwise, there must be better strategies to help out with.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>So I was fine despite nearly 48 hours of non-sleep from Mongolia to London, up the next 3 days at 8am to do stuff. However, the <em>second</em> week has been awful, sleepless nights and erratic sleepiness. Any theories?</p>  <p><strong><em>Also see: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2841/how-do-you-prepare-for-long-haul-flights/">How do you prepare for long haul flights?</a></em></strong></p> 
4253	How to get to Christmas Island?	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island">Christmas Island</a> is an island of Australia far off the northwest of the mainland, much closer to Indonesia.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AGMuD.png" alt="Where is Christmas Island?"><br> <sup>(Thanks to Wikimedia Commons for the map)</sup></p>  <p>I know I can fly there but <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Christmas_Island#By_boat">Wikitravel seems to suggest there's no regular ferry or boat transport</a>.</p>  <p>It does mention that I might be able to get there by private yacht or by cruise ship. Does anybody have some actual information about how to find either of these and how much it might cost?</p>  <p>I'd like to know both about getting there (or back) from Australia and from Indonesia. Would one be easier than the other? Would customs and immigrations rules make the latter too tricky? Would it be a good way to get from Australia to Southeast Asia overland?</p> 
2302	Is travelling to Chernobyl safe for tourists?	<p>Recently I read in my Lonely Planet and on some news site like for example <a href="http://health.yahoo.net/news/s/ap/eu_ukraine_chernobyl_tourism">this one</a>, that the site of the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe is open for tourists. There are also tour operators that offer visits to the destroyed city and the nuclear power plant. They state that the only visit "safe" places, i.e. places that are not really contaminated.</p>  <p>I personally have no plan to go there, because I think it is too dangerous and I also don't like disaster tourism.  But nevertheless I will be in Kiev soon, and a friend accompanying me plans to go there. So I have some questions:</p>  <p>Is it really possible to differentiate places in the Chernobyl area that are less contaminated than others? Are these tours safe? Is it ethically correct to visit such places?</p> 
6531	How can I visit Chernobyl?	<p>I have heard that it's possible to visit Chernobyl as a tourist (and some questions here on Travel bear this out, asking <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2302/is-travelling-to-chernobyl-safe-for-tourists">if it's safe to do so</a>.)</p>  <p>I'd like to visit it.  What do I need to know to do so well, that is, to get there and to have a good trip?  I'd like to avoid overly-touristy tours, if they exist.  I also really enjoy urban exploration, and I'd love to be able to explore the city, although I think Chernobyl would be somewhere I would have to be careful!  So:</p>  <ul> <li>How can I visit it?  How is best to get there from (say) Kiev?</li> <li>Are there tour companies or guides?  Are these high-quality, interesting, at-your-own-pace or maybe even one-on-one tours, or 'touristy' tours?</li> <li>Can you stay nearby overnight, in order to not be hurried?</li> <li>(Related to the linked question) Are there maps of safe areas and irradiated areas?  How do you know where to go and where not to go?</li> <li>What specific things should I keep an eye out for?  For example, is it true you can see the nuclear plant glow at night?</li> </ul> 
4305	How can I get a flight with a supersonic plane?	<p>My dream is to fly with a supersonic plane. Since the Concorde is no longer active, I don't think it is possible to do this with a regular plane. So how can I get onto board of a supersonic plane? Ideally it should be in Central Europe.</p> 
6564	Are there any boat tours for Lake Baikal?	<p>I am interested in visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_baikal">Lake Baikal</a> and exploring the areas around the lake.  What is the best way of doing so and which nearby town should I use as my homebase?  I'd expect using a boat to go from the west to the east side is much easier than traveling by land.</p>

3356	How big is "too big" for an airline seat? At what point will you be required to buy two tickets?	<p>As I said in another question, I'm bringing my parents to visit me here in Sweden next year.</p>  <p>My mother is around 280-300 pounds and 5'6" (130-135kg, 1.67m). I am concerned that she might be asked at the airport to buy a second seat. If it's likely I would rather just buy the second seat in advance, because I don't want her to be embarassed/humiliated by some random employee. As well, I won't be there, they will be travelling alone and aren't used to dealing with airports and they won't know what their rights are.</p>  <p>In terms of how it will affect other passengers, it's not important, she will get a window seat and my dad will sit in the middle seat, so I don't see it affecting anybody. </p>  <p>She insists it's fine, "the last time I flew I fit easily!" but that was 20 years ago when she was half the size. </p>  <p>They will be flying BA or SAS, definitely not Ryanair.</p>  <p>So - where is the cutoff? Is a 300 pound 5'6" woman going to be too big to fit in a single airline seat? Or am I worrying about nothing?</p> 
25	What are the best ways to avoid data roaming fees when travelling abroad?	<p>I'm looking for data plans I can use while touring different countries within a region without having to worry about being eaten by roaming fees. If such plans exist at all, I suppose mostly big telecommunication providers like Vodafone or T-Mobile will offer them.</p>

6649	Long Stay Visit to France Without Visa	<p>I'm planning on living in France for 7 months teaching English, and I'm hoping that my boyfriend will be able to accompany me.</p>  <p>After learning that the Long-Stay Tourist Visas are very difficult to obtain, we've been considering his going over and staying past the legal 90 days. I figure he won't really have that difficult of a time while in France, but do we risk his deportation if we try to travel outside of France after that 90 day period? I've read that when you cross country borders within the Schengen region, immigration officers don't check your passport--true or false?</p>  <p>Also, what happens when we're trying to leave France at the end of the 7 months, will he be at risk of getting fined or detained when we're trying to leave the country? </p> 
1899	Volunteering opportunities when travelling overseas	<p>I know this is a fairly broad question, but I am looking for a resource that lists volunteering opportunities with local charities when travelling overseas or an organisation that does something similar. Sites for local charities probably will list how to get involved; what I am specifically looking for are places that accept short-term (couple of weeks or months) involvement. Not a problem if the opportunities are unpaid (because most tourist visas don't allow employment).</p>  <p>EDIT: Mark's pointed out a pet-peeve: searching online often yields companies that expect payment in return for arranging volunteerships. Not interested in those.</p> 
1013	Website resources for 'out there' jobs related to travel	<p>I've come across a few travel + working websites - which can get you a 'non-standard' job in a remote place - <a href="http://escapethecity.org/" rel="nofollow">like EscapeTheCity</a> which has had roles from post office master in Antarctica to landmine defuser to chocolate taster.  </p>  <p>I'm looking for 'something' - preferably in Latin America - ideally travel related, and I'm struggling to find work+travel websites that aren't just 'volunteer-tourism' where you end up paying to do it.  I currently work as a software contractor, but given my explosion of interest in travel the last few years, and having done some fairly hard travel, have some experience of that.</p>  <p>Hiking/trekking guide - no, don't have the physical ability to lead something like that.</p>  <p>But working with animals, sure, leading tours, sure, teaching English in the jungle, sure that also could be interesting.  But something related to tours - organising, leading, researching or travelling-ahead-to-prepare-for-the-group would be my ideal short-term goal for a role.</p>  <p>These are however kinda non-standard and not that often advertised for.  Any travel working resources would be of interest.  This could probably be a community wiki too.</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p>

489	Are there currently any international ferries that travel to Saint Petersburg, Russia?	<p>Years ago I was in Europe and decided it would be a great idea to go to Saint Petersburg by ferry since it is regarded as a beautiful city and is a port. I didn't mind departing from Finland, Estonia, or pretty much anywhere else. I only wanted to arrive by sea as this was the whole point.</p>  <p>I could not find at the time details on the Internet, Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, or travel agencies about where to depart from or if any international ferries even existed. Finally I found out there were none.  </p>  <p>This was in 2001. Has the situation changed in the past ten years?</p> 
5312	How to successfully haggle / bargain in markets	<p>While I've done quite a bit of travel now and back myself to handle situations when it comes to border guards, sorting accommodation and / or transportation, one thing I still struggle to come to terms with is haggling in the markets, be it for food, clothing or other.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FImXq.jpg" alt="Image of haggling in a market"></p>  <p>Image © Peter Morgan, 2014 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356</a></p>  <p>What is the best way to go about this?

6642	Method/time to see the Grand Canyon and Meteor Crater, in Winslow Arizona	<p>So I want to visit both the Grand Canyon, and Meteor Crater in Arizona.</p>  <p>Having little to no idea about getting around in Arizona, I'm assuming there are three acceptable options:</p>  <p>Drive - I picked the Skywalk as a random point and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Grand%20Canyon%20Skywalk%20Entrance,%20AZ%2086434,%20United%20States&amp;daddr=Winslow,%20AZ,%20United%20States&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=35.024187,-110.697357&amp;sspn=0.104869,0.220757&amp;geocode=FR2AJQIdZ2E3-SG-JOMol4wxzA;FTttFgIdc-Rm-Sm3Q6RgC0IuhzHoJhf1r1HIwQ&amp;oq=grand%20canyon&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=7" rel="nofollow">asked Google for directions</a> to Winslow - it suggests 5.5 hours - is this fair?</p>  <p>Train - Amtrak goes through Winslow - but does it go anywhere near the Grand Canyon that is convenient and useful?</p>  <p>Bus - again, I'm not sure that this is useful - time schedules and so on.</p>  <p>So assuming driving is the more sensible option, and that I'd want to spend at least a full day at the Grand Canyon, and some time at the crater during daylight, are three days in the area sensible? Or would I come away feeling like I'd robbed myself?  I'd like to see some more of the canyon than just the skywalk, but while I can hike for hours on the flat, slopes tend to do me in even when fit.</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
6594	Is there any travel management software / webportal available?	<p>All my sportive trips such as biking or hiking, I enter in an online portal called <a href="http://www.hikr.org">www.hikr.org</a>. This portal allows to enter tour description, mark waypoints, and share the tour with others. Additionally, there are some nice statistics available, as for example the mountains you have visited or the mountain huts you stayed in.</p>  <p>Additionally, I use mytourbook.org to manage my GPS tracks of my tours. This software allows me to watch all my tours on a map and also to calculate some nice statistics about the length, the altitude etc of each tour, week, month, year or category.</p>  <p>Is there anything similar for travel trips? For example an online portal where I can enter all my trips, share it with others to get some inspiration for further trips and maybe also mark cities I've visited during my travel.</p> 
6471	How to generate a travel map?	<p>For various reasons I have to present ~100 pictures of my last trip through Europe. To make this presentation more informative, I'd like to include an animated travel map that shows the route I traveled. It should be possible to enter various destinations and then link them in arbitrary order. Additionally, I'd like to specify if I used a plane, train, ferry, bus or car.</p>  <p>Are there any free tools available that have these features?</p> 
1978	Where is the museum of socialist art in Sofia, Bulgaria?	<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44255439/ns/travel-destination_travel/t/bulgaria-opening-museum-socialist-art/">this article</a> on a new socialist art museum in Sofia. It looks really interesting and since I'm in Sofia I'd like to visit.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/e0bU8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>But the article only lists "in a Sofia suburb", Google Maps doesn't find it, and my other searching isn't working for me yet. Maybe it would be easier to find by searching in Bulgarian or even Russian? Can anybody find its address for me?</p> 
2798	What publicly accessible tall structures to take photos from exist in London?	<p>I'm looking for publicly accessible tall structures in London from where I can take photos of the city.</p>  <p>The Monument to the Great Fire of London has pretty good views, and I understand you can get good views from the dome in St Paul's Cathedral. Any other locations?</p> 
6869	What publicly accessible tall buildings are good for views & photography in Manhattan?	<p>There was a <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2798/what-publicly-accessible-tall-structures-to-take-photos-from-exist-in-london">similar question for London</a>... but <strong>what about New York City</strong>? </p>  <p>I'm mainly thinking (Midtown) Manhattan, but feel free to recommend awesome vantage points elsewhere in NYC too. If going to the place is <strong>free or cheap</strong>, that's obviously a big plus.</p>  <p>Including (or linking to) opening hours in the answer would be great.</p>

6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
6751	Getting a SIM card (prepay) in India	<p>Unlike in the UK and most of the European countries (where one can buy a SIM over the counter in any of the shops), getting a SIM in India is a tedious process. One has to provide a copy of ID proof (both photo ID and an address proof) and then wait couple of hours, sometime one day to get the SIM activated. This doesn't seem to be a concern for an Indian resident as we can wait.</p>  <p>I am looking for information from tourists/visitors outside India who were on a short visit (tourist/business) and managed to get a cell connection. I would like to keep this information handy so that I can share it with my friends when they visit India. </p> 
6435	Sim Card with data plan in China?	<p>I'm traveling to Beijing for a short trip (4 days), and don't want to be without my phone or pay ATT roaming. I have an unlocked, international compatible phone.</p>  <p>What kind of options are available in Beijing? I like data. Especially in 3G.</p>  <p>Should I just buy something from CM at the Beijing airport? Or do I need to plan ahead of time?</p> 
4712	Prepay simcard for data in Australia	<p>I'm arriving in Sydney on Friday for a week.  Ideally I'd like a pre-pay simcard for text and data (I need to check my stackexchange sites of course ;)).</p>  <p>However I have no idea of what companies or options exist, and what would be the best for a traveller in terms of moderate data usage.</p>  <p>Also, is it possible to buy these at the airport on arrival?</p> 
6866	Wifi coverage in SE Asia?	<p>So how common is wifi/internet access in SE Asia. And more specifically for: Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaysia?</p> 
1677	Are there data plans for travelers in the USA?	<p>I intend to travel to the US for a month, and I would really like to use a lot of data traffic during the trip, for browsing, maps, Skype calls, etc. How can I do that? Should I buy a SIM? Do I have to order one in advance, or are data SIMs readily available in the airport? Is there any website that can show me competing options and maybe compare them?</p>  <p>Also, I guess SIMs are linked to one specific carrier. Does it matter which cellular carrier I choose, or do all have similar coverage and do all support GSM phones? Does it change from state to state? e.g. do some of the more states, like Hawaii, have limited coverage for some of the carriers?</p>  <p>In short I am clueless here, and would really appreciate any information about this.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: meanwhile I have found <a href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">this comparison between various data sim suppliers</a>, seems very useful though I'm not sure how reliable or up-to-date this page is.</p> 
25	What are the best ways to avoid data roaming fees when travelling abroad?	<p>I'm looking for data plans I can use while touring different countries within a region without having to worry about being eaten by roaming fees. If such plans exist at all, I suppose mostly big telecommunication providers like Vodafone or T-Mobile will offer them.</p> 
4602	3 days in Amsterdam: What to see?	<p>In a few days I'm flying to Amsterdam. We will spend there a fun weekend as I repeatedly mentioned in previous questions. But nevertheless a little bit of sightseeing is also necessary. I don't know a lot about Amsterdam, so I'm looking forward for typical sightseeing suggestions. So far, I have only one point on my list, the "Anne Frank Huis".</p> 
69	How bad is baggage theft at Johannesburg airport?	<p>South Africa's Johannesburg's airport has a reputation for stolen and rifled baggage and a quick Google search returns many travelers reporting similar stories. My question, is how bad is the situation now. I noticed that many of these reports are older--from around 2006--and that the airport authority started a campaign to resolve the problem. Has the situation improved in 2011?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
7056	What are the two closest capital cities in the world?	<p>Recently, there was a discussion here on Travel.SE about what are the two closest capital cities in the world. One user argued that it is Vienna and Bratislava. Another one stated either Vatican City and Rome or Kinshasa and Brazzaville. A quick Google Search turned out that there are references for all three claims.</p>  <p>Since I'm always very interested in traveling to special locations, I wonder if there is any authoritative reference that tells me to which capital I have to travel to check this from my traveling-todo-list.</p> 
733	What's the easiest way to find a vacation rental?	<p>I've rented a few vacation homes and really liked it but it always takes hours and hours to find a good one.  It seems like there are 100+ different sites that all list different homes (some with a lot and some with fewer nicer ones) and I keep thinking I'll find the perfect spot on the next site.  Is there a Kayak or Expedia for vacation rentals (I did try Vamoose, but that was terrible)?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

1598	What does a technical stop mean in air travel?	<p>When I look at my flight itinerary, it says that the flight includes a technical stop.  What does that mean compared to a layover?</p> 
7144	In the context of air travel, are layovers different to stopovers?	<p>In a recent question somebody <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7140/how-does-customs-work-if-my-layover-is-in-a-third-country">asked about a <em>layover</em></a> without mentioning how long the stop would be, thus implying it might perhaps be understood whether <em>layover</em> generally refers to a stop not requiring an overnight stay.</p>  <p>In Australia where I'm from we don't really use <em>layover</em> but we're familiar with it from American TV and movies, in which travellers never appear to take breaks between flights to stay a few days.</p>  <p>In Australia we do use <em>stopover</em> (it can also be spelled <em>stop over</em> and <em>stop-over</em>) and very often we do take a break on our flights, because they can be very long, to stay one night or many nights in a destination other than our ultimate destination.</p>  <p>So is it that <em>layover</em> means a short break where you just hang around in the aiport and <em>stopover</em> means a long break where you'll spend some nights in a second place en route to your destination?</p>  <p>Or is it that both words mean a stop, either short or long, and the only difference is which is the more popular in each country?</p>  <p><strong>As evidence that they're not the same:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>We currently have two separate tags: <a href="/questions/tagged/stop-overs" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'stop-overs'" rel="tag">stop-overs</a> and <a href="/questions/tagged/layovers" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'layovers'" rel="tag">layovers</a></li> <li>The post <a href="http://maphappy.org/2012/03/the-difference-between-a-layover-and-a-stopover/" rel="nofollow"><strong>"The Difference Between a Layover and a Stopover"</strong></a> on <code>maphappy.org</code> states "Technically, though, a stay in an intermittent city under 24 hours is a layover.

7140	How does customs work if my layover is in a third country?	<p>I want to fly from the US to Israel and am looking at a flight with a layover in Canada (PIT -> YYZ -> TLV).  How does customs work on such a multi-country trip?  Do I have to go through the process for both Canada and Israel (and then Canada and the US on the way back), or do I do it just once so long as I stay within the secure zone in the middle airport?  If it's just once, is it at the destination or in Canada?</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p> 
6591	Russian visas and short-term apartment rental in St Petersburg and Moscow	<p>I'm attending a close friend's wedding in Russia in July. We'll be visiting St Petersburg for a few days first, then on to Moscow. We have a toddler who goes to bed early and we would much rather stay in AirBnB type apartments rather than hotels. There seem to be many such apartments, and I read elsewhere that this sort of thing is quite popular amongst foreigners. </p>  <p>It's unlikely I'll be able to get a homestay visa from my friend's family because there are many such visitors. I know that for a tourist visa I need confirmation from the hotel or travel agent, but these apartments aren't really either of those, as far as I know. Perhaps the AirBnB hosts hold get me a homestay visa? Perhaps I could go to a travel agency, explain my itinery and ask for them to sponsor a tourist visa? Are ever of these options? Are there any other possibilities?</p> 
5932	What time do buses and/or marshrutkas leave from Tbilisi for Batumi?	<p>I'm trying to find out for a hostel guest what time buses and/or marshrutkas depart Tbilisi to get to Batumi.</p>  <p>I can find on the Internet that the travel time is between four and six hours and that the price should be 18 GEL (Georgian lari).</p>  <p>But I can't seem to find anywhere that has a timetable.</p>  <p>Are there both buses and marshrutkas or only one or the other?</p>  <p>Do marshrutkas leaves whenever they are full or do they adhere to a timetable? Even if they leave when full I assume there is a set time for the first and last trip.</p>  <p>Ideally I'd like to know for both Ortachala and Didube bus stations since I believe there are departures from both.</p> 
4413	Is it really permitted for travellers to work while visiting Georgia on a tourist visa?	<p>Last night at a party with lots of expats and Georgians the topic came up that foreigners don't need any special visa or work permit to work in Georgia while they are visiting the country as tourists.</p>  <p>But can this really be true? Both Georgians and foreigners there said it was but I want to find an authoritative source because the consequences for working illegally can include deportation or being banned from future visits. I wouldn't want to tell people to come and work here on their travels if the advice could get them in trouble.</p> 
4152	Can I travel to North Korea overland (via train)?	<p>I understand there's only one company that actually does the North Korea tours (although a lot of other tour agencies will allow you to book through them). I am wondering if they have an option to enter via train instead of by plane, especially considering that the North Korean national airline has a very low safety rating.</p> 
7031	Getting to San Andrés	<p>Last year in Valencia, Spain I happened to talk to a Colombian woman who generously praised San Andrés as a destination. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago_of_San_Andr%C3%A9s,_Providencia_and_Santa_Catalina">San Andrés y Providencia</a> is an archipelago (and a <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_Colombia">departamento</a></em>) in the Caribbean Sea belonging to Colombia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andr%C3%A9s_%28island%29">San Andrés</a>, the main island, is located about 200 km off the Nicaraguan coast and maybe 300 km from Costa Rica (with Colombian mainland much farther away).</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DYLO7.png" alt="San Andrés"><br> <sup>Location of San Andrés island. Image from <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">Bing Maps</a>.</sup></p>  <p>Not long after that, while in Costa Rica (and briefly Panama), I was interested in whether I could catch a boat to San Andrés, or if I'd need to fly (via Bogotá or something). I eventually discarded the plan as I only found flights which were very expensive and I was running out of time. </p>  <p>Now, in retrospect, I'd love to know the answer: <strong>What are your best options to getting to San Andrés, especially if you happen to be in Costa Rica?</strong> Are there <strong>boats or ferries</strong> of any kind from Nicaragua or Costa Rica (or Panama or Colombia)? Or are flights the only real option—and if so, are there direct flights from elsewhere than mainland Colombia?</p>  <p>(Also, if you've been there, feel free to share your impressions. Is it indeed something special, or just a nice beach resort for well-to-do Colombians?)</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AAWDb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br> <sup>San Andrés, February 2006.

2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p>

4939	Is it better to book a car rental in advance, or once I'm in South Africa?	<p>I'll be traveling to South Africa this spring, and we're in the midst of planning our itinerary. Because we have items on our to-do/to-see list that span a large geographic area, friends have recommended that we rent a car for part or all of our trip.</p>  <p>My question is: as an American, are there any advantages to waiting until I am actually in South Africa to rent a car? I imagine we'll be picking up and dropping off cars at an airport (we're flying in and out of Johannesburg, but may fly down do Cape Town and work our way back north by car). Is it possible to negotiate prices, or simply get better deals, by waiting until we arrive? Or should we book rental cars well in advance? Would we be in danger of not having cars available if we didn't make an advanced reservation?</p>  <p>Our trip is 10 days long, so it's a short term rental rather than long-term/mini-lease.</p> 
2865	Itineraries in South Africa (+/- 2 Weeks)	<p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2862/trip-to-south-africa-in-december-january">I plan to travel to South-Africa at the end of this year (last week of December, first week of January).</a> Now I would like to have some advice on some possible itineraries. The trip will take about two weeks. I plan to travel independently. I would like to focus on one region if possible. What we would like to do is to enjoy some scenery that we don't have in Europe, and to see some wild animals. </p>  <p>I have a couple of itineraries in mind:</p>  <ul> <li>Panoramic route and the Kruger National Park</li> <li>Saint Lucia, Hluhluwe and maybe Swaziland</li> <li>Cape Town and the Karoo</li> <li>Namaqualand and a dip into southern Namibia</li> </ul>  <p>We have already been to Kruger Park, but returning there is not a problem at all. What do you think is the best option? Could you advise on alternative routes and itineraries? </p> 
5871	Can I visit vineyards in Stellenbosch without booking a tour in advance?	<p>I'm going to South Africa this month and will be in Cape Town for several days. Since one of South Africa's major wine regions is just outside of Cape Town, I'd like to spend a little bit of time there. </p>  <p>I've seen several companies that will provide tours along the Stellenbosch wine route. Many of these require committing a full day or multiple days to a tour; are there any vineyards in the Cape Winelands that I can visit <em>without</em> an advance booking of a tour? </p>  <p>I don't have a firm itinerary planned out (will partly depend on how jet-lagged I am!), but I'm looking for something between a half day and a full day. It doesn't matter much whether I have an official tour with a guide versus wandering around on my own and talking to vineyard staff; I'm happy to pay for tours and tastings, as long as I don't have to decide in advance. I'm mostly looking for the flexibility to wake up one morning and just go.</p> 
2862	How difficult is it to find accommodation in South Africa in December / January?	<p>I plan to travel to South-Africa at the end of the year (last week of December, first Week of January). I plan to spend more or less two weeks there. My understanding is that this period is really high season. Hence I wonder how difficult it will be to find an accommodation at that period? Are there places that are advised or disadvised?</p> 
5312	How to successfully haggle / bargain in markets	<p>While I've done quite a bit of travel now and back myself to handle situations when it comes to border guards, sorting accommodation and / or transportation, one thing I still struggle to come to terms with is haggling in the markets, be it for food, clothing or other.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FImXq.jpg" alt="Image of haggling in a market"></p>  <p>Image © Peter Morgan, 2014 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356</a></p>  <p>What is the best way to go about this? I'm generally either worried I'll offend them, or that they're trying to rip me off anyway, so it's a weird combination of awkwardness inside my head ;)</p> 
2458	Hostels in US vs. Europe	<p>How do hostels in the US compare with hostels in Europe? Are they similar in terms of convenience, availability, cost, amenities, etc? Or is the "hostel culture" completely different in the two places?</p> 
5174	Where to exchange money in Wroclaw	<p>I'm arriving to Wroclaw airport (Ryanair) next April, where should I exchange most of my money? In the airport, in the city or in another city?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
4978	Can I side-step discrimination against foreigners in Japan?	<p>I've heard that there can be discrimination against foreigners, and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debito_Arudou">naturalized citizens</a> born in other countries, in Japan, and that it happens in onsen, bars, and adult entertainment establishments.</p>  <p>Is this a more common problem in more rural areas, such as Tohoku, than in metropolitan places such as Tokyo?</p>  <p>Are most places that discriminate against foreigners strict about their policies, or are they willing to ignore the rules if you're obviously not a trouble-maker? What if you explain that you aren't one of (Nationality X) that's caused trouble lately?</p>  <p>In places where a significant proportion of establishments discriminate against foreigners, are the places that don't discriminate fairly inferior to those that do discriminate?</p> 
3418	Which countries are "Muslim countries"?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3410/will-i-get-in-trouble-if-i-drink-beer-in-public-in-dubai">the question about drinking beer in Dubai</a> it arose that the term "Muslim country" can be seen as one where the laws of the country are affected by the rules of the religion (like Dubai), whereas other countries may be secular countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations (like Turkey).</p>  <p>So which of the countries that have high Muslim populations are not secular and have laws based on the religion?</p>  <p>(I know this is asking for a list but it's a small, definite, closed set so not "too broad" in the sense possible with many questions.)</p> 
2683	What kind of clothes and footwear are ideal to visit Egypt?	<p>I'm planning to visit a few places in Egypt during the month of January or February.  The locations on my itinerary are:</p>  <ul> <li>Cairo</li> <li>Alexandria</li> <li>Aswan</li> <li>Abu Simbel</li> <li>Luxor</li> </ul>  <p>I plan to spend anywhere from 1 to 2 days at those locations.  Is it culturally acceptable for a male to wear shorts, tshirts and flip flops?  What's the temperature like at this time of the year?  Will I need a sweater?  Are hiking boots required or just the general walking shoes?  My tour will not include hiking for more than 1 hour.</p> 
3960	Is there any way to spend a night in a European castle?	<p>I spent a night in a jail converted to a hotel in Switzerland, and it made me wonder if there is a real castle converted to an hotel in Europe.</p>  <p>And with "real" I mean the castle should have a historical past, and NOT a castle built recently or a hotel with a 'castle' look on the outside but on the inside it looks like a common hotel.</p>  <p>In short, I want to feel that I was brought back to the castle age if I stay in the hotel.</p> 
6806	Looking for a very last minute adventure trip (5th -13th May)	<p>Basically, due to a break up and cancellation of previous arrangements, I find myself with a free week next week and I really fancy doing something active and outdoors. Most of my trips recently have been scenery, cities and museums, so I'd like to try something more adventurous. I've tried some of the adventure travel places online, but most have been fully booked, or it's too late for the dates I need, so I'd like a recommendation for a place that I can head to and just arrange to do various things there on my own. I'm looking for things like white water rafting, kayaking/canoeing, mountain biking, trekking... maybe para-sailing, bungee jumping... I'm generally open to any ideas that don't involve museums and galleries :P</p>  <p>I'm in the UK, and only have a week (9 days at most, Saturday to Sunday) so somewhere that doesn't take too long to get to would be ideal. If there was one place I could head to to do multiple activities, that would be great, and I'm open to splitting the time between a couple of locations. Budget wise, cheaper would be great, but last minute will always cost more so not really a requirement, and happy to pay more for something that's truly awesome. Any advice would be much appreciated :)</p> 
3125	Travel guides that covers the International E-road network?	<p>During the last days I read a lot about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_E-road_network">International E-road network in Europe</a>. Since I'm a big road trip fan, I really would like to follow more or less one road in the near future. Does anybody know if there exists a travel guide book (like for example Lonely Planet) that covers one of such roads? I would be interested in information about the details concerning the road trip (what visas are necessary, what permits do I need to take my own car into the country, etc.) as well as the sightseeing in the area of the road.</p>  <p>I'm particularly interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E58">E58</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E60">E60</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E75">E75</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E40">E40</a>.</p>  <p>For example  I have a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1864502142">Lonely Planet book</a> at home that covers a trip from Istanbul to Kathmandu. I'm wondering if there is something similar like that that follows a E route.</p>  <p>I found another interesting book called <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1742205895">Great Journeys</a>, but I´m still looking for a E-road network book.</p> 
4936	Is there any highway, road or something else that covers the Grand Tour?	<p>Recently I read about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour" rel="nofollow">Grand Tour</a>. It seems to be a journey or route that was very popular in late renaissance (17. and 18. century). Since it leads trough countries I wanted to visit again, and covers region I think are interesting, I was wondering if there is any European highway or a signed route or something similar, that covers more or less the typical Grand Tour journey.</p> 
7563	Are there European equivalents of "Route 66"	<p>Is there an equivalent to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Route_66">Route 66</a> available in Europe? Here I am not talking about the actual road with the number 66, but about a "trajectory" with a mythical connotation to its name. I did not follow route 66, but I guess due to its fame doing route 66 offer quite some touristic opportunities, compared to doing highway "john doe". I am aware of the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3125/travel-guides-that-covers-the-international-e-road-network">international e-road network</a>, but I am not so much interested in following one specific highway, more to do an interesting well documented road trip in Europe. </p> 
7579	Travelling Roman Roads	<p>There is a question on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7563/are-there-european-equivalents-of-route-66">mythical roads in Europe</a>. I think that there are a couple of mythical and historical roads in Europe: the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_roads" rel="nofollow">Roman roads</a>. It should be possible to follow their tracks approximately and to visit historical sites alongside. </p>  <p>Hence my question. Does anyone know about resources for the modern and motorized traveler who would like to explore these roads? They should ideally translate the old courses into existing roads. They should also describe relics and interesting sites that can be visited today. </p>  <p>Alternatively, if such resources do not exist, does anybody know about good and reliable historical books on the topic? I believe that with a reliable documentation, a modern road map and perhaps one or another guidebook, I should be able to knit something on my own. </p>  <p>Please note that I am mainly interested in the road network in Europe. Nevertheless, if you happen to have material on the Roman roads in Africa or the Near East, I will not dismiss it.  </p> 
6955	What are the "rules" for multi-city flights?	<p>As I understand things, airlines generally give discounts for round-trips that consist of a flight from A to B followed by a flight from B to A.  How does this logic work for multi-city flights?  As an example (but don't focus strictly on this example), what about a flight from A to B followed by a flight from C back to A?  What logic is applied to determine whether to charge as separate one-way trips or as a discounted multi-city trip?  Is the important part that the trip begin and end in the same space, or does there need to be an unbroken cycle?</p>  <p>I know I can prod travel search engines for specific examples, but if I understand the rules it can help in my search.  Is this airline dependent?  Does it matter whether the flights are domestic or international (I'm only concerned here about domestic)?</p> 
7585	What exactly is a open-jaw flight?	<p>Recently, I was looking for a flight from A to B and then a flight back from C to A. Using my English dictionary, I found that this is called an open-jaw flight. However, several native English speaker stated, that they never heard the term. Others mentioned that it is only an open-jaw flight if BC is shorter than AB and/or CA.</p>  <p>Therefore I would like to see a canonical definition of an open-jaw flight. I'm also interested in a term that describes the flight legs described above. In German it is called Gabelflug, but what is the English term?</p> 
7601	What's the difference between a direct and a non-stop flight?	<p>In a comment to one of my question, a user mentioned that there is a difference between a direct and a non-stop flight. So what is this difference?</p>

7256	If I want to see the Olympic Torch in 2012, what route is it taking in the UK?	<p>The claim is that 95 per cent of the UK population will come within ten miles of the torch during its 8,000-mile journey between May 19 and July 27.</p>  <p>Is there a map of the route of the general UK travels of the torch?</p> 
6316	Is there a dress code when visiting the Vatican in Rome?	<p>I've heard from friends who have been to Rome that you must cover up when you visit the Vatican as they have a strict dress code. </p>  <p>What does "cover up" mean? I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem in Winter but we are off in July. What kind of clothes would be suitable for women and men in summer?</p> 
1224	Tactics to avoid getting harassed by corrupt police?	<p>In Uzbekistan I was stopped, searched and questioned six times in one day.</p>  <p>At the border with Tajikistan, one official tried hiding my paperwork to elicit something from me.</p>  <p>In Kyrgyzstan, I was physically harassed and detained by the police, and about US$30 taken while they searched everything on me and a Dutch backpacker I was going to get food with.</p>  <p>I'm not particularly dodgy looking - it's happening to a lot of backpackers I meet.  Tourists are apparently a prime target for corrupt officials.</p>  <p>Any suggestions or tactics for avoiding these occurrences?  Aside from carrying only photocopies of your passport so that they can't hold your passport ransom, I've not heard many successful tips...</p> 
886	Paris Gare du Nord to Gare Montparnasse, by public transport but without lots of walking?	<p>In a couple of weeks time, I'm off to the Loire by Eurostar + TGV, which means a cross Paris change. The Eurostar uses Gare du Nord, while the TGVs down to the Loire are at Gare Montparnasse.</p>  <p>One option is to take a taxi, but that looks to be around the <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm#taxi">€30 mark</a>. </p>  <p>There is a direct metro line linking the two stations, M4, which would seem to be a great bet. Unfortunately, the metro station isn't really at Gare Montparnasse, but is instead <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm#Metro%20routes%20from">a 750m+ walk</a> with lots of stairs. With a load of luggage, that's not looking much fun...</p>  <p>If I want to do the transfer by public transport, is that my only bet? Or is there another route (perhaps by bus?) that'll let me get from one station to the other by public transport, but without lots of walking?</p> 
7273	Is it possible to travel to Cuba by sea (from e.g. Mexico)?	<p>When I was reading about Cuba around the time I visited there (2008), I got the impression that <strong>the only way in is by air</strong>.</p>  <p>Now, as of 2012, is this (still) the case? Or <strong>are there any cruises, ferries, or other sea travel options for reaching Cuba</strong>, legally, from some of the nearby counties? (Either for a day-trip or a longer visit.)</p>  <p>I mean, Mexico is close. So are Jamaica, Bahamas, and many other island nations. (And Florida, of course, but I suppose we can count that out for now.) You can easily fly to Havana from e.g. Kingston, Nassau, or Cancún—it'd only make sense if you could take a boat too.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OkUnp.png" alt="enter image description here"><br> <sup>Image from <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">Bing Maps</a></sup></p>  <p>(For the purposes of this question, assume that the Cuban tourist card/visa is already sorted out.)</p> 
7405	How to get from Delhi to Kathmandu overland?	<p>I am going to Nepal and probably, same as everyone, through Delhi. I was considering going overland from Delhi to Kathmandu, however I have found many posts that advise against it in favor of a flight. The following concerns are the key to the proper decision, I think.</p>  <p>Does the overland route offer a good scenery and cultural experience or is it  better to spend that time in Nepal?</p>  <p>What is the rough cost of an overland journey and how does it compare with a flight?</p>  <p>In case of a flight, is the Indian visa necessary?</p> 
7653	What is the safest way to travel from Hunza (North Pakistan) to Kashgar (West China)?	<p>What is the safest way to go from <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hunza_Valley" rel="nofollow">Hunza</a> (North Pakistan) to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Kashgar" rel="nofollow">Kashgar</a> (West China) ? Travelling mainly by bus and local transportation wherever possible.</p> 
1777	What options are there for a 5-hour layover in Kuala Lumpur?	<p>On a trip between London and Sydney/Brisbane, we have a 4-5 hour stopover (between scheduled departure and arrival) at KL in each direction. We're travelling economy class on Malaysia Airlines.</p>  <p>I would guess that we won't have time to leave the airport; I'd be interested in any information about the sort of facilities we might find to kill a few hours (as well as knowing how long the baggage/immigration etc might take). I wouldn't mind spending a modest amount on lounges, for example, but which ones are good there (and would be convenient for our circumstances)? We are infrequent travellers, so anything subscription based is probably not suitable.</p> 
1887	Do US pre-paid GSM sim cards normally work in Canada?	<p>For an upcoming trip, I'm going to spend about 10-15 days in the USA, followed by about another 10 days up in Canada. While over there, I expect I'll want to make and receive a few phone calls, send some texts, and probably use a few tens of mb of data too. Looking at the roaming prices for my UK mobile in the US and Canada, this isn't something I'm going to want to use my normal phone for...</p>  <p>In the past when I've only been in one of the USA or Canada on a trip, I've picked up a Pre-Pay GSM sim card, and it's all been fine. For this trip, I'd ideally just get the 1 sim card to cover the three weeks. However, I'm aware that it's quite rare for pre-pay sim cards to work outside of their own country. (European ones tend to be the exception I've found, no other ones I've got ever have done)</p>  <p>So, I'm wondering, do pre-pay sim cards bought in the states normally work over in Canada, and if so, are the prices when roaming there normally sensible or insanely high?</p> 
7735	What's a "trip kitty"?	<p>On some organized tour operator's sites, I see tour prices listed with a +amount labelled as "<em>kitty</em>" or "<em>trip kitty</em>" like this one. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zl1Yj.jpg" alt="Trip Kitty in addition to tour price?"></p>  <p>What is a "trip kitty"?</p>

Whole round-trip starts from the Baltics - Germany - Netherlands - Belgum - Luxemburg - towards Baltics. I'm not in a hurry and I would like to spend some time sightseeing. </p>  <p>I'm not looking for "just beautiful" buildings, famous statues, amusement parks or similar places where one could spend their all day and all their money.  </p>  <p>Some examples from another countries I liked: Hill of crosses in Lithuania, Wieliczka(in Poland) salt mine, windmills in Netherlands, some great Castles   - things that make you go "wow" one way or another</p>  <p>What are a must-see places in Belgium? </p> 
5334	Need malaria meds for Rajasthan in February?	<p>Rajasthan appears to be <em>relatively</em> low risk for malaria in February, so should I take malaria meds while I'm there (for two weeks) or just try to avoid getting bitten? Obviously I'll use Deet and take all the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites, and I have a supply of Malarone if needed, but I can't seem to find any reliable information as to the risks so that I can make an informed decision as to whether to take the Malarone or not. If it makes any difference I'm taking my 14 year old son with me and I need to decide for him too.</p> 
5282	Can I buy malaria medication in India?	<p>In question '<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/497/1317">Is it necessary to take malaria pills when travelling in South India?</a>' we discussed whether it is necessary to take any medication. So if one has decided to take the pills, is it possible to buy them in India rather than buying them at home? If so, are all different types available and how much are they?</p>  <p>For my last trip in South East Asia I bought a good bunch of mefloquine pills in London for a lot of money. Because I stayed longer than planned and run out of them eventually, I had to buy more locally and there were much cheaper in SEA. (Yes, I do think they were the real thing!)</p> 
6070	I've been told one state in the US is the easternmost, westernmost and northernmost state. How to visit the points?	<p>According to what I've been told, one state (Alaska) has land which is considered the easternmost, northernmost, and westernnmost in all of the USA.  What are the three points that allows it to claim this, if it is indeed true, and how to get there?</p> 
26	What should I know about "Around The World" flights?	<p>I have heard rumours of such things, and have had a difficult time find information on "around the world" flights.  Are they worth it (do you have a limit between usage, do you save money.. etc.) and are there easy ways of getting more informed on them (specific sites, travel agencies)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> With the goal of maximum continental coverage, no specific start or finish locations</p>

Mainly because it is the northernmost inhabited place still on the north American continent.</p>  <p>However, I understand there are no regular roads going to the place. Although the normal way of getting there is by either airplane (in winter) or ship (in summer), I've read some info that says it should be possible to get there by four-wheel drive, but none go into any detail.</p>  <p>So, the big question is: Can one drive to Barrow with a 4x4?  </p>

2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p>

862	What is the minimum passport expiry period when travelling to USA on an ESTA authorization from a previous visit?	<p>I've heard that when travelling to the USA your passport must not expire within 6 months of travelling. Is this the case if you have a valid ESTA visa waiver program authorization from a previous visit? I visited the USA last year under the visa waiver program but now that I've run out of Reese's Pieces I'm coming back for more! I'm travelling in September but my passport expires in November. My ESTA autorisation from last year is valid until the date of my passport expiry.</p>  <p>I can't say that I've noticed anything on the ESTA website about passports not expiring within 6 months but after a 12 hour flight I don't want to leave anything to chance.</p> 
8022	Hiking in the area around Quebec City	<p>I've decided to go spend 2 weeks in Quebec with my wife this summer.</p>  <p>Our plan for now is to</p>  <ul> <li>spend a few days in Montreal (where our plane lands, coming from France)</li> <li>spend a few days in Quebec City</li> <li>rent a car and spend a week exploring Quebec's surrounding, maybe towards the north and Tadoussac, probably hiking a little in the mountains</li> <li>go back to Montreal (and take the plane)</li> </ul>  <p>I'd like to know where I can find hiking maps and topos for the region between Quebec City and Tadoussac. Is it possible to walk about everywhere in the mountains or are there many restricted areas ?</p>  <p>Any advice regarding small hiking trips in this region welcome !</p> 
8023	How to travel from Montreal to Quebec City without a car?	<p>This is related to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8022/hiking-around-quebec-city">Hiking around Quebec City</a></p>  <p>As I'll spend a few days in Montreal, then a few days in Quebec, I'd like to avoid renting a car just to go from one town to the other one. What's the most convenient (travelling with my wife and big backpacks)?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> : viarail's web site doesn't seem to be able to manage online payments with visa card (no information given by the site on failure). Is somebody aware of a workaround to pay for train from another country ?</p> 
5040	Can I apply for and receive a US visa when residing in country other than my own?	<p>I'm currently residing in a country other than my own, and am planning a business trip to the USA for a week. Being a Bulgarian citizen, I do not qualify for the ESTA visa waiver program, unlike other EU countries.</p>  <p>The US embassy in Sofia lists a <a href="http://bulgaria.usembassy.gov/to_apply.html">7-step procedure</a> which they inexplicably describe as "really quite easy". Unfortunately, some of the steps involved would be a major inconvenience for me, as I'm not residing in the country currently, particularly the interview and the visa/passport delivery.</p>  <p>I was hoping it could be possible to apply for a visa from the country of current residence rather than my own, but I wasn't able to find any information on the US embassy's webpages concerning this.</p> 
983	Can I get warfarin in Tajikistan (or nearby?)	<p>I've run into a major problem, requiring urgent Warfarin.  However, am in Khorog, Tajikistan, and there's NONE in town, and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country, save for the 5 tablets in my bag.</p>  <p>My question is, <strong>what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for (NZ passport), which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin</strong>.</p>  <p>I have an entry visa for Russia if need be - if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...</p> 
798	In the US, what's a good prepaid GSM SIM card without a phone?	<p>My daughter is going to spend the next school year (August 2011 to June 2012) in Memphis, TN as an exchange student from Switzerland. She'd very much like to use her iPhone during her stay in the United States.</p>  <p>What are her options for getting prepaid talk, text and data services without also having to buy a new phone? I realize that she'll be limited to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile because of the GSM network.</p>  <p>As far as I've read, T-Mobile SIM cards only work on T-Mobile branded phones, so is AT&amp;T her only option there?</p> 
2495	Cheap pre-pay sim in Canada?	<p>I have my UK-based Android smartphone, but yay for Orange (sarcasm), it's locked and will take 3 weeks to unlock!  Fortunately I also have a low-tech Nokia - I just need a sim.  Rogers quoted me <em>$70 CAD</em> to get up and running with a pre-pay sim.  Given it costs about 10 pounds in the UK to do the same, this seems pricey.  Any suggestions for pre-pay sims (I don't need data, just text and phone).  In Vancouver.</p> 
1887	Do US pre-paid GSM sim cards normally work in Canada?	<p>For an upcoming trip, I'm going to spend about 10-15 days in the USA, followed by about another 10 days up in Canada. While over there, I expect I'll want to make and receive a few phone calls, send some texts, and probably use a few tens of mb of data too. Looking at the roaming prices for my UK mobile in the US and Canada, this isn't something I'm going to want to use my normal phone for...</p>  <p>In the past when I've only been in one of the USA or Canada on a trip, I've picked up a Pre-Pay GSM sim card, and it's all been fine. For this trip, I'd ideally just get the 1 sim card to cover the three weeks. However, I'm aware that it's quite rare for pre-pay sim cards to work outside of their own country. (European ones tend to be the exception I've found, no other ones I've got ever have done)</p>  <p>So, I'm wondering, do pre-pay sim cards bought in the states normally work over in Canada, and if so, are the prices when roaming there normally sensible or insanely high?</p> 
8125	How rigorous are Amtrak in enforcing luggage rules?	<p>Looking at Amtrak trains between NY and Boston, I found that all had "no checked luggage" save for a midnight train (less than ideal for a relaxing vacation).</p>  <p>Looking at <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/Satellite?SnippetName=IBLegacy&amp;pagename=am/AM_Snippet_C/SnippetWrapper&amp;ibsref=NoCheckedBaggage">this reference</a>, it's not really that restrictive as you can take bags on to the train.  My question is on the size restrictions of 28" x 22" x 14" (70cm x 55cm x 35cm in my parlance).  We'll be travelling with a backpack taller than this, albeit not much (maybe four to eight inches/10 to 20 cms), so I was wondering how much effort Amtrak puts into enforcing this?  Has anyone else travelled with an oversized baggage as "carry on"?</p> 
2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
1911	Should I change most of my money in my home country or in the destination country?	<p>Where can I get more favourable exchange rate, in general?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
1772	How can I translate medicines?	<p>I know that if I have stomach issues I can take an <em>Enterogermina</em> or an <em>Imodium</em> if things get severe. I know that if I have throat ache, I can take a <em>Benagol</em>. I know that if I have a strong headache a <em>Tachipirina</em> can reduce the pain.</p>  <p>However, those names are all Italian. Now, I did bring a few of those with me, but I might have to buy more now that I'm in the Netherlands, and drugs aren't like other products where I can look at the packaging/branding and recognize the Italian equivalent thereof.</p>  <p>How can I translate drug names?</p> 
8071	Where should I look for cheap renting cars in USA?	<p>I would like to rent a car in the USA from beginning of September for approximately 1 week. I would like to rent it in Niagara and give it back in New York. Where should i look for cheap opportunities? I know the major rental car companies, but maybe there is a local advice for something cheaper.</p> 
7708	Travelling to Brazil without return ticket	<p>Last year I was flying to Brazil with <a href="http://condor.com/">Condor</a>. I don't need a visa, if I stay in Brazil below 90 days (regardless if tourism or business). </p>  <p>The check-in clerk asked me about visa or return ticket. I didn't have return ticket, because at that time I didn't plan my whole trip and have not decided where to go next. I was told, that without a visa or a valid ticket out of Brazil I will not be allowed to check in. <br/> (There was enough time, so I just went and bought cheapest ticket to Montevideo, but that's not important here.)</p>  <p>My question is: <strong>did the person have right to deny checking me in?</strong> Is this anywhere in regulations or law?</p> 
2767	Germany, Switzerland, Czech Republic - Suggestions for 3 week vacation	<p>My wife and I are looking to take a vacation next year, in September, to the above noted countries. I would like to solicit the 'must see' places in those countries. I focus more on the history (ie. castles, monuments, museums, sights, buildings) while my wife focuses on the exciting edgy stuff (ie. restaurants, sights, shows, exotics). </p>  <p>Here are some places we are definitely going to:</p>  <ul> <li>Neuschwanstein Castle</li> <li>Baden &amp; the Black Forest</li> <li>Bern, Switzerland</li> <li>Salzburg (I know it's not Germany, but it's on the way to Prague from Bavaria)</li> <li>Karlovy Vary</li> <li>Hitler's eagle's nest</li> <li>Rothenburg</li> <li>Wurzburg</li> <li>Berlin</li> </ul>  <p>I'd like to get several dozen items on my list before planning our vacation. I would also like to know if taking the train would hamper our vacation? I'm not opposed to renting a car.</p> 
3274	Which Cities In Finland (if any) Have a Medieval Architecture?	<p>When I visited Helsinki, it was arguably the most avant-garde capital in Europe. That's because it had been founded in the late Middle Ages, and apparently had been partially rebuilt even later (after a fire).</p>  <p>Are there any current major Finnish cities (or even former ones, like Vyborg) where the architecture is medieval, or at least "pre modern" (before the lat 1600s)?</p> 
7118	Changing planes at Frankfurt	<p>I am planning a trip to Rome, Italy from Bangalore, India. </p>  <p>Looking at the flight tickets, it will be 30% cheaper for me to book the Bangalore-Frankfurt and Frankfurt-Rome legs separately rather than as one ticket. They are all on Lufthansa though.</p>  <p>If I booked the tickets separately, when changing planes at Frankfurt, would I have to claim my checked in baggage and recheck in? Would it be possible to check the baggage through to Rome at my origin airport, Bangalore?</p> 
529	Is it possible to go directly from Siem Reap to Vientiane over land?	<p>I'm planning on going to Vietiane in Laos, but I wanted to cross over land from Cambodia. Are there direct bus connections from Siem Reap to Vientiane, and if so, how long does the journey take? I have heard conflicting reports - some say yes, some say there's no way around it but to double back to Phnom Penh and catch a bus from there to Vientiane, which doesn't make sense at all to me. Or, if not a direct bus from Siem Reap, then is it possible to get to Stung Treng checkpoint by local bus, then connect to Vientiane from there? (If not bus, boats / ferries are acceptable too.)</p>  <p>I have also heard that even though the official Lao immigration site says visa-on-arrival is available at land border checkpoints, they have stopped issuing them at Stung Treng and require visitors to get a visa beforehand. Is that true?</p> 
823	Which chateaux of the Loire are worth visiting?	<p>When visiting France, one of the great things to see are the Chateaux of the Loire Valley. An hour by TGV from Paris, yet a world apart, with stunning grand palatial castles in beautiful scenery, it's certainly somewhere to visit.</p>  <p>If you check most guidebooks, they all seem to agree on two Chateaux to visit. Firstly there's the Château de Chambord, an impressive Renaissance masterpiece that's the largest of the Loire Chateau.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QNc9P.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:France_Loir-et-Cher_Chambord_Chateau_03.jpg"></p>  <p>The other that everyone seems to agree on is the Château de Chenonceau. While smaller, the rooms, tapestries, furniture and artworks are stunning, and you visit as much for the contents as the building itself. There are some very nice gardens too.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nky8B.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chateau_de_Chenonceau_2008E.jpg"></p>  <p>Having visited these two last year (along with a couple of others), I'm keen to see a few more this year. The problem is that most guidebooks either seem to stop after just a few, or go on to list several hundred, without the middle ground.</p>  <p>My question therefore is what other Chateaux of the mid Loire (roughly Angers to Tours)  should one try to see (beyond the obvious two of Chenonceau and Chambord), and why?</p> 
3070	Are there scheduled flight connections operated with a helicopter?	<p>I know that you can charter a helicopter, it is expensive but possible. But can I go on a scheduled flight with a helicopter? If so, which connections?</p> 
6896	NYC–Montreal and NYC–Toronto overland	<p>I was thinking of going <strong>from NYC to Montreal</strong>, and the first thing that sprang to mind is taking a train. </p>  <p>The distance is about 530 km (330 mi) beelining or 595 km by road—not much more than Madrid to Barcelona. There must be viable non-flight options, right?</p>  <p>What are the best options by rail or coach? What would you recommend, taking duration, price and convenience into account?</p>  <p>How about <strong>NYC-Toronto</strong>, which by road is around 780 km (490 mi): are there good train/coach connections to that direction? Looking at the map, I guess the options might be more limited...</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XcOIb.png" alt="enter image description here"><br> <sup>Image from <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">Bing Maps</a></sup></p> 
3521	5 hours in Amsterdam	<p>I have a 5-hour layover at AMS on a Saturday evening (16:00-21:00), on an intra-EU itinerary to the UK.  I'd like to leave the airport and have dinner in town. </p>  <ul> <li>Is this reasonable?  (From reading the travel wiki article, it looks like this is plenty of time to take the train into the city and back.)</li> <li>Ideally I would like to find a restaurant that is popular, not expensive, and <strong>quintessentially Dutch</strong> (i.e. traditional).  I am looking for restaurant recommendations in particular, or recommendations on where to find decent recommendations. (The travel wiki article's 'eating' listings are pretty sparse.)</li> </ul> 
1497	Are there any repercussions from having an Israeli stamp in my passport?	<p>I have heard people say that having a stamp from Israel in your passport can cause problems when trying to get into other countries.</p>  <p>Is there any truth to this statement? If so, which countries does it create issues with?</p> 
2571	Is it possible to tour the facility where Kahlúa is made?	<p>Now I know you can visit plenty of wineries, breweries, and distilleries around the world. But my favourite alcoholic beverage is Kahlúa, a coffee liqueur from Mexico exported around the world.</p>  <p>Does anybody know if it's possible for any random person, or also only under some special circumstances if that's the case, to tour the place where they make Kahlúa?</p>  <p>The company site doesn't mention anything, in fact I can't even find where in Mexico it's distilled/manufactures/bottled other than on the label it just says its a product of Mexico.</p> 
1153	Which Australian bank/account incurs lowest fees using an ATM card overseas?	<p>As per <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1011/us-debit-atm-card-with-lowest-fees-for-travel">this question about US banks</a>, I would like to know if any Australian bank offers an account with an ATM card (or Visa/Mastercard debit card) with no or low fees for travellers using them in foreign cash machines.</p>  <p>This includes whether certain Australian banks have deals with certain other banks in other countries where fees are waived/reduced.</p>  <p>My current bank account seems to have too many and too high fees when I'm travelling. If there's a better one I may change banks when I get home.</p> 
767	How to stay in Thailand for more than 30 days?	<p>Thailand imposes a 30-day limit on stays for U.S. citizens travelling on a tourist visa. What is the preferred way to stay up to three months? So far, I've come up with these options:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Fly to Singapore or another nearby destination; upon return, obtain another 30-day visa (for overland travel, I would only get another 14-day visa).</p></li> <li><p>Obtain a longer term visa (quite pricey and lots of paperwork)</p></li> </ol> 
7935	Which trains in France are included in an InterRail card?	<p>I have two questions related to an InterRail in France, I'm planning to have in August.</p>  <p>I'm planning to get an InterRail pass for France only, or for France and Benelux as well.</p>  <p>Not sure if there are differences between these InterRail cards, inherently to the type of trains I can book/reserve.</p>  <p>What are the trains that I cant take or that require additional reservation costs?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <ul> <li>are TGV covered except for the reservations or they are not covered at all?</li> <li>how do I know if a train is not covered? for example RATP is a not supported trains company</li> <li>are all trains available on the official french trains website www.voyages-sncf.com covered by the InterRail pass?</li> <li>Ive been told to use the German railways website www.bahn.de because it is more efficient. Any tip is welcome.</li> </ul> 
7854	How to safely find an holiday apartment for renting in NYC?	<p>We get horror stories about apartment renting in the US in the papers here in Australia periodically.  However we're potentially looking to stay in NYC over New Year's with a few friends, so apartment renting also seems the most practical accommodation.</p>  <p>Is there a particularly reputable site that does verification of its holiday rentals?  Conversely are there some that should be avoided?  I notice TripAdvisor has some holiday rentals listed - where do they fall?</p> 
5309	What to do with your valuables on a low-cost holiday while swimming/diving in Central America?	<p>I am planning to go to central America (Costa Rica + Panama) for a rather budget holiday, and I am wondering what people usually do with their documents, money, cameras, etc. when staying in a budget hotel (without a safe in the room) and wish to go swimming/diving? The two obvious options would be to leave all your stuff in your hotel, and even worse - leave them on the beach. But I guess if my stuff gets stolen in both of these cases, I am not going to get anything from the insurance company.</p> 
7982	What kind of passport do I need when entering the USA?	<p>I heard that you need a biometric passport if you want to enter USA. However, my friend has a biometric passport, but no fingerprints in it. Is this enough? And how long has the passport to be valid? Is it okay if it expires on the day after his return date?</p> 
8720	Turkey transit visa for a stateless person?	<p>I am a stateless person but I am a resident of Uzbekistan. I am going to visit Bulgaria on the 16th of August this year. Unfortunately there is no direct flight to Bulgaria so I have to fly through Istanbul. In this connection do I need a Turkey transit visa if I only stay in Turkish International Airports for not more than 3 hours waiting for my next connecting flight? If so, how long will consider my deal? And how can I speed up the process of getting transit visa? Can I get the visa in the airport? How much will it cost?</p> 
4864	What should I look for in a vehicle insurance policy for taking my US vehicle into Mexico?	<p>I have been told that driving my private vehicle from California into Mexico is no big deal EXCEPT that I must have Mexican insurance. I am looking for specific recommendations about what to look for when buying the insurance - are all policies basically the same, is there an official agency that needs to underwrite the policies, are there exemptions to be wary of, etc etc. If you know of approximate cost of the policies, please post that as well.</p> 
435	Should I purchase rental car insurance? What protection does my credit card provide?	<p>We just arrived in Hawaii this afternoon, and when I went to pick up the rental car, I discovered I hadn't done my homework with regard to the insurance options.</p>  <p>I recall that my credit card will provide some level of insurance when I use it to rent a car, but when I mentioned it to the Customer Services Representative, he informed me that my credit card only covers collision, and he suggested I purchase liability insurance from the rental agency.</p>  <p>For the future, what information do I need to collect in order to make an informed decision about what insurance policies I should (or should not) purchase when I rent a car?</p> 
946	When to book tickets from travel sites rather than airline sites?	<p>When booking plane tickets, I generally buy directly from the airline's website (as it is often the lowest or near-lowest price for the destinations I travel between). However, I know there are many other travel sites like Expedia, Travelocity, or Kayak.</p>  <p>When does it make sense to buy from one of those sites instead of direct, and what are the pros and cons of tickets purchased through them?</p> 
1943	Can I use USD in Canada?	<p>I will go to Canada for the first time from the United States. I will use credit card as much as possible but I guess I need cash for small shops and cafes anyway. To avoid exchange money back and forth and ATM fees, I plan to cash some money in USD and carry it with me. As of today, 1 CAD = 1.0086 USD so it should be easy to convert currency. Do small retail stores in Toronto accept USD in cash? If so, how are their exchange rates?</p> 
1949	Turning off GPS on a flight?	<p>Inspired by a question if it is allowed to use a Kindle during a flight, I'm wondering if it is okay to use a GPS watch like <a href="http://www.gpsrunningwatchreview.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>  <p>I use this for practice purpose, but it is also my normal watch. I don't see any special setting to turn of the GPS, so do I have to leave the watch at home? Or do I have to remove the battery?</p>  <p>The same problem with my digital camera which has a built in GPS receiver to geotag a picture. Is it a problem if this GPS receiver is working during a flight?</p> 
2796	Long term travel without being wealthy - how is it possible?	<p>Some people are practically most of the time traveling, from country to country, for a very long periods and sometimes even years. </p>  <p>How could one be able to travel for a long period of time, over several countries around the world, without being wealthy?</p> 
678	What time do the city buses start running in Istanbul?	<p>I want to get an early start tomorrow morning taking bus 83O from Taksim Square to the Bayrampaşa Otogar bus station to the west.</p>  <p>I can't find by searching in English what time the Istanbul public buses commence operation in the morning. If they start at various times it's this particular bus I'm interested in.</p> 
5106	What do you do when you're on-the-road and you cannot shower?	<p>Let's say you're backpacking and you're staying at a super-cheap hostel. Either because you have a lot planned for the day or you're catching long distance bus / train, you've to get up really early in the morning. The showers either don't have hot water or it doesn't work. It's cold and you <em>really</em> don't want to stand under a stream of freezing cold water.</p>  <p>Not really a hypothetical scenario because I've been there, done that, got the t-shirt. So what's your travel tip for when you're travelling and find no place to shower?</p> 
7234	Dealing with smelly travel daypacks?	<p>This came from an idea I saw on another website's thread that wasn't getting much love.  When travelling, especially in hot, humid regions, you tend to sweat - especially in the back area where your daypack presses against your body.</p>  <p>My latest daypack goes some ways to prevent this by having another layer with a gap between the pack and the body, but it only goes so far.</p>  <p>As a result of all this, there can be 'an interesting aroma' emanating from your daypack.  Worse if your stored food also suffers from the heat.  Any solutions for dealing with this while on the go? </p> 
8901	How to get from Istanbul Ataturk Airport to Yenikapi Ferry Terminal by public transport?	<p>My flight lands in Istanbul Ataturk Airport at 2am on a Saturday. There's <a href="http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/go/Istanbul/Transport/yenikapi.html">a ferry from Yenikapi to Bandirma at 7am</a>, which I wanted to catch so that I can then catch an onward train to Izmir the same day.</p>  <p>Is it possible for me to get to Yenikapi Ferry Terminal on time to catch the ferry using public transport at that time of the day? Or if not, is it possible at all to get from the airport to Yenikapi later (there's a ferry later in the day too)? There seems to be <a href="http://www.havatas.com.tr/en/coach.aspx?i=6">a Havatas bus from Yenikapi to Ataturk</a> but there isn't any indication as to whether this bus service runs the other way round too.</p> 
6132	Visa for France - showing actual hotel booking?	<p>I am in UK planning to apply for Schengen visa via French Embassy. The application document requirements for the visa states that you are required to submit:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Proof of Hotel reservation confirmation required from the actual   hotels throughout the whole itinerary showing the hotel's full contact   details, proof of payment and applicant's name</p> </blockquote>  <p>However I am planning to get the hotel booking done from <a href="http://booking.com">booking.com</a> as it is convenient and has better offers. Will that be acceptable for visa submission? Is it ok to submit the confirmation from booking.com as long as it states my name and complete hotel details (name, location..)?</p> 
8815	Flying while pregnant?	<p>Do all airlines have a standard policy on pregnant women flying with them?  I know of <a href="http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/conditions-carriage-full/global/en">Qantas's policies</a>, but would I have to check every other airline to verify they're all the same?</p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p> 
3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
5599	OK we're all nerds here, so really, how on earth should I use a Japanese toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone who's traveled to Japan you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>They're devices that are a textbook example of excessive featuritis.</p>  <p>But I want to use something other than the flush knob before leaving Japan. What is a feature that has the following characteristics:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Common to most Japanese toilets.</p></li> <li><p>Hard to get wrong - won't create a mess or damage the toilet.</p></li> <li><p>Simple to comprehend - more likely to involve romaji or kana or simple kanji or pictures.</p></li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UbP9I.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
7779	Price-hacking a one-way flight?	<p>I will be travelling to the USA in a month (by plane) but have found one-way flights are more expensive than return. Is there a good way to deal with this? So I can book the cheapest flight possible, when and where might I look to book?</p>

4031	Is there a powerstrip which accomodates most if not all AC power plugs?	<p>You can buy travel adapters for AC power plugs, but do powerstrips exist that accomodate different international power plugs in one unit? When travelling and collaborating in an international environment, power cords turn into a spagetti of cords. </p>  <p>It would be so convenient if powerstrips exist which accomodate for example an US, a British, French/German power cord on one unit, but I have not find it and I have search extensively. </p>  <p>Do they exist at all, or do international laws prohibit such a device?</p> 
4459	Are there still any “Fly as much as you like” air passes for the U.S.?	<p>Back in 1993 I had a ticket called 'Delta Air Lines Travel America Standby Airpass' that allowed me to take an unlimited number of flights on Delta Airlines within a 30 day period. 60 days were available as well.</p>  <p>There were some conditions:</p>  <ul> <li>You had to purchase the pass along with a transatlantic flight (possibly other long distance flights into the U.S. worked as well and they did not necessarily had to be with the same airline)</li> <li>You could not be a resident of the U.S. or Canada</li> <li>You could only use flights within the continental U.S.</li> <li>Your seat was not guaranteed, when showing up at the airport you would get added to the bottom of the stand-by passengers list, but most of the time, this was not a problem.</li> </ul>  <p>I know that at the time other airlines besides Delta had the same kind of passes, but do they still exist today?</p>  <p>It seems today air passes work differently, you have to buy coupons for a predefined route. The price depends on the distance and number of flights. An example is the <a href="http://www.staralliance.com/en/fares/regional-fares/north-america-airpass/">Star Alliance North America Airpass</a></p>  <p>That's not what I am looking for, I like the unlimited 'Fly as much as you can' pass.</p>  <p>If there is a positive answer to this, it may also be a good answer to the question <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/31/1317">'Sightseeing the USA by air'</a></p> 
2907	Can you use a kindle as a boarding pass?	<p>I heard that a reason for the low energy consumption of a kindle is that it uses some sort of "electronic" ink. Electricity is then only used to change the ink patterns. This made me wonder if you could use a kindle as boarding pass. I have tried boarding with an iPod touch by storing the pdf on it, but it was not accepted. I had to fetch a paper print of my boarding pass.  </p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
9004	Male nerd here, how on earth can I listen to an "otohime" / "sound princess"?	<p>The other day, I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan#The_Sound_Princess" rel="nofollow">"otohime", also known as "sound princess"</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Many Japanese women are embarrassed at the thought of being heard by   others during urination (see paruresis). To cover the sound of   bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously   while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process.   As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was   introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound   of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand   name commonly found is the Otohime (音姫, lit. "Sound Princess," also   homophone with a legendary goddess Otohime)</p> </blockquote>  <p>As a male, is it possible to hear one in real life?</p>  <p>Do they exist in mixed gender / unisex toilets? If so, where are mixed gender toilets most common? (I haven't noticed any in my previous two trips)</p>  <p>Otherwise, should I try finding an otohime in an Akihabara shop, or possibly some sort of museum?</p>

7144	In the context of air travel, are layovers different to stopovers?	<p>In a recent question somebody <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7140/how-does-customs-work-if-my-layover-is-in-a-third-country">asked about a <em>layover</em></a> without mentioning how long the stop would be, thus implying it might perhaps be understood whether <em>layover</em> generally refers to a stop not requiring an overnight stay.</p>  <p>In Australia where I'm from we don't really use <em>layover</em> but we're familiar with it from American TV and movies, in which travellers never appear to take breaks between flights to stay a few days.</p>  <p>In Australia we do use <em>stopover</em> (it can also be spelled <em>stop over</em> and <em>stop-over</em>) and very often we do take a break on our flights, because they can be very long, to stay one night or many nights in a destination other than our ultimate destination.</p>  <p>So is it that <em>layover</em> means a short break where you just hang around in the aiport and <em>stopover</em> means a long break where you'll spend some nights in a second place en route to your destination?</p>  <p>Or is it that both words mean a stop, either short or long, and the only difference is which is the more popular in each country?</p>  <p><strong>As evidence that they're not the same:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>We currently have two separate tags: <a href="/questions/tagged/stop-overs" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'stop-overs'" rel="tag">stop-overs</a> and <a href="/questions/tagged/layovers" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'layovers'" rel="tag">layovers</a></li> <li>The post <a href="http://maphappy.org/2012/03/the-difference-between-a-layover-and-a-stopover/" rel="nofollow"><strong>"The Difference Between a Layover and a Stopover"</strong></a> on <code>maphappy.org</code> states "Technically, though, a stay in an intermittent city under 24 hours is a layover.

7695	Layover at Tokyo Narita airport: can I travel outside, and what kind of visa would I need?	<p>I am traveling from Singapore to San Francisco and an airline which I am choosing has a layover of 7.5 hours at Tokyo Airport (NRT). I am wondering if I would be allowed to go out to experience the city for a while in some form a visitor visa.  I know, Singapore has such facilities, but does anyone know if I can do something similar in Tokyo? Any suggestions or pointers are welcome. Note - I do not have a visa for Japan yet, but I am hoping that 1 day visitor visa could be possible at airport.</p> 
9042	Are there any places that serve Korean food in Doi Mai or Mangalia in Romania?	<p>Those who've never been here before might not expect it, but there's something of a Korean presence on the Black Sea Coast within 10km of the Bulgarian border.</p>  <p>The main entity is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daewoo_Mangalia_Heavy_Industries">Daewoo Mangalia Heavy Industries</a>. Basically one of Korea's biggest corporations is has a huge shipyard here with Korean equipment, where new ships are built, and I guess ships come for upgrades and repairs too. I took a photo of a Korean ship there this morning which I'll add soon.</p>  <p>Sometimes last summer when I was staying at the next beach south, Vama Veche, I saw a couple of out-of-place middle-aged Asian guys. Now I know they must've been connected in some way to the Daweoo shipyard up the coast.</p>  <p>Now where there's expats there's generally expat food. What I want to know is if there is a restaurant, eatery, canteen, etc in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Mai">Doi Mai</a> or <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Mangalia">Mangalia</a> just to cater to these far-from-home Korean businessmen and sailors. Because I bet I miss the amazing Korean cuisine almost as much as those guys and I want some too!</p>  <p><strong>Can I get Korean food around Mangalia, Romania?</strong></p> 
4152	Can I travel to North Korea overland (via train)?	<p>I understand there's only one company that actually does the North Korea tours (although a lot of other tour agencies will allow you to book through them). I am wondering if they have an option to enter via train instead of by plane, especially considering that the North Korean national airline has a very low safety rating.</p> 
5161	Are there any trains where roof riding is legally possible?	<p>I just read an <a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/train-roof-riders-deterred-by-balls-kai/493169">article</a> about the Indonesian railways, where they put low hanging  concrete balls above railroad tracks to deter train rooftop riders. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3KCdc.jpg" alt="Roof riders in Burma, photo by Peter Hahndorf"></p>  <p>Roof riding is common on certain trains in Indonesia, but it is illegal. </p>  <p>In Burma people also did it, but they wouldn't let us go up on the roof. What about India?</p>  <p>It was also popular on the tourist trains in Ecuador, but after two people cut their heads off a while ago, they are now very strict about this. </p>  <p>So are there any trains where you are actually allowed to ride on the roof? And how dangerous is it assuming there are no concrete balls in the way?</p> 
7525	Transport for Tour of Southern Spain	<p>I've been to the south of Spain a few times and was hoping to make another trip in the near future. My plan is fly from JFK or ORD to Madrid to Sevilla (obviously assuming this is the cheapest route available). </p>  <p>I then want to stay in Sevilla for 4-5 days. Then head south to Ronda, Marbella, Malaga, and Grenada. </p>  <p>What is the cheapest (yet still reasonably comfortable) method to travel between these Spanish cities? </p> 
5436	I need to fly today, where can I search for options?	<p>A friend of mine needs to fly today. All typical aggregated booking sites don't allow searching for today. Anyone know where it is possible?</p> 
6872	Intuitive Trip planning websites where you can "pin" interesting activities, hostels etc based on location?	<p>Just had this idea came in mind, where you can find great pictures, activities and stories etc online, collect them together, and group them based on location(eg. neighbourhood, city or country? I'm planning my trip to Europe right now, and that seems the best way to organize everything together. I wonder if such service exists?</p> 
2723	Recommendations For a Hotel - Venice, Italy	<p>I am planning a trip to Venice with a friend and would like to know of a really nice hotel to stay in.</p>  <p>About us: We are both in our early 30's, love great food and cocktail bars. We like to spend out evenings dancing away and our daytimes taking in the culture of the places we visit.</p>  <p>So a hotel in a livelier area of the city would suit, budget isn't really an issue, unless they expect £500 per night, that would be out of both of our price ranges. Ideally I would be looking to spend around EUR 100 - EUR 150 per night, based on a 4 night stay, especially seeing as this is for my friends birthday, I will be paying for both rooms. I also plan to travel the last weekend in January.</p>  <p>I look forward to replies.</p>  <p>(Just to clear up any confusion, my friend and I are of the opposite sex, so while I would sleep anywhere as long as its clean, she would like something a little more classy :))</p> 
9164	Are there some places I can stay for free in South Korea besides couch surfing?	<p>I'm thinking of going home to Australia from Europe/Turkey via Korea because... well Korea is awesome and it's on the way home (-:</p>  <p>But I'm almost out of money. Then again I was just talking to someone this morning here in Romania who stayed for free in some kind of farm in Corsica. I think she was camping there and didn't even have to help work on the farm.</p>  <p>But I don't mind working at all. I'm totally open to a work or volunteer in exchange for a free bed or a free place to put up my tent in a field.</p>  <p>I know couch surfing is an option but I'm looking for something where I don't have to worry about overstaying my welcome every three days and I'm also really interested in how farming and rural life is in Korea.</p> 
9266	Will I be able to enter South Korea as a tourist with a one-way ticket and no ticket home yet?	<p>I've been to South Korea a few times already and always enjoy it but I've always had an onward ticket before.</p>  <p>Now I need to fly home from a trip that's lasted over a year, but I still want to take my time and keep my options open.</p>  <p>There's a good choice of cheap flights from Istanbul to Seoul and from Seoul I can't decide yet whether to fly straight home or take a ferry to China, hitchhike to Guangzhou, and get a cheap flight home from there.</p>  <p>I can't really just buy the China-Australia flight now because I'm not sure yet whether I'll be able to get the Chinese visa easily enough or how long my remaining money will last.</p>  <p><strong>I know Korea, like most countries, has rules saying you need an onward ticket</strong>, but in my experience <strong>many countries never try to verify that you have this ticket</strong> unless you fit some profile. So in this instance I would find <strong>first-hand knowlegde</strong> much more informative that pointers to a government website.</p>  <p><strong>In practice does South Korea admit tourists with one-way tickets?</strong></p> 
1539	How can I effectively compare data plans available in a country?	<p>I'm going to spend 5½ months in Netherlands, and need to be able to make calls to Italy without spending a fortune.</p>  <p>After some hunting on Wikipedia I found that there are only three non-virtual operators in the country; I've since then started crawling the respective websites for information. Obviously, the operators all want to fish me for a 2-year subscription plan with smart phones and whatnot, while I "only" need a SIM card.</p>  <p>When those pages do give information about tariffs, they don't usually tell the full story either, and e.g. if I were to get tricked into getting a KPN sim card, I'd be paying €0.35/minute per national calls. You have to dig deeper to find out the plans costs <a href="http://www.kpn.com/prive/mobiel/Tarieven/prepaid-1.htm"><em>€2.5/MB</em> for data</a>, and <a href="http://www.kpn.com/prive/mobiel/Tarieven/buitenland.htm"><em>€1.16/minute</em></a> for calls to Italy. Whoa.</p>  <p>On the other hand there are too-good-to-be-true offers like <a href="http://www.t-mobile.nl/prepaid/internationaal/tarieven/engels">this one from T-Mobile</a>, promising €0.24 (fixed cost for 30 minutes... per call? cumulative? who knows!) domestic calls plus €0.19 + €0.09/minute calls to Italy which <em>has</em> to have a horrible catch hidden somewhere in the small print of the Dutch-only contract.</p>  <p>Is there a resource that does compare mobile plans more clearly? I personally need it for the Netherlands, but if you can find a service/website/service that covers more countries, all the better! Bonus points for a site in English, but if the site makes sense through Google Translate I won't mind too much.</p> 
2271	Quickest way from London to Dubai without flying?	<p>This is a question from a friend not (yet!) on Travel.SE...</p>  <p>From London, what is the quickest way to get to Dubai (via trains, buses, ferries etc) without flying?</p>  <p>(My usual advice of "just check <a href="http://www.seat61.com/">Seat61</a>" seems to fall down in this case, as they don't seem to have a UAE entry in their destination list...)</p> 
8138	What are the options for a prepaid SIM card in Germany?	<p>I'll be staying in Berlin for one month and I have an unlocked iPhone (GSM) that I'd like to use while I'm here. What are my choices for SIM cards and packages that include data?</p> 
4887	Best world destinations for dating - a website?	<p>During a recent trip to Zacatecas, Mexico, I noticed many people (particularly women) staring at me.  There was also a notable lack of other Caucasians around, even in comparison to Guadalajara, Mexico, where I have spent significant time (and had relatively fewer stares).  This lead to a conversation with a Mexican friend of mine who admitted that she, and other Mexican women, tend to find American men more attractive, both physically, and relationally.</p>  <p>So this is the lead-in to my tongue-in-cheek question:</p>  <p>Are there any resources I can use to find out where in the world I am the most attractive?  Or stated another way: Where should I travel if I want to find the easiest date?</p>  <p>I envision a search engine that allows input something like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I am a <strong>[man]</strong> from <strong>[the USA]</strong> who speaks <strong>[English]</strong> as a primary language, and am interested in <strong>[single]</strong>  <strong>[women]</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And it would then show me a list of localities (at least countries, if not regions/cities) where single women are especially attracted to people in my demographic.</p> 
2	How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle?	<p>This was one of our definition questions, but also one that interests me personally: How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle? I'd love to explore the Amazon but would not attempt it without a guide, at least not the first time. And I'd prefer a guide that wasn't going to ambush me or anything :P</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I don't want to go anywhere "touristy".  Start and end points are open, but the trip should take me places where I am not likely to see other travellers / tourists and where I will definitely require a good guide in order to be safe.</p> 
2127	How to get from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport into Helsinki city centre?	<p>How to get from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport into Helsinki city centre quickly and without paying too much for it?</p>  <p>Bonus question: how about if the flight arrives in the wee hours (say, at 03:00 am)?</p> 
3442	Jeju Island (New Natural Wonder of the World) - How to Get There?	<p>Jeju Island has just been provisionally named as one of the <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/158972/the-new-7-wonders-of-the-world-are/" rel="nofollow">new 7 Natural Wonders of the World</a>.</p>  <p>But how does one get there?

1304	Is there wifi in Astana Airport (Kazakhstan)?	<p>I have several hours stopover there tomorrow night. I'm debating sleeping in the airport or sleeping in a hotel - I can sleep anywhere, but if there's wifi in the airport that would seal the deal for me :D  </p>  <p>However I can't seem to find out definitively if there is wifi in the airport - free or not - the wiki article is rather sparse.</p> 
1504	Will an Iranian or Kuwaiti visa or stamp in my passport pose a problem on a future visit to Israel?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1497/are-there-any-repercussions-from-having-an-israeli-stamp-in-my-passport">this question I learned that entering Kuwait with an Israeli stamp in your passport will be a problem</a>. (Less surprising was that Iran doesn't like them either).</p>  <p>Later during my current trip I am hoping to visit Kuwait via Iran and I certainly intend to visit Israel at some point in the future.</p>  <p>Since these issues are often but not always reciprocal I would like to know if the Kuwait stamp will be a problem when visiting Israel or if they are less fussy than the reverse.</p>  <p>I'm expecting that the Iran stamp will definitely be a problem for an Israel visit but I'd be glad to be proven wrong.</p> 
9354	Can I drive in Spain using my U.S. (New York State) license?	<p>I know I can get an IDP, but I read in some places that they recognize US Driver's Licenses specifically New York.  Can anyone confirm?</p> 
758	Can I rent a camper in the US/Canada with a European B license?	<p>We are considering a holiday in North America with a camper. I have a European driver's license (B) which allows me to drive personal cars up to 3500 kg, although I can imagine that an average camper easily weighs more.</p>  <p>Does my license qualify me to drive a camper? If not, can I take an American/Canadian driver's test which would allow me to drive a camper?</p> 
145	When and where do I have the highest chance of seeing auroras?	<p>I'm wondering what time of year is best, and what locations might be best, for catching the aurora.</p>  <p>I'm currently thinking of February up at Sweden's ice hotel, but since the whole point of the trip is so that my wife can see the Aurora, I want to pick a location that affords the best chances to see one.</p>  <p>Edit: Just adding a link so you can see realtime aurora activity in the northern hemisphere</p>  <p><a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast/3">http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast/3</a></p>  <p>I know this is anecdotal, but I ended up going to Iceland in late february during the new moon and saw the aurora 3 out of 6 nights I was there.  There was activity every single night but the biggest problem was weather.  It was cloudy almost every single night. </p> 
7744	Free / cheap ways to get airport lounge access?	<p>Until recently, I had a complimentary <a href="http://www.prioritypass.com/">Priority Pass</a> card. Although the Priority Pass lounges aren't generally great, they are better than nothing when travelling on an airline where you don't have frequent flyer status.</p>  <p>Priority Pass is extremely expensive, however, and to me at least isn't worth paying for.</p>  <p>What other free or cheap ways are there of getting access to a lounge apart from Priority Pass and having frequent flyer status? I live in the UK, if it's relevant.</p> 
1014	How can I avoid or minimize jet lag?	<p>From my personal anecdotal experience, I've found it worse when travelling east around the globe.  I also tend to stay awake most if not all of the flight, so sleeping time doesn't tend to matter as the flights from London to NZ are minimum 28 hours.  Shorter flights you can arrange around daylight hours to reduce this, but otherwise, there must be better strategies to help out with.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>So I was fine despite nearly 48 hours of non-sleep from Mongolia to London, up the next 3 days at 8am to do stuff. However, the <em>second</em> week has been awful, sleepless nights and erratic sleepiness.

7982	What kind of passport do I need when entering the USA?	<p>I heard that you need a biometric passport if you want to enter USA.

709	Do I have to visit the Chinese consulate in person to get my visa?	<p>I'm planning a trip to Shanghai to visit some friends in about 5 months.  I understand that I will need to get a visa issued so that I can travel to China.</p>  <p>This will be the first time I've applied for a visa, so I'm not 100% sure how to go about doing this.  According to <a href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/hzqz/zgqz/t84246.htm">the Chinese embassy in the US website</a>, mailed applications are not accepted.</p>  <p>There is a Chinese consulate a few hours from where I live, so I figured I'd take a road trip and get everything taken care of in-person.</p>  <p>Am I going about this the correct way, or is there a better way to get the visa?</p> 
7530	Any tips for completing purchases through RENFE's website?	<p>I've found the Spanish train website <a href="http://www.renfe.com" rel="nofollow">renfe.com</a> cannot complete credit card transactions.

9589	How can I tell if a visa agent is trustworthy?	<p>I'm about to apply for a visa for an upcoming trip to China, so I'm looking into visa agents - those companies that will accept your passport and application documents by FedEx or UPS (etc.) shipment, submit the application on your behalf, pick up the passport with visa and ship it back to you. Because the process involves parting company with my passport, I want to be very certain that whatever visa agent I use will keep it secure and return it in the time frame that they say they will. Plus, of course, I also would like to know that I'm not handing a couple hundred dollars off to a scam artist (though I know this is quite unlikely). How can I tell whether a visa agent I'm considering is trustworthy? Is there anything like an accreditation procedure or a list of visa agents which are known to be legitimate?</p>  <p>The reason I wonder about this is that I have some concerns about <a href="http://www.justindocument.com" rel="nofollow">one company</a> which was suggested (if not necessarily recommended) by a colleague. On their website, they say that a visa application at the Chinese consulate in New York costs $140 plus a $60 service fee for 10 business day processing, or $160 plus $85 for 4 day processing; however, when I emailed them to confirm this, they said that $140+$60 was for 15 day processing and $160+$85 was for 10 day processing. Also, their web page says that the visa requires a confirmation letter from my US employer (in my case, my university), but this is not listed as a requirement on the <a href="http://newyork.china-consulate.org/eng/lsyw/lszjx/sbqz/hcv/" rel="nofollow">consulate's web site</a>. I know these are minor things, but it's enough to make me wonder why these inconsistencies are there, and whether they're signs of something I should be concerned about.</p> 
9621	What is a good visa agent for obtaining a Chinese visa from the NY consulate?	<p>As a followup to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9589/how-can-i-tell-if-a-visa-agent-is-trustworthy">an earlier question</a>: I'm planning to travel to China shortly, and I'm looking into visa agents - those companies that will accept your passport and application documents by FedEx or UPS (etc.) shipment, submit the application on your behalf, pick up the passport with visa and ship it back to you. I want to be very certain that whatever visa agent I use will keep my passport secure and return it in the time frame that they say they will. Can anyone recommend a good visa agent which operates with the Chinese consulate in New York City? I'm primarily interested in a good record with respect to passport safety and prompt service; cost is a secondary concern.</p> 
4066	Can "Conch Republic" passports actually be used for anything?	<p>Since the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch_Republic#The_annexation_of_Seven_Mile_Bridge">Key Largo Debacle over Seven Mile Bridge</a>, there's been this 'Conch Republic' that even issues souvenir passports.</p>  <p>A <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2572280&amp;cid=38358702">comment on slashdot</a> inferred that some countries may actually take it seriously.</p>  <p>Is there any actual practical use for this 'passport', aside from trying to pretend you're something that you're not?</p>

7240	Would visiting North Korea as a tourist cause problems travelling anywhere else?	<p>You can take tours from China across into North Korea (<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/4152/101">or by train, in theory</a>) - but assuming you do and get your passport stamped, are there other countries that will hold this against you?</p>  <p>For example, if you visit Israel, certain other middle-east countries get a bit iffy about that, to the extent that I've heard people suggest you don't get Israel stamps in your passport.  I'm wondering if this applies to North Korea as well, with any countries?</p>  <p>To clarify, I don't mean 'iffy' like America may question you about drugs if you enter from Colombia, I mean 'iffy' as in they may turn you away at the border, or worse.</p> 
4410	Is it difficult to do a car border crossing in Kaliningrad Oblast?	<p>Assuming I have the correct visa and intend to drive in from the Polish side, should I anticipate any problems crossing the border quickly?</p>  <p>I ask because <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kaliningrad_Oblast" rel="nofollow">Wikitravel</a> says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You will need Russian visa. Even if you have one it may take days to get in by car.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Which makes me wonder why it might take days.</p> 
5605	A day at Dubai International Airport and the city?	<p>On my way to India I'm planning to stay one day in Dubai. I would arrive at 6am in the morning and leave at 3am the next day.</p>  <p>My naive plan is to lock my backpack at the airport and then walk into the city and around to see some of the architecture and then return to the airport in the evening.</p>  <p>So, two questions? Are there lockers or left luggage facilities at the airport? Is it possible to walk to/from the airport and in Dubai itself.</p>  <p>Is it worth spending more than a day, if I just want to look around a bit?</p> 
6104	Do microfibre towels dry quicker and absorb more water?	<p>I am going to be doing a tour of Europe, visiting like 20 countries in 49 days and staying in hostels and cheap hotels. Given all this travelling, I think it is possible that my towel may not always have enough time to properly dry. One of the items Kathmandu is selling is microfibre towels. The salesman claimed that they dry twice as fast and be able to absorb as much water as a towel of normal thickness. How accurate are these claims?</p>

9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.

Although the normal way of getting there is by either airplane (in winter) or ship (in summer), I've read some info that says it should be possible to get there by four-wheel drive, but none go into any detail.</p>  <p>So, the big question is: Can one drive to Barrow with a 4x4?  </p>

8834	Insurance and car rental in US	<p>I'm going to rent a car in California for a week soon and was wondering whether to purchase insurance along with the rental.

1925	Hostel accommodation in Geneva	<p>I'm struggling for choices of hostel accommodation in Geneva first weekend of December.  between hostel world, hostel bookers, YHA and Hi hostels there are only four options under (only just under) £30 per person per night.

9480	What's the difference between embassies and consulates?	<p>Today <a href="http://www.americablog.com/2012/09/romney-gets-capital-of-libya-wrong-in.html">Mitt Romney called Benghazi the capital of Libya</a> (it's Tripoli) and apparently mixed up consulates and embassies.  I thought it'd be a handy question to have on here, for those sorting out visas and the like when wondering about consulates and embassies.</p>  <p>So, the question - from a traveller's point of view, what's the difference between an embassy and a consulate, and what would you use each one for?</p> 
1098	Which embassy/consulate to contact when you need consular support for a family where the parents have different nationalities?	<p>This is a question we have asked our self a lot, but never found a proper answer. We are a couple with different nationalities, where our children have both. We are wondering which Embassy we should contact abroad in case we need consular support, or would the family in that case be split to get support from each embassy/consulate.  Luckily we haven't been in a situation, where we would need consular support. Hopefully we would never have to, but still it would be nice to know in case something happens.</p> 
2099	How to research facilities/ratings of US airport lounges online?	<p>For an upcoming trip, it looks like for my US departure I'll have access to more than one airport lounge. (One via FF status, a different via a credit card). This is a nice position to be in, but rather than treking round the airport from lounge to lounge to investigate them, I figured I ought to be able to get some idea about them in advance.</p>  <p>Finding out what lounges are in a given airport is usually straightforward, as the airport website tends to list them. Finding out if you can get access to a given lounge is a little bit trickier, but between the lounge's website and that of the airline and any credit cards you can normally get the answer. (The trickier queries probably warrant their own questions though!) What the lounges are like, and what facilities they have is the bit that's eluding me...</p>  <p>Within Europe, airport lounges tend to all have a fairly high common standard, with a few (typically flagship ones in the carriers home airport) proving amazing. In America, I've found the quality and facilities to vary dramatically, from shockingly basic to poor-European standard. Ideally I'd like to make a beeline for one of the latter given a choice, rather than the former!</p>  <p>I figure there probably are resources out there which list the facilities on offer (is there free wifi, are there free newspapers, are there free soft drinks, what about snacks, meals, alcoholic drinks etc). Possibly also rating them on decor and furnishings too, though I'm less worried about that. I'm not sure where to find such things though.</p>  <p>So, I'm wondering, how best should I go about researching the facilities and catering of American airport lounges online? Any good website or resources out there?</p> 
7744	Free / cheap ways to get airport lounge access?	<p>Until recently, I had a complimentary <a href="http://www.prioritypass.com/">Priority Pass</a> card. Although the Priority Pass lounges aren't generally great, they are better than nothing when travelling on an airline where you don't have frequent flyer status.</p>  <p>Priority Pass is extremely expensive, however, and to me at least isn't worth paying for.</p>  <p>What other free or cheap ways are there of getting access to a lounge apart from Priority Pass and having frequent flyer status? I live in the UK, if it's relevant.</p>

3346	Are there countries other than the Netherlands that support hitchhiking?	<p>According to the Internet, the Netherlands support hitchhiking by placing signs (see picture) in spots that are a good location for hitchhikers. Are there any other countries that have such great support for hitchhikers?</p>  <p>I'm not asking if it is easy in other countries to hitchhike, but I want to know if other governments make some similar effort (like installing signs, legalize hitchhiking or provide official information about hitchhiking) to support hitchhikers.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0PDo8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

1943	Can I use USD in Canada?	<p>I will go to Canada for the first time from the United States. I will use credit card as much as possible but I guess I need cash for small shops and cafes anyway. To avoid exchange money back and forth and ATM fees, I plan to cash some money in USD and carry it with me. As of today, 1 CAD = 1.0086 USD so it should be easy to convert currency. Do small retail stores in Toronto accept USD in cash? If so, how are their exchange rates?</p> 
8824	How to tip in the United States?	<p>Tipping customs in the United States can be surprising for people who travel there for the first time. It happened to me when I used a shuttle van service out of LAX a few years ago. To sum up the bias: I am French; a country where service charges are included and optional tips to waiters in restaurants are only a few euros.</p>  <p>Although I paid by credit card, the driver gave me a pen and a form on which I could write the tip amount. At that moment, I was really missing simple rules that could help me define how much a suitable tip could be.</p>  <p>Afterwards, I heard about different calculation tricks. Some people say it's 20%, others 18%; some suggest to double the sales tax.</p>  <ul> <li>Is the rule the same for all occasions to tip, or are there different amounts depending for a table service restaurant, the tip jar of a fast-food restaurant, a bar waiter, a taxi driver?</li> <li>When someone gives outstanding service although not used to get tips, how much is appropriate? For instance, we had an airport car rental shuttle bus driver calling a <strong>competitor</strong> rental company for us to see if they had cars available, since the rental company of that bus was sold out.</li> <li>Restaurants often add a gratuity for large parties. Are patrons expected to tip beyond this amount and how much?</li> </ul>

10197	How are customs duties handled by the Fedex "Baggage Free" service?	<p>Fedex offers a <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/fedexupdates/May-2011/baggage-free.html" rel="nofollow">baggage free</a> traveler's service.  It purports to ship your belongings to your destination rather than taking them on your person.</p>  <p>This raises a question:  </p>  <ol> <li><p>How are customs declarations and duties handled when the destination is in a different country?</p>  <p>Luggage you take across a border on your person seems to be considered to be "personal effects" by default and not subject to customs duties.  In contrast, items shipped across a border via courier seem to be considered by default to be some sort of commercial item to which a customs duty applies.  Which leads to the question:</p></li> <li><p>How do you ship personal effects across a border so that they are not assessed customs duties?</p></li> <li><p>Does Fedex treat "Baggage Free" shipments especially at the customs clearing stage of shipping?  Or, is it up to the sender to make some special customs declarations in order to avoid customs fees?</p></li> </ol> 
5312	How to successfully haggle / bargain in markets	<p>While I've done quite a bit of travel now and back myself to handle situations when it comes to border guards, sorting accommodation and / or transportation, one thing I still struggle to come to terms with is haggling in the markets, be it for food, clothing or other.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FImXq.jpg" alt="Image of haggling in a market"></p>  <p>Image © Peter Morgan, 2014 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356</a></p>  <p>What is the best way to go about this?

3598	What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?	<p>As we know, most countries require that visitors have a return or onward ticket as a condition of entry.</p>  <p>But often, depending on where you're from and which country you're visiting, you won't be asked to show such ticket.</p>  <p>Now many backpackers like to travel without exact plans made in advance, including buying all one-way tickets when they are finished with one country and have decided where to go next.</p>  <p><strong>But what happens when you're travelling this way and they actually do ask you for proof of return/onward passage?</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Are you sent back on the next plane at your own expense?</li> <li>Will you have some opportunity to buy a ticket at this time?</li> <li>Will this be unlikely to happen in the first place because the airport where you board will tell you whether you'll need a ticket?</li> </ul>  <p>To make it all specific, I'm asking about my friend travelling on an Iranian passport who wants to fly into Malaysia with a one way ticket and travel around Southeast Asia.</p>  <p>Personally I've never been asked to show this proof in an airport but I have at land borders after visa runs and in immigration offices when getting visa extensions. <strong>But</strong> a friend who travels on a British passport was asked for this proof when she flew into Malaysia about two years ago. Lucky for her it was a rare occasion where she actually did have a return ticket.</p>  <p><strong>What will Malaysia do if you are asked to prove onward/return travel but only have a one-way ticket?</strong></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I can't answer what Malaysia would do if they asked for such proof because when I arrived they did not ask.</p>  <p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, when I was checking in for my flight at the Air Asia X desk in Sydney they did ask me. And they did accept my $10 e-ticket for the train to Singapore as proof.</p> 
5695	Where is the safest place in a train?	<p>This morning I had to make a small (2-3 hours) train journey with a friend. He is a little anxious and unreasonable, and doesn't trust public transport. He won't fly at all and normally, he doesn't take the train, because he says it is too dangerous. Normally, he only trusts himself when he is the driver of his car. But today it was necessary to take the train.</p>  <p>During the journey, we had a discussion about the safest place in a train. I'm convinced that the safest places are in the back of the train, since normally, if a train has an accident, it either hits something head-on or the engine derails. So I assume that the impact is lower in the back of the train.</p>  <p>My friend argues that the places at the front of the train are safer. He has various reasons for that: </p>  <ol> <li>In case of emergency it is more probable that the electronic is working in front of the train. Therefore it is easier to open doors and get out of the train. He compares that with seats on a place directly around a emergency exit. </li> <li>The driver of a vehicle always protects his side unconsciously. I can follow this argument in case of a car, but how should it work in a train? </li> <li>Cars at the end of a train have a higher chance to derail.</li> </ol>  <p>So I'm not sure who is right. Are there any statistics about safest places in a train? I know that such things exists for planes, but how is it in trains? I would really like to persuade my friend, so that we can travel more together by train.</p> 
10247	Statistically, is there a safest seat on the plane if it crashes?	<p>So to clarify, there are lots of different planes, so for the sake of argument, there are areas:</p>  <ul> <li>front left</li> <li>front right</li> <li>front middle</li> <li>forward front, right, middle</li> <li>over the left wing</li> <li>over the right wing</li> <li>middle, between the wings</li> <li>mid-way back, left, right, or middle</li> <li>at the back left, right, or middle</li> <li>pilot seat</li> <li>co-pilot seat</li> <li>jump-seat, if it exists</li> </ul>  <p>So that's 18ish possible safe zones in the plane.  Is there a particular area that statistically people have survived more (or less) in?</p> 
10251	Can you visit the Lille Citadelle?	<p>Looking on a city centre map of Lille, I spotted a very interesting looking 5 point Citadelle at the edge of the old town, as handily shown by OSM:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XvADr.png" alt="http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/14/8330/5510.png"></p>  <p>I wandered over there, and saw some impressive looking walls and ramparts, but after a short walk round part of the surrounding park I couldn't spot anything about being able to go in.</p>  <p>Is the Citadelle generally open to tourists? And if not, are there any times when you can visit the inside of it?</p> 
6946	Countries with no visa requirements on its visitors	<p>Recently I learnt that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra">Andorra</a> has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Andorra">no visa restrictions</a> to its visitors (citizens of any country) and free to enter if they hold a passport or EU national identity card. </p>  <p>Are there any other country(ies) which have similar no visa restrictions for its visitors irrespective of citizenship? </p>  <p>PS: Though Andorra has not restrictions, one need to have a Schengen visa with multiple entry as its a land-locked country and only be accessed via Spain or France.</p> 
9562	Where to book Indian train tickets online?	<p>I've read that trains in India are very busy and its best to book in advance. So where is the best website to book online? I've found the site <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com">www.cleartrip.com</a> and <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com">www.makemytrip.com</a> - both of which seem to have a straight forward website, however I found loads of reviews that basically condemn them (i.e. <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/websites/Cleartrip-com-Reviews-925062909">http://www.mouthshut.com/websites/Cleartrip-com-Reviews-925062909</a>)</p>  <p>The journeys I need to book for November are:</p>  <p>Delhi - Varanasi Varanasi - Agra Agra - Jodhpur Jodhpur - Jaipur</p>  <p>Is it best to book online? If not what's the best way of booking?</p> 
5809	The most difficult countries to travel in?	<p>Now at first sight that's a subjective question.  But I'll explain now that it's not.  So please don't answer subjectively either!</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aTransport-dush-khorog.jpg"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DJ73e.jpg" alt="Pamir Highway between Dushanbe and Khorog, Tajikistan"></a></p>  <p><em>Pamir Highway between Dushanbe and Khorog, Tajikistan</em></p>  <p>When papers or publications release pieces about "the richest country" it's usually based on something - maybe GDP, or debt, for example.</p>  <p><a href="http://hitchwiki.org/">Hitch Wiki</a> gives each country a 'hitchability' rating, for example.  But that's only one form of travel, and there's not much granularity in the rating system.</p>  <p><a href="http://meandmychucks.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/which-kind-of-traveler-are-you/"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3UcEE.jpg" alt="generic hitching picture"></a></p>  <p><em>generic hitching picture</em></p>  <p>Is there a publication or source that through some moderately scientific calculation, publishes a list of the hardest (or easiest) countries to travel through?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ssqq.com/archive/vinlin27b.htm"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IK9zE.jpg" alt="Yungas Road or &quot;Death Road&quot; in Bolivia"></a></p>  <p><em>Yungas Road or "Death Road" in Bolivia</em></p>  <p>I'm not sure myself how you would measure this - but similarly, I'm not sure how you'd compare crime stats between countries. Yet news outlets, universities etc have found a way, with many studies. I'm expecting someone's come up with a 'scientific' way to do it, and I'm looking for that.</p> 
6532	Indian Railways-Online Reservation Rules	<p>I booked an online ticket for traveling on Indian Railways for a Short Distance Journey, but my ticket was not confirmed at all and is on the waiting list. </p>  <p>Can I travel with the waiting list ticket in the General Compartment?</p> 
8458	Cheap bus lines in Germany, something like Orangeways?	<p>Are there any cheap bus lines inside Germany? Something like <a href="http://www.orangeways.com">Orangeways</a>?</p>  <p>I've checked Deutsche Bahn cost for transport from Berlin to München and I was shocked with the price about 100 Euro. By Orangeways similar distance costs about 20 Euro... Is there any operator that allows to travel in Germany with so attractive prices?</p> 
5730	Subway, train or both when travelling around Tokyo	<p>We will spend a week in Tokyo in april and I am now looking into the best way to get around the city. The subway seems to go everywhere but there are also normal trains connecting most places. How does a JR pass compare to subway prices? Also - is it likely that we will use the subway anyway for some destinations? We will stay close to Ikeburo station which makes it easy to go by train. We may also do one or two day trips out of Tokyo by train. Mount Fuji or something like that.</p>

6605	Looking for a small scenic beach town village in Spain or Portugal	<p>A few friends and I are looking for a small Spain/Portugal beach town or village to stay at for a week.  We want something scenic, ideally with cliffs or terrain on the beach.  We are all 28 to 30 and looking to have a good time, but are more into laid back bars vs. loud clubs and crowds.   Something with a backpacker feel may work well.  Any suggestions?  We are going in early-mid Sept.   </p> 
10390	I am looking for a hotel search engine for rural areas	<p>I am trying to find a bucolic holiday destination, which means finding a nice hotel in a small beautiful village for spending some quiet time.  Most search engines are only finding major cities, and famous tourist-oriented places; for me one main factor is that it is not too far from the airport, and in my case I would like to find somewhere in southern Europe.</p>  <p><strong>I am looking for a hotel search engine for rural areas.</strong>   </p> 
10394	How many accommodation types are recognized in German?	<p>Next to the usual hotel aggregators like booking.com, expedia, etc I am using <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/10392/141">Google Maps</a> to search for accommodation. It really works well if you search for accommodation in the local language.  For French I am using the following key words: Gites, chambre/maison/table d'hôte, gite rural,<br> and I always find some nice places especially in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10390/i-am-looking-for-a-hotel-search-engine-for-rural-areas">bucolic</a> regions in France. </p>  <p>So far I have only have identified Ferienhaus in German, having less options being returned by Google Maps. What are the synonyms in German known for the different types of accommodation available in rural areas? </p> 
10379	Schengen visa refusal	<p>I got a multiple entry Schengen visa from 5-3-2011 to 5-9-2011 (valid for 6 months) last year during which I stayed for 42 days out of the allocated 90 days.</p>  <p>I again applied for a Schengen visa and I got it. I was given a Schengen visa from 17-9-2011 to 31-12-2012 for which I can stay up to 90 days.</p>  <p>I stayed for 82 days of the allocated 90 days for a Schengen visa and went out of the region without any question.</p>  <p>When I again applied for my new Schengen visa I was informed by the embassy that I overstayed during my stay in Schengen territories by 14 days.</p>  <p>The calculation they made was for the last 6 months. I applied on January 4th 2012 and they calculated from that day and informed me that I overstayed by 14 days and they rejected my visa.</p>  <p>In the last page of the passport they put some seal indicating application number for Schengen visa for which it was rejected.</p>  <p>Please let me know whether I will get a Schengen visa in the future as I am very much stressed about this. Also I have only a few pages left in the passport now. If I change my passport will it solve my problem?</p> 
10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
7273	Is it possible to travel to Cuba by sea (from e.g. Mexico)?	<p>When I was reading about Cuba around the time I visited there (2008), I got the impression that <strong>the only way in is by air</strong>.</p>  <p>Now, as of 2012, is this (still) the case? Or <strong>are there any cruises, ferries, or other sea travel options for reaching Cuba</strong>, legally, from some of the nearby counties? (Either for a day-trip or a longer visit.)</p>  <p>I mean, Mexico is close. So are Jamaica, Bahamas, and many other island nations. (And Florida, of course, but I suppose we can count that out for now.) You can easily fly to Havana from e.g. Kingston, Nassau, or Cancún—it'd only make sense if you could take a boat too.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OkUnp.png" alt="enter image description here"><br> <sup>Image from <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/">Bing Maps</a></sup></p>  <p>(For the purposes of this question, assume that the Cuban tourist card/visa is already sorted out.)</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p>

110	What is the best method for exchanging dollars for Euros?	<p>I'm traveling from the US to Europe in a few weeks.  <strong>What's the best method of exchanging dollars for Euros</strong>?  </p>  <p>I imagine there's options like:</p>  <ul> <li>at the airport when you arrive in Europe</li> <li>at a bank in the US before you leave</li> <li>at a bank in Europe upon arriving</li> </ul> 
2686	Flying within the United States, Passport required?	<p>This month I'll be flying twice within the United States. I am a US citizen with a valid drivers license, flying within US boundaries. Is this sufficient to fly? I haven't held a valid passport for over 12 years and am uncertain of the flying restrictions in this day and age. Will I be OK to fly without my Passport?</p> 
8686	Is AirBNB legal and legit in Canada?	<p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/7859/1264">This answer</a> mentions AirBNB technically being illegal in New York and that causing issues sometimes with unprompted withdrawal of rentals.  Are they legal in Canada, and specifically Toronto?</p> 
10546	Do Turkish citizens need a visa to come to the UK for one day?	<p>I may need to go to the UK for a day. I live in Turkey and I am a Turkish citizen. Do I need a visa to come to the UK for only one day?</p> 
3330	Do I have to pay traffic fines issued by foreign governments?	<p>I live in Italy and I own a car registered in Italy as well.</p>  <p>Next year I'm planning a long stay in the US (around 6 months) and I want to bring my car with me.</p>  <p>I was wondering, can I abuse carpool lanes, not pay parking spaces, break the speed limit etc etc with no consequences (while still driving safely ofc)?</p>  <p>If they give me a fine, is it just trash paper or can they somehow force me to pay?</p>  <p>(What I want to avoid is basically going back to the US 20 years from now and getting arrested for that, or something similar)</p> 
16	Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?	<p>My wife and I have decided to move across Europe by train. Do you know of any good sites for planning a trip via train (schedule and maybe prices)? We're going to go across Europe from east (Russia and Baltic countries) to west (France and Germany).<br> I've found only <a href="http://www.oebb.at/">http://www.oebb.at/</a>.</p> 
3521	5 hours in Amsterdam	<p>I have a 5-hour layover at AMS on a Saturday evening (16:00-21:00), on an intra-EU itinerary to the UK.  I'd like to leave the airport and have dinner in town. </p>  <ul> <li>Is this reasonable?  (From reading the travel wiki article, it looks like this is plenty of time to take the train into the city and back.)</li> <li>Ideally I would like to find a restaurant that is popular, not expensive, and <strong>quintessentially Dutch</strong> (i.e. traditional).  I am looking for restaurant recommendations in particular, or recommendations on where to find decent recommendations. (The travel wiki article's 'eating' listings are pretty sparse.)</li> </ul> 
8482	Find direct flights to specific airport for specific date (from any departure airport)	<p>I try to minimise my flying, and have done all my travel without flying for the past couple of years, in order to minimise my environmental impact. I've decided to allow myself a holiday by flight next Christmas, but to still minimise environmental impact, I want to limit the flying to one leg (one leg down, one leg back). I will travel overland to and from the airports (even if this takes 1–2 days). Therefore, I'm looking for a flight search engine that will give me a reliable answer as to direct flights to a particular airport for a particular date. Where can I find such a search engine?</p>  <p>Case in question: flights to either Santa Cruz de La Palma or Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain on Friday 21 December. Googling gave me <a href="http://www.flyhere.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyhere.com</a> but I know the answer is incorrect, because I know both Berlin-Tegel and Amsterdam-Schiphol have direct flights to this airport on 2012-12-21, however neither are listed there. Either I travel a short distance by train and fly directly from Scandinavia to Tenerife and take a ferry from there, or I travel further south by train and fly directly to La Palma (probably from Germany).</p>  <p>So: where can I find a flight timetable for direct-flight arrivals at a particular airport at a particular date?</p>

9364	Rooftop bar in Manhattan?	<p>Currently I'm in New York. I'm looking for a rooftop bar that provides a great overview about Manhattan, but is still affordable. (20 dollar for cocktail at maximum.) Additionally, I want to go there wearing jeans and a t-shirt, so nothing too fancy.</p> 
8912	How do you avoid the hefty toll fee on the French highways?	<p>Some of the toll fee's on the French highways are hefty. I know that you can avoid them by taking the routes nationales, where some are almost like highways. I don't mind traveling a little bit longer to save money, but the 6 hours to drive 150 km I drove today to save 20 Euro was too much. Is there an easy way to determine when it is worth taking the secondary roads or when it is better to just pay the "péage".</p> 
9793	Camera store near Split, Croatia?	<p>I'm travelling in Croatia with my Canon 5D Mark II, and I forgot my charger at home. Is there a store in or around Split that would sell such a thing?</p>

What do you suggest me? I would prefer to see not only big buildings but also some traditional Arabic stuff.</li> <li>Is it easy for an Italian to get a visa at the airport? How much does it cost?</li> <li>Will I find some problem due to the fact that I'll be there on Friday? </li> </ol></li> </ul> 
10532	Does the hotel need to be fully prepaid before applying for a Swiss tourist visa?	<p>I am an international student now studying in the UK, and I need a visa for traveling to Switzerland.</p>  <p>The visa application requires a confirmed hotel reservation, but it hasn't mentioned what kind of rate should be. I actually have two options to book an hotel, the first one is fully prepaid and non-refundable; the second is very flexible - where I can cancel or change it any time before arrival date.</p>  <p>My question is - what kind of booking should I do? the fully pre-paid one or the flexible one?</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
890	Is there any trick to checking in more weight on planes?	<p>I soon have to move from France to Spain, one way no coming back. And as with most of the airlines carriers in Europe I am allowed at 23Kg checked-in and 10Kg on board with me. Packing lifetime stuff in 33Kg is not an easy task.</p>  <p>I was wondering if some of you have trick to either check in more weight or any other trick so they can go with more kilos.</p> 
4632	How to deal with excess baggage?	<p>I might have some excess bagage on my next flight with KLM. According to KLM's website excess baggage could be checked in online with a 20% discount. </p>  <p>Are there other options? Long, long ago there was always the option of sea mail. This is no longer offered. </p>  <p>What are alternatives for sending excess bagage cheaper then taking it with me on the flight?</p> 
10930	Can I take chocolate to Australia?	<p>Australia is well known for having very strict rules on what food and plant-based materials can be brought into the country, to try to keep the country free of diseases. Some food/animal/plant things can never be brought into the country, some may be if suitably declared, and a very small number are always fine.</p>  <p>What's the situation with chocolates though? I'd quite like to take a nice box of chocolates with me as a gift for someone when I go to Australia, but only if I'll be allowed to take them in. Does anyone know what the rules are for chocolates? Are they a never / usually ok if declared / normally fine thing?</p> 
10931	Are there websites which do last minute accomodation deals in Australia?	<p>I'm heading out to Australia fairly soon, and for the start of my trip I'm hopefully staying with friends. However, there's a small chance that that won't be possible. I might find out when changing planes in the far east, but there's a chance I'll step off the flight in Sydney to get a voicemail from my friends saying "sorry, we can't pick you up after all, hopefully see you in a few days"....</p>  <p>I know that for some cities, there are websites that do very very last minute hotel deals, to shift unsold rooms for that night. Are there any that cover Australia (Sydney especially, if that matters). Otherwise, are there any good ways to find sensibly priced accommodation at the very last moment for Australia?</p>  <p>(My flight doesn't land until about 9pm, so I'll be too late to cancel a refundable hotel booking if I can stay with my friends as planned)</p> 
10928	Is it okay to bring a bottle of champagne on an airplane (as checkin luggage)?	<p>Can you bring a bottle of champagne with you as luggage (not as hand luggage)? Or would the pressure pose a risk and as a result not be allowed?</p> 
3596	Places to stop off along the Sydney to Brisbane railway?	<p>I'm hoping this is a constrained enough question to not produce either long lists, or lots of subjective answers, so here goes...</p>  <p>In December I'm going to want to get from Sydney to Brisbane. I won't have a car, and it's just a one way trip, so the obvious choices would seem to be either fly, or take the train. (Well, train then bus from Casino!) While the train looks to be slightly cheaper, when luggage fees are included, I've noticed that a <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/discovery">CountryLink East Coast Discover Pass</a> is about the same price as the flight + bag fees.</p>  <p>If I was to get a <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/discovery">CountryLink East Coast Discover Pass</a>, then I'd be able to make my way from Sydney up to Brisbane by train + bus, stopping as often as I like (as long as I don't backtrack). My idea was to maybe take something like 3-4 days to do the trip, stopping at a couple of places along the way (plus charging my gadgets up too - one snag I hit last time with the train is the lack of power points!)</p>  <p>What I'm not sure on is where along the North Coast that's served by CountryLink is worth stopping at for a day? I won't have a car with me, nor will I have that long, so visiting some of the more far-flung beaches is out. Between Sydney and Grafton I'm largely limited to two trains a day (I don't think I'll want to take the overnight one), and for the Garfton to Brisbane leg I've no real choice (XPT to Casino then bus looks the only sensible bet). The <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/timetables">timetable listing is here</a>, and <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/17259/NorthCoastRegion-23_Oct_2011.pdf">this is the current timetable</a></p>  <p>For places to stop off at, they'd need sensibly priced accommodation near the station, as I'll likely not be packed for long walks with everything. I wouldn't mind a stop that would allow for some scuba diving, but otherwise places with one of interesting walking, a nice beach or a museum would be good. Oh, and I probably wouldn't stop at Surfers or anywhere north of there, as I can pop back to them from Brisbane later! I guess in addition to a whole day stop, I could always get the earlier Casino XPT, hop off for a couple of hours and see somewhere, then take the later Grafton XPT on to where I'm staying, so suggestions for somewhere for a museum / quick walk / etc might also be good!</p>  <p>So, along the route covered by the discovery pass, are there any places that would be recommended for a 1 day stop? And anywhere that might be interesting for a few hours?</p>

882	Shipping my car from Europe to Canada or the U.S	<p>The plan is to drive my car (<a href="http://0.tqn.com/d/4wheeldrive/1/0/O/L/1/Alek_Ser_04LadaNiva_2RR.jpg">a small 4x4</a>) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay">Prudhoe Bay</a><sup>1</sup> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhorse,_Alaska">Deadhorse</a>), Alaska to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn">Cape Horn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> in Chile. I will be travelling for an undetermined duration, with a minimum of two years. (I know it can be done a lot faster, but it's about the journey, the destination is just an excuse).</p>  <p>We will leave in the first week of January, 2013. For various reasons, I've decided to bring my own car. So, I'll need to ship it from Europe to Canada.</p>  <p><br/> <strong>My questions are:</strong>  </p>  <ul> <li>Has anybody shipped a car between Europe and Canada or the U.S.?  </li> <li>What kind of cost am I looking at?  </li> <li>Any gotchas I need to know about?</li> </ul>  <p><br/> <strong>Quick Update</strong><br> I'll be shipping from wherever is the cheapest option in Europe (mainland) and shipping to the cheapest option in Canada or the U.S.</p>  <p><br/> <strong>Extra Information</strong><br> Many people suggested buying a car in either Canada or Alaska. But that does not answer the question I was asking : ) The car has some very nice base characteristics (very small, very good off-road ability, cheap) and in addition has special modifications for long range independent travel (such as, but not limited to, extended fuel- and water tanks) and in addition, I know this car's history so I can make an informed estimate about it's reliability. <em>So, I've decided to bring this car</em>. The question is now, what's the best/cheapest option to ship it.</p>  <p>I will likely <em>not</em> re-register the car in the U.S. nor Canada. I've heard from several travellers that it increases hassle if your car is registered in a different country than you live in, so, for now, the plan is to keep the car registered in my home country.</p>  <p><sub><sup>1)</sup> I Actually wanted to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow,_Alaska">Barrow</a>, but it turn out the 200 miles between there and Deadhorse are <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7798/getting-to-barrow-alaska-overland">an expedition in itself</a></sub>.</p>

4720	Where to nap in Chicago O'Hare?	<p>I am bracing myself for a rough trip: getting up at 4AM, taking a 3 hour flight, then a 13 hour flight, with a 5.5 hour layover in between.</p>  <p>I can almost never sleep on planes, so this trip would go down smoother if I could get a decent nap during the layover at Chicago O'Hare. What are my options?</p>  <p>I'd be particularly happy if there are any lounges I can pay my way into that have sleep rooms and/or showers. </p>  <p>EDIT: There are showers in one of the two AA Admirals' Clubs, according to <a href="http://www.loungeguide.net/wiki/u/Chicago_%28ORD%29_American_Airlines_Admirals_Club_%28Concourses_H/K%29" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="http://www.lounges.net/Chicago-%28ORD%29-Airport-Lounges/" rel="nofollow">pages</a>. They also have cell-phone free quiet rooms. If anybody's been in them, I'd love to hear your opinion on how quiet they were, and whether they're good for naps.</p> 
10495	Extending an expiring I-94W, land based entry to US	<p>I live in Canada with a German passport and a student visa. From a recent climbing trip to the US I still have this green I94-W form in my passport. I didn't surrender it on leaving the US back to Canada, because I expected to come back for another climbing trip relatively soon. </p>  <p>That trip got postponed a few times, and now the situation is that the I94-W would expire while I'm on the trip. That is, it would still be valid on entry, but not on exit. </p>  <p>Can I apply for a new I94-W at the border crossing, or can these Visa waivers not be extended back-to-back?</p>

10931	Are there websites which do last minute accomodation deals in Australia?	<p>I'm heading out to Australia fairly soon, and for the start of my trip I'm hopefully staying with friends. However, there's a small chance that that won't be possible. I might find out when changing planes in the far east, but there's a chance I'll step off the flight in Sydney to get a voicemail from my friends saying "sorry, we can't pick you up after all, hopefully see you in a few days"....</p>  <p>I know that for some cities, there are websites that do very very last minute hotel deals, to shift unsold rooms for that night. Are there any that cover Australia (Sydney especially, if that matters). Otherwise, are there any good ways to find sensibly priced accommodation at the very last moment for Australia?</p>  <p>(My flight doesn't land until about 9pm, so I'll be too late to cancel a refundable hotel booking if I can stay with my friends as planned)</p> 
8607	Feeling the spirit of Helsinki, where?	<p>When I visit a city, besides visiting the main tourist attractions, I usually like to see some places that can make me feel the true spirit of the place I'm visiting.</p>  <p>As an example, if you visit Pisa the square of the leaning tower is of course the main attraction but the inhabitants of the city usually go out in other zones, some of them quite far from the common tourist tracks. In Budapest you can find people playing chess at the thermal baths, and so on.</p>  <p>Now I'm planning to visit Helsinki and I'd like some suggestion about what are the places and the activities that most of the inhabitants love. For example: do they gather for picnic in certain areas? Do they have trip to some zones of the city? Is there something that if you see you say "this could be Helsinki and only Helsinki"?</p>  <p>To narrow the question and be a little bit clearer, I'm not speaking about particular events but just common life of the ordinary inhabitants of the city.</p> 
6955	What are the "rules" for multi-city flights?	<p>As I understand things, airlines generally give discounts for round-trips that consist of a flight from A to B followed by a flight from B to A.  How does this logic work for multi-city flights?  As an example (but don't focus strictly on this example), what about a flight from A to B followed by a flight from C back to A?  What logic is applied to determine whether to charge as separate one-way trips or as a discounted multi-city trip?  Is the important part that the trip begin and end in the same space, or does there need to be an unbroken cycle?</p>  <p>I know I can prod travel search engines for specific examples, but if I understand the rules it can help in my search.  Is this airline dependent?  Does it matter whether the flights are domestic or international (I'm only concerned here about domestic)?</p> 
10706	Travel between Ho Chi Minh City and Kampot	<p>I'm looking for a relatively painless but interesting way to get from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Kampot in Cambodia. </p>  <p>The most commonly suggested route seems to be the bus from HCMC to Phnom Pehn, and then Phnom Pehn to Kampot. My main concern with this is that the early buses seem to arrive in Phnom Pehn around 1330, and the last ones to Kampot seem to leave about 1430, which doesn't leave much of a window for delays on the first leg. Also, we intend to go back to Pnomh Pehn so don't really want to do the same route twice.</p>  <p>I have heard there are busses from HCMC to Ha Tien, but can't find much in the way of times/where they leave from. Can anyone advise on these? getting from Ha Tien to Kampot seems straightforward.</p>  <p>How can we arrange a shared minibus to Ha Tien?</p>  <p>If all else fails, what would be a ball park figure for a taxi/driver cost from HCMC to Ha Tien?</p> 
5576	Visiting a lounge in T1 at Dubai International Airport, during a layover at T3?	<p>For an upcoming trip, I have a layover of 2.5 hours in Dubai. Both flights are with Emirates, and arrive / leave from Terminal 3.</p>  <p>As the first flight is overnight, I'll want to freshen up, and a shower would be ideal. Through my credit card, I have access to a lounge in T3 which doesn't offer showers (plus apparently has really slow wifi), or a lounge in T1 which does have a shower (and apparently has both better wifi and better food). So, the lounge in T1 sounds better for more needs than the T3 one.</p>  <p>What I'm not sure of is if I can make it from T3 to T1 and back again, with enough time to spend in T1 to make it worth going?</p>  <p>(I guess I'll need to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure for the connecting flight, for an Emirates international departure? If so, that'd give me about 2 hours from stepping off the plane, assuming it's on time, until I need to be back in T3 at the gate)</p>

5479	Is it safe to stay outside the Boulevard Périphérique in Paris?	<p>I'm planning on staying in Paris with my wife for a few days in April. I've found a number of hotels for a reasonable price and with overall good reviews on TripAdvisor. But all of them are located in the area outside the Boulevard Périphérique. I have been told that the crime rate is higher in that part of the city (mostly petty theft, robbery and burglary). So, I'm considering staying at a more central hotel (and paying considerably more, of course).</p>  <p>More specifically, most hotels are on the North and East suburbs. Three of them near the Gallieni‎ station, one near the Garibaldi station, one near the Porte de la Chapelle station and one near Vanves-Malakoff train station.</p>  <p>Am I being too paranoid? Is it safe, for example, to come back walking to the hotel at night?</p> 
3325	How to find "night and day" decongestant for a head cold when there's a language barrier?	<p>So I've been in Tbilisi, Georgia for almost a week and the temperature is now dropping below zero Celsius sometimes and I have the dubious honour of being the first in my hostel to contract a head cold.</p>  <p>I need some medicine but I dislike medicine, especially cold medince, and am very particular about what I want. But I have no idea if it's available in this part of the world like it is in Australia, plus there is the language barrier making it hard to explain even to my fellow travellers, let alone in the pharmacy.</p>  <p>I only want decongestant. I do not want cold medicine with other ingredients such as expectorants etc.</p>  <p>I like the kind which is sold in Australia by various companies as "Night and Day" cold and flu medicine, equivalents are readily available including generics. Here are some I can find after lots of internet searching:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.codral.com.au/CodralDayNightNewFormula.aspx" rel="nofollow">Codral Day &amp; Night New Formula</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.sudafed.com.au/products/adult/sinus-pressure-pain/sudafed-pe-sinus-day-night-relief" rel="nofollow">Sudafed® PE Sinus Day + Night Relief</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.demazin.com.au/demazin-for-adults/pe-day-night-tablets" rel="nofollow">Demazin PE Day &amp; Night tablets</a></li> <li><a href="http://inovapharma.com.au/products/australia/consumer-healthcare/cough-cold.aspx" rel="nofollow">Nyal Cold &amp; Flu Fighter Day &amp; Night</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.dimetapp.com.au/adult/adult-cough-and-cold-products.html#tab4" rel="nofollow">Dimetapp Daytime/Nightime</a></li> </ul>  <p>They come in a box with a ratio of 2:1 day tablets to night tablets. The day tablets contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, while the night tablets contain another ingredient which has the welcome side effect of drowsiness.</p>  <p>Is such a product widely available around the world? If not what should I look for instead? And how should I explain what I want to a pharmacist who is likely only to speak Georgian and Russian?</p>  <p>I'm very sure that I only want to medicate the runny/blocked nose symptom.</p> 
11086	When booking a hotel via an opaque site, is there any way to increase the chances of getting free wifi?	<p>Following on from my question on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10931/are-there-websites-which-do-last-minute-accomodation-deals-in-australia">last minute accommodation deals in Australia</a>, I ended up booking something about 20 minutes before boarding my flight, which didn't leave a lot of time for research... I spotted a nice sounding 4* place on an opaque hotel booking site for not much more than a shared room in a hostel! The hotel offered a pool and spa, which sounded tempting after 24 hours flying, so I opted for that. The only snag was discovering that they wanted 1/3 of the nightly rate for wifi! Luckily the cafe next door has free wifi, and does very nice coffee :)</p>  <p>Opaque hotel booking sites (also known as "hidden hotels", "secret hotels" etc) can be great, because you can get some stunningly good deals as hotels shift excess rooms (some money is better than no money for an empty room!). However, to avoid undercutting the main hotel's booking, they don't tell you what hotel you'll be booking, just the area it's in (can be very big!), and some headline facilities of the hotel.</p>  <p>Is there any way when booking through an opaque booking site to increase your chances of getting somewhere with free wifi? Or at least cheap wifi? Or is this just a risk you take when using opaque sites (such as the rates almost never including breakfast)?</p>

1154	Does a Singaporean Student Pass visa card need to be surrendered when it expires?	<p>Singaporean Long Term Pass visas (such as Training Employment Pass, Student Pass, etc that allow you to go through automated border control clearance) state that the biometric visa card must be surrendered when it expires or when a new one is issued; otherwise, it technically counts as an overstaying offence if you come back to Singapore. Is this rule enforced strictly? I will be flying out of Singapore before my long term pass expires, but I might come back in a few months for work or travelling.</p> 
11240	Is free wifi easy to find in the centre of Brisbane?	<p>While in Sydney, I noticed that free wifi wasn't that common. Some places did have it, a few others had an anonymous named wifi that you could get the password for if you knew to ask, and quite a few had paid-for wifi.</p>  <p>I'm now up in Brisbane, and I'm wondering if it'll be a similar thing. Is free wifi more common here? Either municipal provided, or from cafes etc? Or is it much the same as in Sydney?</p>

8803	Are flights actually cheaper *to book* during the week?	<p>Last week I was eyeing up flights to Vegas from Vancouver.  I had vaguely chosen the flight that I wanted. On Saturday I found that the flights I wanted weren't there, and in general, it was more expensive than before.  I checked again on Sunday, same thing.  I then remembered some anecdotal statement that airlines put prices up on weekends.</p>  <p>Monday was a public holiday, so I wasn't sure how that would go. Sure enough, flights were still up, but this could be just that all flights had gone up in price.</p>  <p>Come Tuesday, back to work, and I checked. The flight that I'd been eyeing up the previous week was back down to the price I wanted, and more cheap flights were available.</p>  <p>Of course, this is only one anecdotal moment. Are there studies or statements from airlines online somewhere where there's documented evidence that they do this on purpose? </p>  <p>(Further anecdotal evidence will not be accepted as an answer)</p> 
10277	Accepted student with long sejour visa (OFII) to France, but arriving as tourist	<p>I have been accepted as student for the 2013 January intake. Since the “lettre de attestation” says the program will start by the 4th of January I suppose my visa will be valid just before the program starts (I am already in the visa application process). However I bought a flight ticket with my family for the 17th of December arriving in France and staying for two days in Paris and then going to another country in the Schengen zone from de 21st to the 26th. (everything is bought since I wanted them to say goodbye before I move definitely to Europe - fiancee is European).</p>  <p>However since few days ago I realized that if I only have the long-stay visa I wont be able to leave France before passing through the OFII process, I plan to apply for a short term visa with another Schengen country (My fiancee will give me an invitation with exact dates, so it will accelerate the approval process). My concern is how should I do with dates. </p>  <ul> <li>What if I asked the short term visa last until the day before the long one starts?. </li> <li>Can they co-exist for some short period (for example if the short one ends after the long one starts working)</li> <li>How will I do with the entry stamp on my passport (if I am in France as tourist and get the entry stamp before my long stay starts working, how can I "activate the long stay one" and then apply for the normal process?)</li> <li>Is there any risk I will somehow be considered in "sejour irreguliere" status or do I risk not having the chance to enter to France?</li> </ul>  <p>According to a <a href="http://diplomatie.gouv.fr/es/IMG/pdf/LS-01d_formulaire_ofii.pdf" rel="nofollow">document published on the web</a>, </p>  <blockquote>   <p>si vous souhaitez vous rendre à l’étranger (dans un pays de la zone Schengen ou effectuer un séjour dans votre pays d’origine), assurez-vous que vous êtes en possession de la vignette OFII apposée sur votre passeport, en regard de votre visa ; dans le cas contraire, vous ne serez pas autorisé à rentrer en France sans avoir au préalable sollicité un visa de retour auprès de l’autorité consulaire compétente".</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, how is the best way to travel before, but having the chance to leave France and then come back?</p> 
11358	Do I need a visa to walk over the Rainbow bridge?	<p>Suppose I'm in Canada visiting the Niagara Falls. Now I want to walk over the Rainbow bridge to visit the American side of the falls.

2177	Can you travel to the US 6 months before your tourist visa expires?	<p>I've heard that you can't travel to the US 6 months before your visa expires.  Is that true?  Or does that only apply to 6 months until the expiration of the passport?  (Or does it apply to neither?)</p> 
11351	Meeting westerners in northern India?	<p>I'm backpacking in northern India in January by myself. How easy will it be to meet other western backpackers and does anyone have any advice on doing so?</p>  <p>I've never been travelling before. I've always heard it's really easy to meet people but I've also heard India is little different as people don't stay in hostels very much.  </p>  <p>I don't suppose it matters that much but I'm 27 and from the UK.</p>  <p>I'm flying into Delhi.

Where is a good place to meet westerners and other backpackers? </p>  <p>I've heard in general travelling is very social and hostels are the best places to meet people. However I've also heard that its harder than most places in India as most people don't stay in hostels. Can anyone give my any advice? I'm 27 and from the UK. Thanks </p> 
69	How bad is baggage theft at Johannesburg airport?	<p>South Africa's Johannesburg's airport has a reputation for stolen and rifled baggage and a quick Google search returns many travelers reporting similar stories.

Has the situation improved in 2011?</p>

2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
4523	Is tourism beneficial to the economies of places affected by natural disasters?	<p>Is tourism to regions that were hit several months ago by natural disasters (for example, the north-eastern part of Honshu, Japan) good for the local economy, and for the people of that area?</p>  <p>Just to clarify, I'd be visiting normal tourist destinations in the region, not visiting specific sites of devastation.</p> 
6955	What are the "rules" for multi-city flights?	<p>As I understand things, airlines generally give discounts for round-trips that consist of a flight from A to B followed by a flight from B to A.  How does this logic work for multi-city flights?  As an example (but don't focus strictly on this example), what about a flight from A to B followed by a flight from C back to A?  What logic is applied to determine whether to charge as separate one-way trips or as a discounted multi-city trip?  Is the important part that the trip begin and end in the same space, or does there need to be an unbroken cycle?</p>  <p>I know I can prod travel search engines for specific examples, but if I understand the rules it can help in my search.  Is this airline dependent?  Does it matter whether the flights are domestic or international (I'm only concerned here about domestic)?</p> 
11125	Are there any tricks to book multi-city international flights?	<p>Generally, multi-city air fares are much higher than round trip fares. Let's say I'm getting these flights (A->B->C->B->A) and I am staying in first B and C. It is actually a round trip with additional stay in first B. How can I get the best deal on this journey?</p> 
5067	Websites to buy complex air tickets	<p>Okay. I'm looking for a complex round ticket.  Like travel from point a - to point B (stay for 2 days)  - then to point C (stay for 2 days) -then to point D  (Destination, stay for 2 weeks) - then return back to point A, but through point E.</p>  <p>To buy a simple round ticket Point A - Point B - Point C - Point D - Point C - Point B - point A costs ~$1500 if I do extended stays price doubles! (Looked at <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com">matrix.itasoftware.com</a>). What are the websites to find cheap airfare with complex routes?</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
10128	Flight with stopover: How to find a similar flight but with 1-week stopover?	<p>Using some website, the cheapest <code>Tokyo→Paris</code> flight has a 5-hours stopover in Dubai.</p>  <p>I would like to make this stopover 7-days, so that I can visit around that place too.</p>  <p>I can't express this requirement on any of the websites I have tried.<br> <code>Tokyo→Dubai</code> + <code>Dubai→Paris</code> is almost twice as expensive.</p>  <p>What is a good way to get this week-long stopover without paying much more?<br> Should I go to an agency? Are there websites that have this feature?</p> 
1209	Which airlines provide free stopovers?	<p>I have heard that British Airways provides free stopover in London i.e. a flight by British Airways via London costs the same as two separate flights from departure city to London and from London to destination city. So does Airfrance with Paris. Also I have recently seen an ad in subway about free stopover in Iceland from Icaelandair. Do you know more elsewhere, especially in Asia?</p> 
10734	Travel by working?	<p>Are there still any ways you can travel by working?</p>  <p>For instance, do you know of any organizations or industries that would be willing to trade either general labor or a specific skill with the benefit of travel? This could be small airlines, traveling circus, cargo ships, pirate ships (kidding), etc.</p>  <p>This could be long-term, short-term, and in mostly any industry.</p> 
1930	Does an EU citizen need a visa to visit Australia for holidays?	<p>Is a visa required, or is just a passport enough, for a short holiday trip to Australia? </p>  <p>Specifically, how is it for citizens of Nordic EU member countries such as Finland? </p> 
543	Is it possible to get from the Philippines to Taiwan to Japan (or the reverse) without flying?	<p>It's not that I have a fear of flying but it seems the best way to see Island countries is by island hopping and these three countries are all relatively close to one another if you take into account their most outlying inhabited islands.</p>  <p>I know there used to be a ferry between Taiwan and Japan that went out of business in 2008. And there seems to be no ferry between the Philippines and Taiwan either.</p>  <p><strong>So how would a true adventurer do it? Can you pay fishing boats or the boats that presumably carry goods between these countries?</strong></p>  <p>I should make it clear that I don't expect to be able to do it on one single boat. One from Philippines to Taiwan and another from Taiwan to Japan would also be good. (More changes would also be good.) I've also included the reverse journey in the question as I'd consider either way to be a great adventure.</p>  <p>Also at which points can I legally enter each country for customs and immigration purposes?</p>  <p>And would it be a lot more difficult to find a boat starting in Japan which I assume to be a much more strictly controlled country?</p>  <p>(Please don't answer "just fly it's easier", such answers will be off topic.)</p> 
11567	How, specifically, can I travel between Taiwan and Okinawa by sea?	<p>This is a followup to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/543/is-it-possible-to-get-from-the-philippines-to-taiwan-to-japan-or-the-reverse-w?rq=1">a previous question of mine where we established that it is possible to travel between the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan</a>.</p>  <p>So now that we know that it's possible, and because this idea keeps coming back to me, I'd like to get some specific answers to how to do the one leg:</p>  <ul> <li>Which shipping companies would take a passenger between Taiwan and Okinawa (or some southerly part of Japan)? And how can I contact them?</li> <li>What range of prices should I expect for the cheapest options in either direction?</li> </ul> 
6304	Why do return flight costs vary depending on the country of origin?	<p>I had planned for my wife, daughters and I to take a holiday from our home in China to the UK for a few weeks in July. Usually, when people visit us in China from the UK, the cost is around £450 to £500 for a return flight. Looking online, I can see that such tickets are available. However, when I looked at the flights from China to the UK the costs for return tickets were in the £850 to £1,000 range.</p>  <p>This seems unfair. Buying the same ticket on the same airplane results in vastly different prices depending on your origin. What justification is there for airlines to charge double the price for return flights from China to the UK and back as for the return flights from UK to China and back?</p>  <p>As it stands this will end our vacation plans as the cost has gone from an expensive £2000 trip for the family to an astronomical £4000 trip, equal to my entire years salary.</p> 
3065	How to fly on the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner?	<p>Sooo, the new <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/25/travel/dreamliner-features/index.html?hpt=hp_bn10">Dreamliner has had its inaugural flight</a>.</p>  <p>The first flight was from <a href="/questions/tagged/tokyo" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'tokyo'" rel="tag">tokyo</a> to <a href="/questions/tagged/hong-kong" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'hong-kong'" rel="tag">hong-kong</a>.</p>  <p>In a bit of competitive fun, a friend and I are trying to beat one another to ride it (he beat me to the A380 - I've still not been on one).</p>  <p>Is there a list of the routes as they open up for it? Not that I'll be able to do it any time soon, but nothing like a bit of forward planning... ;)</p>  <p>EDIT</p>  <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/20/boeing-787-dreamliner-delayed-again-expectations-still-sky-high/">There are about 850 pre-orders</a> for the plane, so with @Roflcopter's 328 below, I'm still missing over 500.  More to be found!</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
3990	What is the best way to get from the airport to center of Buenos Aires?	<p>Is there a good shuttle service? Taxis? What should one expect to pay? Is it worth pre-arranging?</p>

9115	How to get from Buenos Aires to Santiago de Chile by land	<p>I want to get from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Santiago de Chile by land. What is the recommended route and what are the alternatives? Aprox. how much it costs and how long does it takes? Where can I book tickets and find schedules? What are the main problems that can be encountered?</p> 
9176	Preparing home for your trip	<p>I was wondering how I can prepare my rental apartment for a two-week long trip.</p>  <p>It's a rental apartment therefore I don't want to invest in any expensive equipment for surveillance. </p>  <p>I rather would like to know good useful practices as to how to keep my home safe when I am away, and it general what's worth doing when you are planning to be away.</p>  <p>For example, simple thing: defrosting freezer, turning off electricity... such kind of things.</p>  <p>According to security, maybe it's worth taking all your valuable data, equipment, documents to parents or friends, just to avoid loss of valuable things. In my case, it could be a solution, just because I don't have a lot of such things.</p>  <p>Recently I noticed that IP-cameras can be a very useful and cheap solution.</p>  <p>What's your opinion? What do you usually do when you have to leave you home for a long period of time? </p> 
6503	Are there any US laws that a US citizen MUST obey while traveling, even if those laws do not exist in the country he is traveling to?	<p>It goes without saying that the laws vary from country to country, and what is illegal in one country might be both legally permitted and culturally accepted in another.</p>  <p>For example, in the US the minimum age to legally consume alcohol is (generally) 21, <a href="http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/LegalDrinkingAge.html">but in many countries, the minimum age is 18 or lower</a>.  It is possible for a 19-year-old US citizen to travel to Chile, for instance, and consume alcohol legally according to the local laws.</p>  <p>I am curious, though, if a US citizen could potentially* be prosecuted upon returning home for "breaking US laws while on foreign soil".</p>  <p>Is that idea as absurd as it sounds, or are there US laws that US citizens MUST obey while they are traveling, even if no such laws exist (or are less strict) in the countries they are traveling to?</p>  <p>* Leaving aside the practical consideration of how anyone would ever find out what the traveler did during his trip; I'm more curious to know if there's a precedent.</p> 
11047	Can we get a new visa waiver in Canada, for Alaska, when our old one expires in the US?	<p>We are UK citizens driving from Patagonia to Alaska, then shipping home from New York. We hope to be in the US for 3 months, a couple of months in Canada then into Alaska for a couple of  months and then back into Canada and the US. But cannot find information about whether we can get a new visa waiver in Canada for driving to Alaska and then back into the US?</p> 
11323	What questions should I be able to answer when entering USA?	<p>Last time I entered USA, the border officer asked me a lot of questions. Some of them were quite personal and others were about my destination in the USA. For example, he asked me where I would stay. I knew the address and since it was a private host, he asked me if I know the profession of my host. I couldn't answer this question and the border officer seemed a little bit surprised about that.</p>  <p>So my question is: <strong>What questions should I be able to answer when I want to enter the USA?</strong></p> 
16	Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?	<p>My wife and I have decided to move across Europe by train. Do you know of any good sites for planning a trip via train (schedule and maybe prices)? We're going to go across Europe from east (Russia and Baltic countries) to west (France and Germany).<br> I've found only <a href="http://www.oebb.at/">http://www.oebb.at/</a>.</p> 
11618	How to find decent airfares when you need to travel urgently due to personal circumstances and only for a very short time?	<p>Having a global dispersed circle of friend and family, it happened already twice that I needed to travel urgently because of serious personal circumstances. When I had to travel to the deathbed and subsequent funeral of a relative, I even paid twice the price of normal first class ticket for an economy ticket. </p>  <p>When you are confronted with an urgent situation in your family (death or serious illness) how can you find a more economical airfare? I don't mind paying more then normal, but the fares airlines charge you for very short and urgent trips are often outrageous. </p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations?

11648	Is there a list of online public transportation planners?	<p>For Oslo in Norway you can go to <a href="http://ruter.no/en/">ruter.no</a>, punch in where you are and where you want to go. It then gives you options on how to get from point A to point B using various public transportation (and walking).</p>  <p>Is there a list of such services in other countries somewhere? In particular I'm curious to know if there is such a service for London, UK. </p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
7708	Travelling to Brazil without return ticket	<p>Last year I was flying to Brazil with <a href="http://condor.com/">Condor</a>. I don't need a visa, if I stay in Brazil below 90 days (regardless if tourism or business). </p>  <p>The check-in clerk asked me about visa or return ticket. I didn't have return ticket, because at that time I didn't plan my whole trip and have not decided where to go next. I was told, that without a visa or a valid ticket out of Brazil I will not be allowed to check in. <br/> (There was enough time, so I just went and bought cheapest ticket to Montevideo, but that's not important here.)</p>  <p>My question is: <strong>did the person have right to deny checking me in?</strong> Is this anywhere in regulations or law?</p> 
11567	How, specifically, can I travel between Taiwan and Okinawa by sea?	<p>This is a followup to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/543/is-it-possible-to-get-from-the-philippines-to-taiwan-to-japan-or-the-reverse-w?rq=1">a previous question of mine where we established that it is possible to travel between the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan</a>.</p>  <p>So now that we know that it's possible, and because this idea keeps coming back to me, I'd like to get some specific answers to how to do the one leg:</p>  <ul> <li>Which shipping companies would take a passenger between Taiwan and Okinawa (or some southerly part of Japan)?

9426	Does Colombia require proof of onward travel?	<p>I will be flying into Medellín within the next few weeks.  I purchased a one-way ticket, as I will be flying to Asunción after I leave Colombia.</p>  <p>I'm not 100% sure which city I will be flying out of, however, so I haven't purchased my ticket for Paraguay yet.</p>  <p>Will I be required to show proof of onward travel when I arrive in Colombia?</p>  <p>I am a US citizen, if that is important.</p> 
9027	Layover at Narita, Japan. Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes. I am planning to stay within the airport during this period. Does anyone know if I will require a transit visa at Narita?</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
11658	Can the same B1 visa for USA be used after employer has changed?	<p>A colleague was issued a 10-year B1 visa to travel to the US from India while at another company. Can he still use this same visa (within the 10 yrs of issue) for business travel with his current company? Or is a new visa with invitation and business letters from his current company required?</p> 
203	How do you avoid "tourist traps" when traveling to a country where you do not speak the language?	<p>Too many easily accessible restaurants and attractions cater heavily to tourists, and, in doing so, create an environment that they feel will be comfortable to people from other cultures.  </p>  <p>Spending too much time in these locations sometimes leads with only a superficial understanding of the culture.  This is especially difficult when you do not speak the local language.</p>  <p>For travelers who want to learn as much about the authentic culture and day-to-day lives of the people in the areas they are vacationing in, what are some techniques for avoiding the heavily tourist-oriented attractions?  How do you work around the language barrier?  How do you avoid areas that are unsafe?</p> 
8908	How to make the most of my first hostel stay	<p>A number of friends of mine who travel a lot prefer to stay at hostels to save money and make lots of new friends.  It sounds exciting, and I'd like to try it out.</p>  <p>My first stay will be at a hostel in California later this week, and I want to make the most of it.  But I have no idea what to expect.</p>  <p>What should I know/say/do during my visit to make sure that my stay is comfortable, safe and (most importantly!) fun?</p> 
2458	Hostels in US vs. Europe	<p>How do hostels in the US compare with hostels in Europe? Are they similar in terms of convenience, availability, cost, amenities, etc? Or is the "hostel culture" completely different in the two places?</p> 
5243	Communist architecture in Berlin	<p>I am going to be in Berlin for a weekend and would like to photograph and tour some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</a> structures, underground bunkers or any industrial complex. What are my options?</p> 
12899	If I want to make a website of a long bike tour, should I make my own website or pay some one to do it for me?	<p>I am planning on going on a long distance bike tour, and I want to have a good website to blog on, post photos, twitter tweets, and videos. Does anyone have any advice for whether I should build it myself, or pay someone else. Is it worth it or should I just keep a personal journal? I do feel like it would be cool to communicate online, but there are a lot of blogs online about that stuff and it seems pointless to add another.</p> 
9120	La Paz to Santiago by bus	<p>I want to travel from La Paz to Santiago de Chile by bus and was wondering which company to use and how much it would cost. I know its a 24 hour bus ride.</p>

Any body can tell   how much, how long is it and the best services too.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I figured it was worth posting on here, and asking the question.  I'll link to this question in response to his comment.</p> 
1703	Is there any online resource that can tell me what visa rules are for passport holders of a specific country?	<p>When thinking about travelling, I often have to think about a place to visit, and then look up visa rules for that particular country. This can be a fairly painful process because official government sites can often be hard to find, and advice on (say) guidebooks or Wikitravel tends to be generic.</p>  <p>Is there any resource where I can enter my nationality/residency, and then look up a list of visa rules for various countries?</p> 
12967	What is the best way to get ARS using USD?	<p>The current (official) exchange rate for USD to ARS is around 1:5, but I've heard that due to the fluctuation recently there may be a way to get a better value for USD in Argentina.</p>  <p>Any pointers?</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
9245	UK citizen, US company, living in UK: Can I use an ESTA?	<p>So:</p>  <ul> <li>I am a UK citizen</li> <li>I work for a US company</li> <li>I currently live in the UK and have no US visa</li> </ul>  <p>What am I allowed to do when I enter the US on an ESTA? Am I allowed to work if I am getting paid in a UK bank account? Obviously a potentially contentious issue and I'm keen to get it right!</p> 
911	What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?	<p>I've travelled a lot.  Living in New Zealand or the UK means anywhere is likely a flight, but I've always flown economy.  Twice between LA and Auckland I managed to get the exit row after talking nicely to the check-in girl, but apart from that, nothing.  I've spoken to ticket agents, tried 'check in chicken' (where you wait until the last minute before checking in, hoping there's an overbooking of economy) but have never managed to get an upgrade, while others I know seemingly get them quite often.  What strategy have you used or do you suggest to achieve this?</p>  <p>My next flight is from Melbourne to Tokyo, and I plan on trying all of these ;)</p>  <p>(Related questions on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17183/101">car hire</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17026/101">hotel</a> upgrades)</p> 
882	Shipping my car from Europe to Canada or the U.S	<p>The plan is to drive my car (<a href="http://0.tqn.com/d/4wheeldrive/1/0/O/L/1/Alek_Ser_04LadaNiva_2RR.jpg">a small 4x4</a>) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay">Prudhoe Bay</a><sup>1</sup> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhorse,_Alaska">Deadhorse</a>), Alaska to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn">Cape Horn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> in Chile. I will be travelling for an undetermined duration, with a minimum of two years. (I know it can be done a lot faster, but it's about the journey, the destination is just an excuse).</p>  <p>We will leave in the first week of January, 2013. For various reasons, I've decided to bring my own car. So, I'll need to ship it from Europe to Canada.</p>  <p><br/> <strong>My questions are:</strong>  </p>  <ul> <li>Has anybody shipped a car between Europe and Canada or the U.S.?  </li> <li>What kind of cost am I looking at?  </li> <li>Any gotchas I need to know about?</li> </ul>  <p><br/> <strong>Quick Update</strong><br> I'll be shipping from wherever is the cheapest option in Europe (mainland) and shipping to the cheapest option in Canada or the U.S.</p>  <p><br/> <strong>Extra Information</strong><br> Many people suggested buying a car in either Canada or Alaska. But that does not answer the question I was asking : ) The car has some very nice base characteristics (very small, very good off-road ability, cheap) and in addition has special modifications for long range independent travel (such as, but not limited to, extended fuel- and water tanks) and in addition, I know this car's history so I can make an informed estimate about it's reliability. <em>So, I've decided to bring this car</em>. The question is now, what's the best/cheapest option to ship it.</p>  <p>I will likely <em>not</em> re-register the car in the U.S. nor Canada. I've heard from several travellers that it increases hassle if your car is registered in a different country than you live in, so, for now, the plan is to keep the car registered in my home country.</p>  <p><sub><sup>1)</sup> I Actually wanted to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow,_Alaska">Barrow</a>, but it turn out the 200 miles between there and Deadhorse are <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7798/getting-to-barrow-alaska-overland">an expedition in itself</a></sub>.</p> 
8505	Transit between ferries on Tenerife	<p>I'm planning to take a ferry from Gran Canaria to Tenerife and then Tenerife to La Palma on 21 December. The ferry from Gran Canaria arrives at Tenerife 17:00, and the ferry to La Palma departs at 19:00. But: there is 80 km between the ferry terminals. Both ferries are operated by the ferry company Fred. Olsen and they sell the journey as a single entity. Does anyone know, or can anyone infer from <a href="http://www.fredolsen.es" rel="nofollow">their website</a>, whether they offer a transit between the ferries to ensure connection? It's very tight (if at all possible) with regular scheduled buses (based on Google Maps information), so otherwise I'd need to take a taxi.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE 6 October 2012</strong>: In the new timetable, the ferry to La Palma departs at 20:00 rather than 19:00, whereas the ferry from Gran Canaria arrives at the same time. So travellers have three rather than two hours, which makes the usage of <a href="http://www.titsa.com/" rel="nofollow">regular buses</a> much more feasible.</p> 
11648	Is there a list of online public transportation planners?	<p>For Oslo in Norway you can go to <a href="http://ruter.no/en/">ruter.no</a>, punch in where you are and where you want to go. It then gives you options on how to get from point A to point B using various public transportation (and walking).</p>  <p>Is there a list of such services in other countries somewhere? In particular I'm curious to know if there is such a service for London, UK. </p> 
9692	Is it possible to make last-minute reservations on the City Night Train?	<p>I'd like to take the overnight train ("City Night Line") from Germany to France in a few days.  The bahn.de site shows the existence of the train, and gives a price ("from 330 EUR") but says it is too late to book this train, and doesn't give any option to book it.</p>  <p>Is it still possible to book this train in some other way, for example by going to the Deutsche Bahn office at the train station?</p> 
788	How can I travel to Germany with my dog?	<p>I will be traveling to Germany (from the USA) in a few months and hope to bring my dog, a 10 lb Chihuahua-mix.  I would like to do this with a minimum of difficulty, so I am hoping to hear the experiences of others who have done this in order to avoid any pitfalls.</p>  <p>My understanding is that it is necessary to have the dog microchipped and then re-vaccinated against rabies, and have the vet sign a form giving the microchip number and details of the vaccination.  (There is a handy <a href="http://www.zoll.de/english_version/faq/a0_passenger_traffic/d0_pets/index.html">FAQ from the German customs authority</a> which gives the general picture.)</p>  <ul> <li>How long before travel do I need to have the rabies vaccine and microchip done?</li> <li><strong>Is the signature of my vet sufficiently "official"?</strong>  Some other website mentioned getting an approval from the USDA.</li> <li><strong>Is a particular kind of microchip required or recommended?</strong>  I know there are several different microchip systems.</li> <li>Are there any other particular pitfalls to avoid?  For instance, I assume I will have to avoid traveling via Ireland or the UK to get there.</li> </ul> 
11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p> 
1378	Do American cellphones work in Europe?	<p>I have a Virgin Mobile Pay as you go phone, is there any chance that will work in Hungary, Italy and Germany? </p> 
8577	Declaring illegal substances at customs - what would happen?	<p>I've always wondered this.  Occasionally I declare medicines, or wood carvings or whatever when going through customs.  The point of asking you to declare these things is so that they can inspect and prevent say, bug-infested wood from entering New Zealand.</p>  <p>There's usually an amnesty box as well - if you realise at the last minute you have fruit, which you can't bring into New Zealand (just using NZ as an example here), you can dispose of it in their bins, no problem.</p>  <p>Not that I ever would - but hypothetically, if someone came through and for some reason realised they had their illegal drugs stash on them - class A - something really illegal, and they declared it - would customs simply say "thanks for declaring that, we'll have to take that off you as it's illegal in this country" or would they arrest you?</p>  <p>EDIT: For the sake of argument as some countries will probably differ, let's assume the US for the accepted answer.</p> 
10379	Schengen visa refusal	<p>I got a multiple entry Schengen visa from 5-3-2011 to 5-9-2011 (valid for 6 months) last year during which I stayed for 42 days out of the allocated 90 days.</p>  <p>I again applied for a Schengen visa and I got it. I was given a Schengen visa from 17-9-2011 to 31-12-2012 for which I can stay up to 90 days.</p>  <p>I stayed for 82 days of the allocated 90 days for a Schengen visa and went out of the region without any question.</p>  <p>When I again applied for my new Schengen visa I was informed by the embassy that I overstayed during my stay in Schengen territories by 14 days.</p>  <p>The calculation they made was for the last 6 months. I applied on January 4th 2012 and they calculated from that day and informed me that I overstayed by 14 days and they rejected my visa.</p>  <p>In the last page of the passport they put some seal indicating application number for Schengen visa for which it was rejected.</p>  <p>Please let me know whether I will get a Schengen visa in the future as I am very much stressed about this. Also I have only a few pages left in the passport now. If I change my passport will it solve my problem?</p> 
13164	How early do you need to get to the station for a Eurostar service?	<p>Do you have to be at the station a certain time in advance for Eurostar services? Or can you just rock up a few minutes before and jump on, much as you might do with many other European high speed trains?</p> 
10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
435	Should I purchase rental car insurance? What protection does my credit card provide?	<p>We just arrived in Hawaii this afternoon, and when I went to pick up the rental car, I discovered I hadn't done my homework with regard to the insurance options.</p>  <p>I recall that my credit card will provide some level of insurance when I use it to rent a car, but when I mentioned it to the Customer Services Representative, he informed me that my credit card only covers collision, and he suggested I purchase liability insurance from the rental agency.</p>  <p>For the future, what information do I need to collect in order to make an informed decision about what insurance policies I should (or should not) purchase when I rent a car?</p> 
2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
780	Buying Paris metro tickets from Eurostar before/during the journey?	<p>Whenever a Eurostar gets into Brussels, and especially when one gets into Paris, there is always a mad scramble for the metro ticket machines, and if you weren't in the first coach then a very long queue...</p>  <p>A couple of years ago I did manage to buy Paris metro tickets from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostar">Eurostar</a> information desk in London before I left, as described <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm">here</a>. (It was at the information desk on the far right after security and passport checks). I seem to recall they even sold me the tickets in sterling at the day's exchange rate!</p>  <p>I've subsequently recommended this to a friend, who wasn't able to buy the tickets from the information desk, and instead had the long queue at the metro ticket machines on arrival.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if Eurostar are still normally selling metro tickets from the information counter? And/or does the buffet on board sell them? (I think I've once heard an announcement about that)</p> 
10883	Skipping long lines at free-museum days in Paris	<p>In Paris, many museums are free on the first Sunday of each month. Thus the lines for museum entry can be extremely long. Is it possible to skip through the line if I bought a ticket in advance?</p>  <p>I ask because the security line to enter the Louvre is usually quite long and visitors who pre-purchased tickets can skip to the front of the security line, so I'm wondering if this applies on free-entry days (as it can be worth my money to save time in the line).</p> 
10390	I am looking for a hotel search engine for rural areas	<p>I am trying to find a bucolic holiday destination, which means finding a nice hotel in a small beautiful village for spending some quiet time.  Most search engines are only finding major cities, and famous tourist-oriented places; for me one main factor is that it is not too far from the airport, and in my case I would like to find somewhere in southern Europe.</p>  <p><strong>I am looking for a hotel search engine for rural areas.</strong>   </p> 
1167	Paris on a Tuesday - are the Louvre and the Pompidou Centre the only "big" attractions that are closed?	<p>One that's caught me out before is that the Louvre is <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/horaires.jsp?bmLocale=en" rel="nofollow">closed on Tuesdays</a>. It looks like the Centre Pompidou is also <a href="http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Communication.nsf/0/4FEAC046A4F24A42C1257570003D87FE?OpenDocument&amp;L=1" rel="nofollow">closed Tuesdays</a> (French - Tuesday=Mardi).</p>  <p>However, the Paris Modern Art Museum (Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris) is <a href="http://mam.paris.fr/" rel="nofollow">closed Mondays</a>, and the Eiffel Tower is open <a href="http://www.eiffel-tower.com/preparing-your-visit/opening-times" rel="nofollow">every day</a>, so it's not a universal thing.</p>  <p>Without wishing to build a list of the closing days of all of Paris's attractions, are there any other "big name" attractions that are also closed on a Tuesday, or are those the only two big ones to catch the unwary visitor out?</p> 
5317	Day trips from London?	<p>Very soon, I'll spend some time in London. The weather forecast isn't that great and I think I have to expect some rainy days. Sightseeing in wet clothes is okay for some days, but not everyday. So I'm looking for some day-trips to interesting places which are suitable for bad weather. Any recommendations?</p>  <p>I'm interested in a lot of different things, but I'd particularly like to see things that I can't see anywhere else. Additionally, I like natural sights, landmarks and architectural sights as well as places that have a historical meaning.</p> 
13233	Are there days/times/dates when most Paris museums are free?	<p>While Paris does have some great free museums and art galleries, such as <a href="http://www.petitpalais.paris.fr/">Le Petit Palais</a> and  <a href="http://www.mam.paris.fr/en">Musée d'Art Moderne de la ville de Paris</a> many of the museums have an entrance fee. Since most of my museum going "at home" is in Oxford or London, where the bulk of the museums are free, it's a little shock to be asked for €10-€15 to see the permanent collection.</p>  <p>To help avoid this, are there any special days / times / dates when many of the Parisian museums and galleries are open for free, instead of their usual entrance fees?</p> 
13231	Is there a Paris equivalent of London's Oyster Pay-As-You-Go?	<p>When travelling around London, I usually follow the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2041/london-on-public-transport-what-kind-of-tickets-to-use">standing advice</a> and use an Oyster pay-as-you-go card for my tube/bus/train/dlr journeys. It works well, as I can load some cash on every so often, quickly breeze through turnstiles / onto buses, and I know that after a few journeys in a day my costs will be capped and all subsequent journeys will be effectively "free".</p>  <p>Historically, when in Paris, I've tended to just buy a carnet of 10 metro/bus tickets, often from the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/780/buying-paris-metro-tickets-from-eurostar-before-during-the-journey">shop on-board the Eurostar</a> on the way. However, I've noticed recently that almost everyone else is using Navigo cards for their travel, rather than the paper metro tickets. Is it possible to get an equivalent to an Oyster pay-as-you-go for Paris as an occasional tourist? (Let's say 2-5 journeys in a typical day)</p> 
8583	Least stressful method of travelling around Paris	<p>In London I can get one day travel card for the underground train,  - it might not always be the absolute cheapest but I nearly always end up getting one. And if I were a tourist I would definitely get one as they are flexible, cheap and simple. </p>  <p>I am taking my parents in-law (lucky me) to Paris and they are old so I want to avoid all possible stresses such as queuing and not knowing what ticket to get. Is there an equivalent to the one day travel card in Paris, even one I could purchase before hand ?  We are staying 2 nights. </p>  <p>Also, any recommended itineraries for 5 people, 2 of which are 65+ and never really been abroad before ? Notre Dame, Eiffel tower, walking along the river are all on the list any other recommendations ?  Is their an equivalent to a red London bus tour ?</p> 
525	What class of travel is suitable for a woman travelling alone on Indian railways?	<p>What class should a lone woman travel on a sleeper train to be safe at night?</p> 
5575	Travel health insurance in Europe that does not require European Health Insurance Card	<p>I was looking for a new travel insurance policy recently for travel within Europe and what I was never aware of is that <a href="http://www.moneysupermarket.com/travel-insurance/ehic/" rel="nofollow">many insurance policies require you to have an European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for the cover to be valid</a>. I have looked at quite a few policies and this does appear to be the case. Two questions:</p>  <ul> <li>Is is <strong>mandatory</strong> to carry an EHIC to be admitted to a hospital? The wording in policies seems to be confusing as they say excess will be waived in case an EHIC is used. But if I'm willing to pay the excess amount, am I still covered otherwise?</li> <li>Are there travel insurance policies that do NOT require an EHIC to be carried for the policy to be valid?  </li> </ul>  <p>(Yes I know an EHIC is free to apply for but I wanted to get a travel insurance that would work without it, just in case I am not carrying / don't have an EHIC on me.)</p> 
9245	UK citizen, US company, living in UK: Can I use an ESTA?	<p>So:</p>  <ul> <li>I am a UK citizen</li> <li>I work for a US company</li> <li>I currently live in the UK and have no US visa</li> </ul>  <p>What am I allowed to do when I enter the US on an ESTA? Am I allowed to work if I am getting paid in a UK bank account? Obviously a potentially contentious issue and I'm keen to get it right!</p> 
3104	Vomitorium: Only common in the German-speaking world?	<p>The first time I saw something like this in a Swiss Restaurant in Zurich I was really confused. What should it be used for?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UzNme.jpg" alt="Speibecken"></p>  <p>(photo <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei%3aSpeibecken.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060425065336">by TheoPB</a>, available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-by-sa</a>) </p>  <p>Then I was told that you can find those sanitary installations particularly in traditional restaurants that are frequently visited by students and they use it if they drank too much beer.</p>  <p>In my various travels through Europe and North America I haven't seen anything like this. So I'm really wondering if I can tell my fellow travelers that I meet if this is a Swiss/German invention? Maybe because of the lively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentenverbindung">Studentenverbindungen</a> in Switzerland?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
638	If I travel to Paris, can I get by with just English?	<p>If I plan on visiting Paris, but not really the rest of France, is it still important for me to learn at least enough French to get by? Are people in Paris going to be willing to speak English if they know it, or is it more like they want to see you at least trying?</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
10600	Best deals for students booking international flight tickets from India	<p>I will be travelling to and fro from Hyderabad (HYD), India to Berlin (TXL), Germany.

6592	What to do if I lost my passport before flight in another country?	<p>I'm just asking this question for my info. I will be traveling from India to Amsterdam on a short trip.</p>  <p>What should you do if you lose your passport or the passport gets stolen (especially in a Schengen country)?</p>  <p>As I read on the Internet that if someone loses his passport, the following things have to be done:</p>  <ul> <li>Contact the airline immediately and change the flight date to at least 2 months ahead because it will take at least 2 months to get a new passport.</li> <li>Contact the nearest police station and file the report of lost passport</li> <li>Go to the embassy of your country to apply for a new passport. This will take 2 months after applying</li> </ul>  <p>Until you get the new passport you will have to stay in town for approximately 2 months. So you should have extra money for that.</p>  <p>Is the above information correct? Please reply if you have a more detailed and more accurate answer.</p> 
5149	What is the LONGEST Tour operated by travel companies?	<p>I remember 6 years ago, discovering "The Great South American Journey" operated by Gap adventures (now G Adventures), a 5 month trip around the continent (although essentially a bunch of their smaller tours joined together).</p>  <p>Then this year, I found <a href="http://www.africantrails.co.uk/tour/ultimate-trans-africa-uk-to-turkey">this</a>: a <strong>43 week</strong> tour of Africa, covering something like <strong>28 countries</strong> in that time.</p>  <p>I was wondering - two parts, what's the longest official tour offered in the world in terms of time travelling, and which official tour covers the most number of countries?</p> 
8768	Consequences of overstaying Schengen visa in Switzerland	<p>I overstayed my Schengen visa by 2 weeks when I traveled to Switzerland. The police in Switzerland gave me a paper saying that I will receive a penalty order in one or two months requiring me to pay a fine and that I may also be issued a prohibition of entry forbidding me from entering Switzerland and the Schengen states for a period of one or more years.</p>  <p>I am holding a Vietnamese Passport. This occurred today, and I am worrying about what will happen to me.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how much is the fine for overstaying a Schengen visa?  Will I not be allowed to enter the Schengen states?</p> 
1064	Is it possible for a tourist to visit South Ossetia?	<p>South Ossetia is a rebel provice of the Republic of Georgia recognized and supported by Russia as an independent state since 2008 but recognized by most countries in the world as part of the Republic of Georgia.</p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1063/can-i-visit-abkhazia-from-the-republic-of-georgia">Last I heard the situation was a bit different to that in Abkhazia which I believe can be visited somehow.</a></p>  <p>I heard that in the case of South Ossetia you cannot visit from Russia (North Ossetia) unless you are a citizen of a CIS country, and that you cannot visit from Georgia at all.</p>  <p>Is this still the case in November 2011? Can I visit as foreign tourist either from Georgia or Russia and if so what visas/permits/paperwork will I need? If I can visit from Russia but not from Georgia will I have trouble subsequently visiting Georgia with a South Ossetia passport stamp?</p>  <p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>  <p>I'm not asking about whether any western country issues travel advisories asking me not to visit. I'm aware it's unstable to some degree or other. If there are documented killings or kidnappings of western tourists in the last year that may be relevant however.</p> 
10077	Can you currently get from Turkey to Egypt by ferry?	<p>Since April 2012, <a href="http://www.anrusstrans.ru/" rel="nofollow">Anrusstrans</a> is offering a ferry service between the Turkish port of Mersin, in the south east of the country, and Port Said, east of Alexandria on the Egyptian coast. Over at horizonsunlimited, for example <a href="http://www.horizonsunlimited.com/hubb/sahara-travel-forum/ferry-boat-between-egypt-turkey-63954" rel="nofollow">here</a>, there is some chatter about the journey, as well as some personal accounts. However, the personal accounts differ significantly in the details and are very anecdotal.</p>  <p>So far, Anrusstrans has not responded to my emails, requesting information, nor has a handler in Mersin.</p>  <p>Who has the lowdown on this? How often and on what days does the ferry leave Mersin? How much does it cost for a foot passenger? Interesting to others, how much does it cost to transport a motor bike? A car?</p> 
13437	How can I cross the Atlantic by ship from Europe to New York?

1860	What is the state of train travel in USA?	<p>I'm planning to go to the USA for some months. I'd like to travel there by train, but I heard that trains aren't really widely used in USA. So my questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>How is the rail network in the USA? Is it possible to reach the big cities and also some smaller sights in a feasible amount of time?</li> <li>Is there a train ticket that allows an unlimited use of all trains?</li> </ul> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
248	Avoiding air travel sickness without Dramamine/Dimenhydrinate or other drugs	<p>My wife is very prone to motion sickness, especially on air flights.  In the past we've handled this with Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate), which helped quite a bit.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, my wife's reaction to the Dramamine was invariably to fall into a deep, groggy sleep for the duration of the flight.  This is her reaction to most antihistamines. </p>  <p>We're planning on taking a trip to Europe next year, and I'm concerned about the idea of essentially drugging her into unconsciousness for the duration of an extended overseas flight.</p>  <p>Is there any other recourse to prevent motion sickness that would be effective for a long haul (7+ hours) flight?</p> 
7733	How to assess whether a restaurant is good on the spot?	<p>You just arrived hungry in a new city and are in a desperate need of finding a good place to eat. And you need to do it without a guidebook or recommendation. There is one restaurant popping after another and many others hidden around or in other districts. You can give out very little for a marvelous dinner, or spend 20 € for dry chips, burnt chicken and rude staff (as I did in Paris). So the decision is very important, especially if you want to taste local dishes.</p>  <p>So what techniques one can use to assess a good restaurant on the spot?</p> 
12847	How do I become a better tourist guide for my own city or country?	<p>I'm planning a trip to Melbourne, which is only a short plane trip away from Sydney, and currently I'm planning on using the same information sources to plan my trip that I'd use for anywhere else in the world (Lonely Planet, Trip Advisor, WikiVoyage).</p>  <p>There's the possibility that I'll be sightseeing with someone visiting Australia for the first time.</p>  <p>I'll have a slight advantage in that I've been there before, so I can give my opinion on certain attractions, but apart from that, I won't be able to give the overseas tourist any "local knowledge".</p>  <p>The situation wouldn't be much better if someone were visiting Sydney (where I live), either. I'd be able to tell them about Sydney's transit system, and what time things close, and what suburbs are a bit dodgy. But in terms of places to visit, I'd only be able to list places that are fairly well known.</p>  <p>Is my lack of "local knowledge" unusual? What can I do to improve my local knowledge?</p>  <p>Related question: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/203/324">How do you avoid &quot;tourist traps&quot; when traveling to a country where you do not speak the language?</a> , except that I'm supposed to be the "local knowledge" to avoid such "tourist traps"!</p> 
1538	Flying UK to Canada via USA. Do I need to apply for ESTA?	<p>I'm going to fly from the UK to Canada via EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport). Do I need to apply for a Visa Waiver through the ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization)?</p> 
16	Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?	<p>My wife and I have decided to move across Europe by train. Do you know of any good sites for planning a trip via train (schedule and maybe prices)? We're going to go across Europe from east (Russia and Baltic countries) to west (France and Germany).<br> I've found only <a href="http://www.oebb.at/">http://www.oebb.at/</a>.</p> 
12942	Is weed still legal for tourists in Amsterdam?	<p>I have heard it's not legal starting from 2013. I also heard they postponed applying this? So what's the deal? Allowed or not?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
2615	Where can I find and book plane tickets on date not on destination?	<p>I have a holiday coming up and I would like to travel with the family somewhere. I have specific wishes regarding departure and arrival times, but the destination is less relevant. Where can I search on date and departure/arrival times for possible destinations?</p> 
13360	Finding all flights from an airport to a country	<p>Is there a place to find all (or nearly all) flights going from a certain airport during a certain time period?</p>  <p>If the "departure announcement board" at the airport was much longer (covering months rather than hours), that would work as an answer for me.</p> 
8642	Can I buy a prepaid mobile data plan while on route in France?	<p>I will be driving through France soon and would like to have a local prepaid sim with data capabilities. I found a very interesting sollution in the <a href="http://frenchconnection.fr/02_how.aspx">French Connection</a>, but I need a French delivery address. I don't have that on such a short notice, so I am looking for a plan that I could buy while on route (gas station, shopping malls, etc)</p> 
6583	Any special way to mark penicillin allergy on my passport?	<p>I'm allergic to penicillin, the antibiotic. I just got a new (European) passport. Is there some 'best practices'/common way to mark this allergy on my passport? I filled in the emergency contact &amp; blood group details, so I wonder if I should put penicillin allergy down? Is there any commonly understood code/symbol/wording? Or should I just write "PENICILLIN ALLERGY" (and whatever that is in French) on the same page as the blood group details?</p> 
13004	What size can my checked luggage be on Kuwait Airways?	<p>It says on Kuwait Airways website that 3 dimensions shall not exceed 158 cm. Does this mean the length, width and depth can be any size, just that they need to all add up to 158cm?</p>  <p>I have never been abroad so I'm new to this.</p> 
7539	Is a 1 hour layover in Amsterdam sufficient?	<p>I found a great price to Geneva (to visit a friend), however the itinerary I found calls for a 1 hour layover (only) in Amsterdam. 5:55am-6:55am. What is the likelihood of missing the connecting flight, since we have to go through customs and whatnot?</p>  <p>I fly abroad pretty frequently, so I know this is an extremely thin margin. I wonder if anyone knows about the speed and efficiency of Amsterdam, or what it will be like that time of day.</p>  <p>EDIT: I want to note the flight is incoming from the USA, not anywhere in the Schengen zone.</p> 
8583	Least stressful method of travelling around Paris	<p>In London I can get one day travel card for the underground train,  - it might not always be the absolute cheapest but I nearly always end up getting one. And if I were a tourist I would definitely get one as they are flexible, cheap and simple. </p>  <p>I am taking my parents in-law (lucky me) to Paris and they are old so I want to avoid all possible stresses such as queuing and not knowing what ticket to get. Is there an equivalent to the one day travel card in Paris, even one I could purchase before hand ?  We are staying 2 nights. </p>  <p>Also, any recommended itineraries for 5 people, 2 of which are 65+ and never really been abroad before ? Notre Dame, Eiffel tower, walking along the river are all on the list any other recommendations ?  Is their an equivalent to a red London bus tour ?</p> 
13231	Is there a Paris equivalent of London's Oyster Pay-As-You-Go?	<p>When travelling around London, I usually follow the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2041/london-on-public-transport-what-kind-of-tickets-to-use">standing advice</a> and use an Oyster pay-as-you-go card for my tube/bus/train/dlr journeys. It works well, as I can load some cash on every so often, quickly breeze through turnstiles / onto buses, and I know that after a few journeys in a day my costs will be capped and all subsequent journeys will be effectively "free".</p>  <p>Historically, when in Paris, I've tended to just buy a carnet of 10 metro/bus tickets, often from the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/780/buying-paris-metro-tickets-from-eurostar-before-during-the-journey">shop on-board the Eurostar</a> on the way. However, I've noticed recently that almost everyone else is using Navigo cards for their travel, rather than the paper metro tickets. Is it possible to get an equivalent to an Oyster pay-as-you-go for Paris as an occasional tourist? (Let's say 2-5 journeys in a typical day)</p> 
13267	First time in Paris - decent questions regarding transportation and tourist attractions	<p><strong>About my journey:</strong></p>  <p>I will be travelling to Paris in the beginning of March with my girlfriend and staying for 3 days. </p>  <p>We are landing at <em>Paris Beauvais Tille Airport</em>. I have unfortunately found that the airport is kinda far away from the city, but understood from their website that there are a lot of methods to get between the airport and <em>Porte Maillot</em>.</p>  <p>We will be staying at a hotel near <em>Parc Suzanne Lenglen</em> (Bd. Gambetta).</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>  <ol> <li><strong>Travelling</strong> : Hope that I am not wrong, but I was considering travelling through town by Metro (from downtown to the hotel, from a tourist attraction to another, etc). I searched for ticket prices on their website and found that 10 tickets are €12.70. Are the tickets available on any Metro line? (I will need to switch metros every now and then). Do you suggest buying a 3 day pass? Or better individual tickets?</li> <li><strong>Must see tourist attractions</strong> : I've seen where <em>La tour Eiffel</em>, <em>La Louvre</em> or <em>La cathédrale Notre-Dame</em> are situated. I would like to know what other must-see places you suggest (preferably somewhere downtown, but this is not a must as long as there is a metro station nearby). Any suggestion is welcomed - from museums to nice parks or picturesque buildings, monuments, etc.</li> <li><strong>Travelling between tourist attractions</strong> : Do you recommend walking every now and then between the tourist attractions? For example I saw there are 3.5 km between <em>La Tour Eiffel</em> and <em>La Louvre</em>. Is it worthwhile walking this distance? Meaning that if it is a nice area to travel by foot.</li> <li><strong>Admission fees for the attractions</strong> : I saw for example on the <em>Louvre</em>'s website that <code>Admission to the Louvre and the Musée Eugène Delacroix is free for the following visitor categories: 18-25 year-old residents of the European Economic Area (EU, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein)</code>. Can anyone confirm? Are there any other discounts for students? Do they apply if I am a student in my own country and provide proper documents? I hope we will not be spending too much on entrance fees where we go.</li> </ol>  <p>Any other comments, proposals and any kind of feedback is more than welcomed. If anything else pops up in my mind I will put it here.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance !</p> 
13516	Does my government know in which country I am at when I travel?	<p>I guess this is the type of question I should start with "a friend of mine wants to know..." but I was wondering if in general governments keep a record which gets updated each time you go through inmigration in another country in some sort of centralized database, or they have to check your passport stamps to check were have you been in between your departure and arrival.</p>  <p>I guess each country must have their own rules, but I am asking in a general sense.</p> 
763	How to see the Norwegian fjords?	<p>I am currently working in The Hague area of the Netherlands. This summer is too cold to spend weekends on the beach, so I've decided to spend 3-4 days seeing the Norwegian fjords instead. </p>  <p>I understand there are three possibilities:</p>  <ol> <li>Find a ship starting from Amsterdam that goes to the fjords and back.</li> <li>Go to one of the fjords and rent a house for 2-3 days.</li> <li>Go to Oslo or another Norwegian city, stay there, and take a bus trip to the fjords.</li> </ol>  <p>Which is the cheapest, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?</p>  <p>As for now - the most desired for me is 2. I checked the prices for flights - and Oslo is 3 times cheaper from Amsterdam then Trondheim. Do you know if there is a possibility to rent a house on the fjord close to Oslo?</p> 
2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>". In one <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa/1214#1214">answer</a> it is said that "international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible". The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p> 
11572	Can I connect through the USA with liquid duty-free purchases?	<p>In the near future I'll be travelling DUB-ORD-PDX and I was wondering if I can make liquid duty-free purchases in Dublin and bring them through security as carry-on luggage in Chicago O'Hare.</p>  <p>I will be changing terminal in O'Hare (T5 -> T1), so I have to re-clear security. In some EU airports the security people treat sealed, clear duty-free bags as "safe" for the purposes of the liquids ban. Do they do likewise in Chicago?</p>  <p>I won't have the opportunity to re-pack anything I buy and put it in my hold baggage since that will be checked through (I clear US customs in Dublin).</p> 
5018	Comparing travel costs in Europe: rail vs bus	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8jiXv.png" alt="Busabout Long Way Round tour"></p>  <p>I wanted to compare costs for travelling around in Europe by bus and rail. While I don't have a firm itinerary yet, for the purposes of this comparison let's assume that it will be close to the route shown in the map above.</p>  <p>I took this route map from <a href="http://www.busabout.com/hop-on-hop-off/long-way-round">Busabout's 'Long Way Round' itinerary page</a>. Busabout's bus tours definitely seems expensive to me. What if I did this same / similar route on <a href="http://www.eurolines.com">Eurolines</a>' network instead, using a Eurolines pass? Will that be any cheaper than using an Interrail Global Pass instead?</p> 
8125	How rigorous are Amtrak in enforcing luggage rules?	<p>Looking at Amtrak trains between NY and Boston, I found that all had "no checked luggage" save for a midnight train (less than ideal for a relaxing vacation).</p>  <p>Looking at <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/Satellite?SnippetName=IBLegacy&amp;pagename=am/AM_Snippet_C/SnippetWrapper&amp;ibsref=NoCheckedBaggage">this reference</a>, it's not really that restrictive as you can take bags on to the train.  My question is on the size restrictions of 28" x 22" x 14" (70cm x 55cm x 35cm in my parlance).  We'll be travelling with a backpack taller than this, albeit not much (maybe four to eight inches/10 to 20 cms), so I was wondering how much effort Amtrak puts into enforcing this?  Has anyone else travelled with an oversized baggage as "carry on"?</p> 
10615	How difficult is train travel in Italy?	<p>We will be in Italy (for the first time) this week!  :-)</p>  <p>Our itinerary is:</p>  <pre><code>17th - 20th Venice 20th - 22nd Florence 22nd - 22nd Pisa (quick view of the Leaning Tower) 22nd - 26th Rome </code></pre>  <p>So as you can see, the <code>22nd</code> is going to be a busy day.  Last time I was in Europe (2000), I had booked train travel from Paris to Brussels but I believe I did it online.</p>  <p>So my question is this.  Do I have to book these reservations in advanced or can we just go up to the train stations and get tickets for the same day?  We will be two adults and one child.  We would prefer high-speed if available.</p>  <p>So it looks like we would be buying tickets on the 20th and 22nd.  But on the 22nd, we would be buying tickets twice.</p> 
1836	Is there any way of evaluating the quality of a hotel's internet connection in advance?	<p>I'm on the road a lot for work. I tend to end up staying at a lot of budget chain hotels that offer free wi-fi. So far so good. But sadly, not all wi-fi is created equal. The past few weeks I've been subjected to a particularly shameful string of <em>terrible</em> connections, and I've decided to try to take matters into my own hands and research the speed/quality of a given hotels connection ahead of time...</p>  <p>... only to find that there is absolutely nowhere on the internet that this is discussed at all. I would think that, by now, some enterprising traveller would have created a listing of some sort, which, even if not comprehensive, could be a start. But I'm coming up completely cold.</p>  <p>And so I turn to you Travel.SE: Does this exist? If not, do I have any other options for researching the quality of any given hotels internet other than trying to skim 200 tripadvisor reviews, most of which are probably faked? </p> 
711	What are the main differences in traffic regulations between the US/Europe?	<p>There are the obvious ones. The US has the keep-your-lane system, where as in Europe you are expected to keep to the right (left for UK) as long as possible.  On my latest travel to the US, I was confronted with the possibility to go through a red light if you turn right, unless it is explicitly not allowed.  So my question is, what a european driver should know when driving in the US. What are the do's and don'ts compared to driving in Europe. </p> 
823	Which chateaux of the Loire are worth visiting?	<p>When visiting France, one of the great things to see are the Chateaux of the Loire Valley. An hour by TGV from Paris, yet a world apart, with stunning grand palatial castles in beautiful scenery, it's certainly somewhere to visit.</p>  <p>If you check most guidebooks, they all seem to agree on two Chateaux to visit. Firstly there's the Château de Chambord, an impressive Renaissance masterpiece that's the largest of the Loire Chateau.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QNc9P.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:France_Loir-et-Cher_Chambord_Chateau_03.jpg"></p>  <p>The other that everyone seems to agree on is the Château de Chenonceau. While smaller, the rooms, tapestries, furniture and artworks are stunning, and you visit as much for the contents as the building itself. There are some very nice gardens too.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nky8B.jpg" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chateau_de_Chenonceau_2008E.jpg"></p>  <p>Having visited these two last year (along with a couple of others), I'm keen to see a few more this year. The problem is that most guidebooks either seem to stop after just a few, or go on to list several hundred, without the middle ground.</p>  <p>My question therefore is what other Chateaux of the mid Loire (roughly Angers to Tours)  should one try to see (beyond the obvious two of Chenonceau and Chambord), and why?</p> 
920	Are there any issues with using credit cards in Germany?	<p>On my last trip to Germany my credit cards (chip-based Visa and MasterCard) were declined more than usual. I've been there like 10 times and haven't noticed this before but on this trip train ticket machines refused to service them, small shops didn't accept them and even a huge consumer electronics network store Mediamarkt said "EC cards only". (Whatever "EC card" is)</p>  <p>Has anything changed in regard to credit cards in Germany in recent years or was I just unlucky this time? And what's the root of this problem? As far as I understand these chip-based credit cards technically are not that different (if at all) from debit/atm cards.</p> 
7968	Can US cards be used in countries with chip-and-pin systems?	<p>I'll be visiting the UK in a few weeks, and I understand that the UK credit/debit card system works on a "chip-and-pin" system. As far as I can ascertain via Google, US cards don't have this system on them. I've also read on some websites that certain readers will not process cards without the chip-and-pin, but I'm not sure how widespread such readers are. </p>  <p>With that in mind, is it likely that my US-issued card  will be generally usable in the UK and other countries with the chip-and-pin system, or should I be ready to exchange cash? In addition, does credit/debit make a difference in this regard?</p> 
6021	Correct reasons for opting out of millimetre wave scanners	<p>Having travelled through SFO a few times, and each time been asked to go through a millimetre wave (or backscatter) scanner, and each time 'opted out' and gone for the search (in public), I'd like to know what is the proper reasons to give when they ask why I've opted out.</p>  <p>I tried the <strong>radiation</strong> argument the first time, just after they were introduced, but this argument doesn't seem to be too valid now since the millimetre wave scanners aren't very powerful.</p>  <p>I've tried <strong>privacy</strong> but not really known what to say afterwards other than the technical issues of caching, wiping images, etc.</p>  <p>Each one got some snarky comments from the security staff, and discussion from the one given the opportunity to feel me up, so I'd like to arm myself with a bit more information/argumentation for next time.</p> 
861	Denmark and Schengen - border controls	<p>As I know, Denmark is going to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13366047" rel="nofollow">re-impose the border controls</a>. I want to know, what exactly it means for the tourists who are on a Schengen visa? Can I visit Denmark with the Schengen visa, or I need some additional documents?  I'm a Russian citizen.</p> 
5538	Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?	<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>  <p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p> 
13901	What do I need to work and travel in the US for 10 months as a Dutch citizen?	<p>I am a Dutch citizen planning on going on a big trip to the USA from January 2014 to October 2014. I want to visit Canada and Honduras as well during this trip, but these will be short vacation like trips. My focus will be on the USA.</p>  <p>The basic plan is to travel across the US, work in a restaurant/bar/any place that hires me or do an internship at a company for a couple of months (graduated aerospace engineer by then), and then travel some more. <a href="http://www.wwoofusa.org">WWOOF</a>'ing for a while is also part of the plan.<br> I do not plan on immigrating to the USA, so it's going to be a long temporal stay.</p>  <p>My question is now: if this type of journey is possible, what documents do I need?</p> 
835	Extended stay visa for Germany	<p>I want to apply for an extended stay visa for Germany to visit a friend.  I want to visit beyond the 90 days that American can visit Schengen countries without going through an application process.  The German embassy website indicates that I need to fill out an on-line visa application form.  The form asks for the length of stay but indicates that a number greater than 90 days can't be entered.  I'm also asked to provide a copy of a plane reservation but I don't want to buy a plane ticket without knowing if I can stay longer than 90 days.  </p>  <p>Does anyone have pointers for navigating the process?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  After some digging around I found from the <a href="http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/05__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Permanent__Residence__Visa.html">German Embassy Website</a> that anyone who wishes to stay in Germany more than 90 days must obtain a residence permit.  This information was hard to find because it is only stated in the section that deals with permanent residence.  From the website:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Citizens of the United States of America, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, as well as EU citizens may apply for their residence permit after entering Germany without a visa.</p> </blockquote> 
13715	Re-enter USA from Canada with Visa Waiver Program	<p>My wife and I are doing a North America trip this summer.</p>  <p>We fly to NYC, stay a couple of days, then fly to Vancouver, spend two weeks in British Columbia and then back home (Germany).</p>  <p>We thought about travelling to Seattle a few days with our rental car, when we are in BC.</p>  <p>My question is, if there is any issue, when we reenter USA from Canada after leaving NYC a couple of days earlier? We both use Visa Waiver Program (German citizen).</p> 
10737	Is it safe to attend a soccer game between Croatia and Serbia as a tourist?	<p>In the beginning of next year, Croatia will play against Serbia in the qualification round for the soccer world championship 2014 in Brasilia. The game will take place at 22.03.2013 in Zagreb and since I'm in the city for sightseeing around this date, I was thinking about attending this soccer match.</p>  <p>However, I'm not really sure if this is a good idea. Soccer games between Serbia and Croatia have a history of violence and racism. In the last days, the relationship between these two countries got even worse because <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/16/us-warcrimes-gotovina-acquittal-idUSBRE8AF0N020121116" rel="nofollow">the two Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac were found not guilty for their suspected war crimes during the war in the Balkans</a>.</p>  <p>Considering the difficult relations between these two countries, I'm asking myself if it is relatively safe to attend a soccer game as a tourist? By safe I mean if there is any realistic danger that I will get into situations concerning violence, crime or racism?</p> 
5317	Day trips from London?	<p>Very soon, I'll spend some time in London. The weather forecast isn't that great and I think I have to expect some rainy days. Sightseeing in wet clothes is okay for some days, but not everyday. So I'm looking for some day-trips to interesting places which are suitable for bad weather. Any recommendations?</p>  <p>I'm interested in a lot of different things, but I'd particularly like to see things that I can't see anywhere else. Additionally, I like natural sights, landmarks and architectural sights as well as places that have a historical meaning.</p> 
9619	Sail & Rail to from Ireland to the Isle of Man	<p>I've often used Sail&amp;Rail tickets to travel between Ireland and the UK. Seat61 tells me that Sail&amp;Rail is also available <a href="http://seat61.com/Isle-of-Man.htm">from the UK to the Isle of Man</a>. However, I cannot find out whether I can use Sail&amp;Rail between Ireland and the Isle of Man. (Tickets from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland would do.)</p>  <p>The Seat61 site has an embedded booking form from <a href="http://new.raileasy.co.uk/">Rail Easy</a>, but that just says "No journey found".</p> 
13816	Camping stove on a plane?	<p>Can I bring a camping stove (without fuel) on a (domestic or international) jet, either in checked baggage, carry-on, or some other means?</p> 
14016	How to buy duty free other than at the airport?	<p>Everybody knows you can buy things duty free at airports if you are leaving for or coming from another country.</p>  <p>(You can also buy on airplanes and I think I've seen on some international ferries and some land border crossings.)</p>  <p>But rent for retail space in airports is so high that you can often end up paying higher prices without duty at the airport than you could pay including the duty in a regular shop in the city away from the airport. I guess this is why airport duty free shops are full of luxury items...</p>  <p>But I seem to recall being told the best way to shop when travelling overseas is to do something like buying from duty free shops in cities or somehow buying from regular shops but without duty ... but I don't know the details.</p>  <p><strong>Where can you buy things duty-free outside airports? Can any shop sell without duty to people with plane tickets? Are there duty-free shops in most cities? If it varies by country and city, what are the common variations and how can I know which is possible in a given place?</strong></p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
6	How can I visit Antarctica?	<p>A year ago I was reading some magazine, and found out that there is availability to get a trip to Antarctica.<br> Unfortunately, there was no info about how I could get there.<br> Do you know anything about it? Best way to get there, best route, maybe some feedback?</p> 
5946	Where can I buy the German environmental badge while driving to my destination in Germany?	<p>I am driving to Germany today and just noticed that I am traveling to a city which requires a  so called "Umwelt-plakette" or environmental badge to enter. Normally you need to order them in advance. Is it possible to buy them somewhere while on the road?</p> 
12922	Do rental cars in France come with the two legally required breathalyzers?	<p>As of June 2012 France <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18662555" rel="nofollow">requires</a> all cars / drivers to carry two self-test breathalyzers.</p>  <p>Do all rental car companies supply them and if I use one what is the charge associated with it?</p> 
981	What's the name for the "blocking" stickers used on car headlights?	<p>I'll be driving my car from Belgium to the UK, with plans to then drive around the country. </p>  <p>Like most cars in the European mainland, my car's headlights/headlamps are slightly adjusted to the right side of the road. When driving in the UK, though, this blinds oncoming traffic. That's why there's a type of sticker made to apply to headlights to prevent this problem, and why these stickers are required in the UK for right-hand drive cars.</p>  <p>When I lived in the Netherlands, you could buy them in almost any town. In Belgium, where I live now, few shops sell them.</p>  <p>I'm having trouble finding them, partly because I don't remember what they're actually called. Does anyone know the proper name of these "blocking" stickers so I can search for them on the Internet?</p> 
2796	Long term travel without being wealthy - how is it possible?	<p>Some people are practically most of the time traveling, from country to country, for a very long periods and sometimes even years. </p>  <p>How could one be able to travel for a long period of time, over several countries around the world, without being wealthy?</p> 
956	What is the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA?	<p>Given the extensive time taken for immigration formalities in the US, what is the shortest time to consider between connecting flights in the US, when coming from abroad?</p>  <p>Until now I have always entered the US at my destination. This is not always the cheapest option. I was told that 3 hours is the advised time to go through immigration and boarding of a connecting flight. Online booking sites still offer connecting flights, with a transfer times sometimes even less then 1 hour. </p> 
1874	Which transportation is best from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport to Hua Hin?	<p>What is the most cost effective way to get from the Suvarnabhumi Airport to Hua Hin (on Thailand's northwestern Gulf coast)? And how much would that be compared to a taxi ride?</p> 
7808	What is ticket reconfirmation and why does it exist?	<p>I have never personally had to reconfirm the ticket, but have read that in some case you can lose a place on a flight, even if you paid for it!</p>  <p>Where does the idea of ticket reconfirmation comes from? How to find out that you are required to reconfirm the ticket? Does it only applies to agencies of also to bookings made via website? Can an agent reconfirm your ticket already at the time of purchase?</p> 
14082	Is it possible to make a decent income from travelling the world?	<p>My dream is to be able to travel the world and have a new adventure every day. With the internet, every day I'm able to see this beautiful and unique world, but those are only photos. I want to experience those places and cultures.</p>  <p>There are some things, of course, I have to think about, and the one most important is <strong>income</strong>. How do I support myself while travelling the world? The first thing I think is <em>What are my talents?</em></p>  <p>I'm a software engineer and love everything about software and the open source world. I'm a hard gamer and love to play a variety of games. I have very little experience with video and photo editing (Photoshop and After Effects), but the little I had with that, I enjoyed it. <strong>How can I make a decent salary writing software while travelling the world?</strong></p>  <p>I've also thought about writing a blog about my day-to-day adventures, and maybe even making a Youtube channel with vlogs about my day-to-day adventures. If I were to do that, how successful do you think it would be? If it was, how well could that support me (or how much money do you think I can make)? I also thought about photography, and to take photos and to sell them online, if that's possible.</p>  <p>Of course, there are things that, as a normal citizen, I wouldn't have to pay like house payment (though I would be paying rent or for a hotel which may or may not be less), car payment (though I would rent cars when I needed to), home internet (I could use Wi-Fi at local shops if applicable), entertainment (most likely if I'm travelling the world, I will have less concern about what new movies or games are coming out), etc.</p>  <p>I make a pretty good salary and have GREAT benefits including health care, retirement, etc. For me, it would be hard to let go of those kind of things. Is it possible while travelling the world to get some sort of health care? I hate to sound negative, but what happens if I need surgery but can't afford it, could I not get health care? And how would I take care of my retirement? What happens when I'm old and decrepit and don't move around as well as now?</p>  <p>It's that time in my life where sitting behind a desk, 40 hours a week, 5 days a week just isn't cutting it. Has anybody here or anybody you know of attempted this? How successful were they?</p> 
11728	How to "speak" Russian, if you don't speak Russian?	<p>I saw this really amazing film, called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1651118/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Chapiteau show</a>. It is one of those films, after which, you want to go there. Although it is a Russian film, imdb shows that it is filmed in the Crimea (Ukraine). The landscape looked so exciting, that I immediately started to surf on the Internet to find anything there is to find.</p>  <p>According to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Crimea">Wikitravel</a>, it is a safe and nice location, only you need to communicate in Russian (or Tatar). So there is the problem, I don't speak Russian (nor Tatar). Do I need to first do an extensive course in Russian, before going there, or are there tricks to manage a superficial level of communication?</p> 
457	LAX to Anaheim - how much slower is the Super Shuttle than a cab?	<p>I am flying to LAX and need to get to the Anaheim Hilton (essentially the convention centre). Although it's only 29 miles, I am told it will take 90 minutes and cost $100 by cab. That's quite a cab fare, so I am thinking of the Super Shuttle. Problem is, every time I try the shuttle, it seems we spend 30-45 minutes driving around the airport, and then go to everyone else's hotels (and homes!) first, adding what feels like another hour to the trip.</p>  <p>Since I'll be landing at 10pm California time, which will feel like 1am, I'm really not up for that. But perhaps the freeway part of the journey is the bigger part, and it won't be that bad? Does anyone have experience with cabs, shuttles etc specifically from LAX to Anaheim, and suggestions for which I should choose?</p> 
13958	Japanese etiquette: Most common (and offensive) mistakes?	<p>I am aware that Japan has many unwritten rules of etiquette.

4136	Where can I eat a guinea pig in Ecuador?	<p>In South America, <em>cuy</em> (guinea pig) is a local specialty, and is supposed to taste like rabbit or chicken. Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig#South_America">claims</a> that it is to be found in the highland areas of Ecuador, but doesn't elaborate much on its availability in the coastal regions. </p>  <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Cuy_Guinea_Pig_Dish_SG.jpg" alt="Yummy roasted guinea pig"></p>  <p><sup>Image source - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aCuy_Guinea_Pig_Dish_SG.jpg">Wikipedia</a></sup></p>  <p>So, I'm interested whether it's a common sight in restaurants in the Ecuador Sierra in general, but especially in Guayaquil and surrounding areas -- I would definitely like to nibble on one of those sweet, sweet rodents! Also, slightly off-topic, are there any health concerns related to consuming guinea pork (is it still called pork?) that can affect my gentle European stomach?</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p>

3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p> 
7076	How best to prevent data loss while travelling?	<p>For my next long holidays I have some massive travel plans. I'll spend some months in remote areas and I plan to take a lot of pictures with my digital camera. Although my SD card is kinda big, I would like to backup my pictures on a remote location for various reasons:</p>  <ol> <li><p>If someone steals my camera, I do not lose all my pictures</p></li> <li><p>I have more space on my SD card if I can delete old images from time to time</p></li> <li><p>I have a backup if the SD card fails for some reasons</p></li> <li><p>I do not lose all my pictures if I forget to take my camera with me</p></li> </ol>  <p>Now I have some problems:</p>  <ol> <li><p>We are talking about storing around 20'000 pictures, each about 6 MB data, so I need a place to store 120 GB data. That's not a problem on my personal computer, but it is more problematic to get such a amount of data hosted</p></li> <li><p>Somehow I have to transfer the data. Normally I would just ftp it, but since I'm in very remote areas, I'm not sure if there is always a FTP client or a CLI available.</p></li> <li><p>I'm not sure if all computers I will have to use during my travel have a SD card adapter or at least a USB plug.</p></li> </ol>  <p>So concerning all these issue, what is the best option to prevent data loss while traveling?</p> 
6358	What is preferable, Eurail Pass or Buying Pass on the spot?	<p>I plan to visit 3 countries in Europe during May: Paris, Italy and England ( in that order). I will be staying in each country for 1 week; at the end of the week I will be moving on from a country to another. </p>  <p>Edit: Here are more updates on my research. This is my travelling schedule:</p>  <ol> <li>Paris</li> <li>Bordeaux</li> <li>Lyon</li> <li>Milan</li> <li>Florence</li> <li>Rome</li> <li>London </li> </ol>  <p>I plan to use Eurail pass when I travel from Paris to Rome, and I will take a flight from Rome to London.</p>  <p>My question is, is it more worthwhile to by a <a href="http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/select-pass/3-countries" rel="nofollow">Selected Pass with three countries ( because the train from Lyon to Milan stops by Geneva)</a>, or is it more worthwhile to buy the ticket separately?</p> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
9218	Renting a car in Ireland & Great Britain: 1 rental or 2?	<p>My wife, two kids and I will be traveling in Ireland and the UK Nov. 1st through 21st. We're flying into and out of Dublin. Our plan is to do a clockwise tour: Fly into Dublin -> Belfast -> Scotland -> England/London -> Back to Dublin to fly home.</p>  <p>We've been planning to rent a car when we land in Dublin (doing just things outside Dublin at the start of the trip) and have a car all the way until London, then turn in the car and take a train/ferry to get back to Dublin before flying home.</p>  <p>However, reading through the car rental section of Rick Steve's 2012 Ireland book is causing us to question if this is the right plan.  He says (p. 480):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If your trip covers both Ireland and Great Britain, you're better off   with two separate car rentals, rather than paying for your car to ride   the ferry between the two islands. On an all-Ireland trip, you can   drive your rental car from the Republic of Ireland into Northern   Ireland, but be aware of drop-off charges ($75-150) if you return it   in the North.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So it seems like he recommends against doing one car rental for both islands, but he also recommends against renting in the Republic of Ireland and returning it in Northern Ireland (our other option for our current itinerary).  So we're not sure which is best here.  A few questions about this:</p>  <ul> <li><p>If we do one car rental all the way from Dublin to London, will there be a similar $75-$150 fee?</p></li> <li><p>Is there an easy place to return a car on the Northern Ireland side of one of the Northern Ireland -> Scotland ferries, and an easy place on the Scotland side to rent a car?  We'd like to minimize the number of buses/whatever we need to take between car rentals since we'll be lugging around car seats for both of our children (on top of carrying them and our luggage).</p></li> <li><p>Will one way be significantly cheaper than the other?  Besides the basic cost of taking the car on the ferry and the drop-off charges, our credit card will cover insurance in Scotland/England but not in Ireland, so we could potentially get a better rental rate by renting a second vehicle once we're on Great Britain. Although, I know you often get a better rate when keeping a car rental for longer, so that may negate any benefit from the credit card covering the insurance.</p></li> </ul> 
13900	Best way from Central Rotterdam to Europoort	<p>I'm going to a conference in Rotterdam (Maassilo, Maashaven Zuidzijde 1-2) next week (friday) and need to get to the Europoort for my ferry home straight afterwards. </p>  <p>I've booked a seat on the bus from the central train station, but it leaves before the conference finishes which means I'll have miss the end in order to get home.</p>  <p>A taxi would be about €90 which is a way too much for me, and I can't seem to find another route (bus, metro, etc). </p>  <p>So, does anyone have any advice on how I can stay for the end of my conference (17:00), and maybe a few drinks after, but still make my 19:30 (latest) checking? </p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I've accepted Bart's answer as correct because there doesn't seem to be any cheap and fast route from Maashaven to Europoort. I had to leave the conference early to make it to the coach laid on by P&amp;O. I'll update this question again if I go back and figure something better out.</p> 
14423	Transferring luggage when taking another plane	<p>I have flight where I need to move from airplane to another. Do I need to check out my luggage and then check it in again, or will it be automaticaly transfered to another plane?</p> 
14211	How can I find out what the typical "fast food" is for a particular country?	<p>Everyone has to eat and travelers are no exception.  When arriving to a new destination sometimes it's not easy to find a place and one just chooses a quick and known McDs place or Burger something.</p>  <p>But why not transform a quick meal into a travelling experience? every place has its own traditional fast food / street food. Not expensive, quick, widely available and easy to eat. Eg.: in Porto/Portugal you have "Francesinha" cheap enough and widely available. In the Netherlands you have fish shops selling herring or fried fish.</p>  <p>I wonder if there is such a website or resource which provides this information about other "typical" fast food around the world?</p>  <p>It can be either specific to the country or even cities themselfs.</p> 
13680	Are there any websites or resources for planning bicycle routes across western Europe?	<p>A friend and I are potentially interested in doing a bicycle tour across parts of western Europe, which parts specifically we're not sure of yet. We would be starting in London and from there we would likely go to France.</p>  <p>We aren't really sure of how to go about planning any routes however. Google maps seems to have little to no cycle routes or information on the continent, following the given car route may not be entirely suitable either.</p>  <p>Are there any good resources for planning bicycle friendly routes?</p> 
6553	Riding in a military jet	<p>I remember that there was a possibility that one could take a ride in a military MiG.  I think at one point the cost was $15k.</p>  <p>Are there any other places that would allow a person to take such a ride?</p> 
13715	Re-enter USA from Canada with Visa Waiver Program	<p>My wife and I are doing a North America trip this summer.</p>  <p>We fly to NYC, stay a couple of days, then fly to Vancouver, spend two weeks in British Columbia and then back home (Germany).</p>  <p>We thought about travelling to Seattle a few days with our rental car, when we are in BC.</p>  <p>My question is, if there is any issue, when we reenter USA from Canada after leaving NYC a couple of days earlier? We both use Visa Waiver Program (German citizen).</p> 
291	Is it possible to travel through Burma (Myanmar), entering at one border crossing and exiting at another?	<p>I know that it is possible to enter Burma/Myanmar from several border crossing with neighbouring countries, and I'm pretty sure that from some of them at least you do not have to be on a package tour.</p>  <p>But I have been unable despite much searching to find out for sure whether it's possibly to enter Burma from a border crossing with one country and exit via a border crossing with a different country?</p>  <p>If so, which countries and which border crossings would this be possible at?</p> 
6435	Sim Card with data plan in China?	<p>I'm traveling to Beijing for a short trip (4 days), and don't want to be without my phone or pay ATT roaming. I have an unlocked, international compatible phone.</p>  <p>What kind of options are available in Beijing? I like data. Especially in 3G.</p>  <p>Should I just buy something from CM at the Beijing airport? Or do I need to plan ahead of time?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
11645	Re-entering the US after leaving on a visa waiver program	<p>in late Feb I'll be travelling to the USA on the visa waiver program, after my 3 months is up I wish to spend 2 weeks in South America, then return to the States, am I able to do this? Or do I need to return my home country? </p>  <p>Do I also need to book my flight from the US to South America beforehand? At the moment I wish to book a flight to the USA with a return flight 6 months and 2 weeks later, bookng my (visa run) flight while there.</p>  <p>I know getting a B2 visa sounds more simple, however being in northwest Australia I live more then 1000 km away from a US consulate, therefore it is cheaper and less time-consuming to book a 2 week stay in South America.</p> 
4901	Are there any legal requirements for renting a car in the US as a foreigner?	<p>I am planning a road trip in the US with some friends and plan to rent a car for the purpose. Are there any legal requirements for renting a car.</p>  <p>Do they require a US driver's license?<br> Do I have to pay for extra insurance?</p> 
122	How do I know if it's safe to travel to a country at a specific time?	<p>Are there travel sites constantly updated with safety tips and political situation of countries?</p> 
73	Is it safe to travel in Japan considering the nuclear situation?	<p>Are there any areas that should be avoided and are there any steps I should take to protect myself from radiation? </p> 
14480	Can I land in a different time zone before my take off time?	<p>Theoretically, it should be possible to land before taking off (if you go on a fast enough airplane between two cities close to a time-zone boundary).</p>  <p>Practically, are there any such flights, even if they were on opposite sides of the international date line?</p> 
14165	Where can I visit former Nazi camps and prisons in Europe?	<p>Some months ago I visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Documentation_Centre_of_the_City_of_Cologne">NS Documentation Center of the City of Cologne</a>. The museum was very interesting for me because the building wasn't destroyed during World War II and I could see the former Gestapo prison with inscriptions and drawings done by prisoners on the walls.  </p>  <p>Now I am looking for other museums in Europe dedicated to memorializing the victims of the Nazi regime like prisons and concentration camps where I can see more than just photos and videos, or some memorials built after the war. I want to see the death camps from inside, prison cells or gas chambers.</p> 
26	What should I know about "Around The World" flights?	<p>I have heard rumours of such things, and have had a difficult time find information on "around the world" flights.  Are they worth it (do you have a limit between usage, do you save money.. etc.) and are there easy ways of getting more informed on them (specific sites, travel agencies)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> With the goal of maximum continental coverage, no specific start or finish locations</p> 
1080	Do infants need their own seats on long flights?	<p>What is the best way to approach a long (8+ hours) flight with a young child (1-2 years old)?</p>  <p>It seems I am not required to purchase a seat for a child under two years of age which would save some money.  But is that actually advisable?  It seems it would be convenient to put the child in his own seat rather than being forced to hold him for hours in an already cramped environment.</p> 
4771	Fastest way to get from Heathrow Airport to Knightsbridge London?	<p>I'm looking for the fastest way to get from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Knightsbridge,%20London,%20United%20Kingdom&amp;daddr=Heathrow%20Airport%20London,%20London,%20United%20Kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=51.497763,-0.173421&amp;sspn=0.015549,0.045447&amp;geocode=FfDOEQMdokL9_ykNBuZ7XAV2SDEGqBJbiLmQkQ;FTpjEQMd7Rj5_yFnQfZDVVPnjw&amp;oq=Knigh&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=12">London Heathrow Airport to Knightsbridge, London</a>. Using Google maps, I found that the tube takes approximately 50 minutes. But are there any cheaper options? Maybe an express bus? Or a train?</p> 
6545	Booking travel tickets for visa without paying?	<p>I am in the process of filling the forms for my wife and daughter (Chinese) to travel with me (British) to the UK for a short holiday. On the government advice located at <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/out-of-country/visitors.pdf">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/out-of-country/visitors.pdf</a> it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Accommodation and travel details</p>      <p>You may wish to submit  the following documents to help show us your   accommodation and travel arrangements in the UK and on which date you   intend to leave the UK. We advise that you do not make any payments   for accommodation,  travel and so on until you have received your   visa. </p>      <ul>   <li>Details of accommodation and return</li>   <li>travel bookings</li>   </ul>      <p>This could be:</p>      <ul>   <li>hotel booking confirmation (usually email) travel booking</li>   <li>confirmation (can be email or copy of tickets) travel agent</li>   <li>confirmation of both accommodation details with a supporting letter    from the occupant confirming  that you are able to stay there</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>But how do you have tickets for a flight if you haven't made payments. All airlines I've seen require you to pay in full before they issue any tickets.</p>  <p>What is the best way to satisfy this requirement?</p> 
10128	Flight with stopover: How to find a similar flight but with 1-week stopover?	<p>Using some website, the cheapest <code>Tokyo→Paris</code> flight has a 5-hours stopover in Dubai.</p>  <p>I would like to make this stopover 7-days, so that I can visit around that place too.</p>  <p>I can't express this requirement on any of the websites I have tried.<br> <code>Tokyo→Dubai</code> + <code>Dubai→Paris</code> is almost twice as expensive.</p>  <p>What is a good way to get this week-long stopover without paying much more?<br> Should I go to an agency? Are there websites that have this feature?</p> 
8105	Is it easy to get prepaid SIMs in the US/Canada?	<p>I'll be travelling in a family party to the east coast of the US and Canada and, as most people know, travelling in a party means you often need to keep in contact when seeing different things and trying to meet up, etc.  We were wondering if it's easy to get prepaid SIMs for our (Australian) phones and use them while we were over there?  </p>  <p>Are there any catches to be aware of?  Can the same SIMs be used for Canada (Toronto) and the US, or should we just restrict ourselves to US-only ones?  What about data quotas for smart phones?</p> 
10390	I am looking for a hotel search engine for rural areas	<p>I am trying to find a bucolic holiday destination, which means finding a nice hotel in a small beautiful village for spending some quiet time.  Most search engines are only finding major cities, and famous tourist-oriented places; for me one main factor is that it is not too far from the airport, and in my case I would like to find somewhere in southern Europe.</p>  <p><strong>I am looking for a hotel search engine for rural areas.</strong>   </p> 
1677	Are there data plans for travelers in the USA?	<p>I intend to travel to the US for a month, and I would really like to use a lot of data traffic during the trip, for browsing, maps, Skype calls, etc. How can I do that? Should I buy a SIM? Do I have to order one in advance, or are data SIMs readily available in the airport? Is there any website that can show me competing options and maybe compare them?</p>  <p>Also, I guess SIMs are linked to one specific carrier. Does it matter which cellular carrier I choose, or do all have similar coverage and do all support GSM phones? Does it change from state to state? e.g. do some of the more states, like Hawaii, have limited coverage for some of the carriers?</p>  <p>In short I am clueless here, and would really appreciate any information about this.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: meanwhile I have found <a href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">this comparison between various data sim suppliers</a>, seems very useful though I'm not sure how reliable or up-to-date this page is.</p> 
10725	What is the protocol for taking a last minute cruise?	<p>If you have the flexibility to take a last minute cruise, what's the best way to find and take advantage of any deals that might occur at the last minute?  How can you find such a thing?  How many days (hours?) before crusing do cruise lines reduce prices so as to not let cabins go empty?  Are there third parties that bulk buy cabins and if they can't sell them, they have to dispose of them quickly?</p> 
10957	How can you protect a fragile object like bottle of champagne in your baggage against breaking?	<p>I tend to bring something quite fragile with me as cabin luggage. On my next journey I want to bring a special bottle of champagne (because of sentimental reasons). Unfortunately you can't bring a bottle with you as cabin luggage.</p>  <p>I already know that it is okay to bring a bottle of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10928/is-it-okay-to-bring-a-bottle-of-champagne-on-an-airplane-as-checkin-luggage">champagne</a> as check-in luggage (even confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KLM/status/275517290571788288">the airline (Dutch)</a>.)  I am wondering how you can transport a bottle of champagne in your luggage in such a way it doesn't break easily.</p> 
11683	Can I travel to Kuwait on a visa with old passport number?	<p>I have a Kuwait visa, obtained from a hotel in Kuwait, with my old passport number. But as the validity of the present passport is expiring within 6 months, I got a new passport with a new passport number. Can I travel with the same visa or do I have to obtain a new visa with my new passport number?</p> 
16036	What's the longest take-off run of a commercial flight?	<p>I listen to the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/drkarl/scienceontriplej/" rel="nofollow">Dr Karl podcast</a> where in a recent one he stated the longest take off run was by a C-130 (Hercules) plane in Greenland a long while back (I gather it was some unusual condition and not a commercial flight).</p>  <p>I'm wondering which commercial flight has the longest take-off run? Presumably a bigger plane, with a large fuel load for a long-haul flight, chock-full of passengers.</p> 
8314	Re-checking luggage at connecting airports	<p>I'll be leaving Morocco within the next week, and I'm wondering whether I'll need to re-check my luggage after my connecting flights. I fly from Casablanca to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to London via Lufthansa. From London I fly to Newark, this time with United Airlines. Will my luggage automatically be put onto all of my connecting flights, or will I be responsible for handling this?</p>  <p>I'm somewhat nervous about the Casablanca and Frankfurt airports. In Casablanca, I don't know how easy it will be to check in since I speak no French and only a little Arabic. In Frankfurt, I only have 54 minutes between my flight to London. And that's if the flight is perfectly on schedule. Will things at the Casablanca airport be fine? And is 54 minutes (potentially less) enough time to go through security and board my next flight?</p> 
7118	Changing planes at Frankfurt	<p>I am planning a trip to Rome, Italy from Bangalore, India. </p>  <p>Looking at the flight tickets, it will be 30% cheaper for me to book the Bangalore-Frankfurt and Frankfurt-Rome legs separately rather than as one ticket. They are all on Lufthansa though.</p>  <p>If I booked the tickets separately, when changing planes at Frankfurt, would I have to claim my checked in baggage and recheck in? Would it be possible to check the baggage through to Rome at my origin airport, Bangalore?</p> 
6732	What is the most expensive train ride in India?	<p>Considering a lot of people use trains in India, train tickets tend to be cheap, depending on class of travel, of course.</p>  <p>What I am interested in is finding out which train ride or which route (since there can be different types of trains on the same route) has the most expensive one way ticket for each of the following classes - General compartment, Sleeper class, any of the AC classes (it will most likely be 1AC but perhaps I'm wrong) and finally AC chair or any other uncommon class.</p>  <p>As a bonus question I'd like to get a list of deluxe tourist trains such as <a href="http://www.palaceonwheels.net/">Palace on wheels</a> and prices for those trains.</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
2176	How can I travel to the North Pole, cheaply?	<p>I'm aware that annually there's a <a href="http://www.npmarathon.com/">North Pole marathon</a>, and that would be one way of getting up there, if exhausting.</p>  <p>What other options exist to get there, preferably economically (the marathon costs are mildly frightening and extremely prohibitive without sponsorship - <code>€11,900</code>).</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cvEGu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br> <strong>PROVISIONAL SCHEDULE FOR 2012</strong></p>  <pre><code>April 5 Arrive at Spitsbergen (Norway) April 6 Fly to North Pole Camp &amp; 90N April 7 North Pole Marathon April 8 Return to Spitsbergen (Norway) April 9 Return to Homeland </code></pre> 
10553	How to travel (relatively) cheaply by ICE trains in Germany?	<p>When I first checked prices for ICE trains in Germany, I was a bit shocked by prices of over 100 Euros (in Poland not long ago the trains were the cheapest way of public transport). </p>  <p>But then I found out that there are some promotions such as <a href="http://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/ueberblick/bahncard25.shtml?dbkanal_003=L01_S01_D001_KAF0001_affilinet-3101-BahnCard25-148420_LZ01" rel="nofollow">BahnCard 25</a> and it's possible to travel cheaply if you <a href="http://www.spartipp.de/reise/bahn/29-euro-bahn-fahrkarten-fuer-ic-und-ice-deutschlandweit.html" rel="nofollow">book the ICE in advance</a> (something similar to a plane).</p>  <p>But how is it in practice with these promotions? How to use them to really save money, for example, when someone wants to do a round trip once a month?</p> 
11648	Is there a list of online public transportation planners?	<p>For Oslo in Norway you can go to <a href="http://ruter.no/en/">ruter.no</a>, punch in where you are and where you want to go. It then gives you options on how to get from point A to point B using various public transportation (and walking).</p>  <p>Is there a list of such services in other countries somewhere? In particular I'm curious to know if there is such a service for London, UK. </p> 
8770	What are some non-Indian and non-Middle Eastern Sufi destinations around the world?	<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/subdivisions/sufism_1.shtml">What are some Sufi destinations around the world where Sufi dervishes live, like Buddhist monks, in a group?</a></p>  <p>Are there Sufi destinations in Turkey, China, Russia, Europe or any other part of the world that would be in a peaceful and war-free country?</p> 
4573	Can I spend Renminbi in Hong Kong?	<p>While travelling in Hong Kong, I noticed signs at several vendors advertising prices with the 元 character, which from my visit to Shanghai I recognized as the symbol for Yuán.</p>  <p>Since Hong Kong has its own currency, this confused me.  Do vendors accept Renminbi in Hong Kong?  Does it vary depending on where you go, or is acceptance (or non-acceptance) universal?  Does an exchange rate apply, or are HKD and RMB considered interchangeable in Hong Kong?</p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p> 
16272	Is it possible for non-military travelers to fly above the speed of sound?	<p>I know for example the Concorde flew faster than sound, but I believe the options are much more limited now. Is it possible to be in a plane that breaks the sound barrier, without having access to flights in planes like the F16?</p> 
3748	Flying with a desktop computer (as checked luggage)	<p>On an upcoming trip, I will be taking a desktop computer and monitor as checked luggage (on a United/Continental flight). What should I be aware of when doing this? What needs to be done to properly protect all the components? Are there any airline policies I should be aware of?</p> 
6802	Acquiring an international driving permit in the US	<p>After reviewing "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/441/82">Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?</a>" it seems like it might be worth my while to look into acquiring an International Driving Permit.</p>  <p>I'm having some difficulty determining exactly how one does so, however.</p>  <p>What are the requirements for obtaining an International Driving Permit as a US citizen, and where should I go to take care of the process?</p> 
16266	Can I bring my desktop computer as check-in baggage on a flight?	<p>I am moving from Malaysia to the US, and planning to bring my desktop computer with me. I plan to pack it in my checked-in luggage. Will the computer risk being damaged? Any precaution should I take to reduce this risk? Will there be any trouble with the airline or immigration about bringing computer?</p> 
12948	What are my options for pre-paid SIM cards in Buenos Aires, Argentina?	<p>I have three devices:</p>  <ol> <li>iPhone 5 - nanosim, 4G/LTE</li> <li>MiFi - microsim, 4G/LTE</li> <li>iPhone 4S - microsim, 3G</li> </ol>  <p>Which providers in Buenos Aires / Argentina have the best prepaid options for these devices? They don't all need to be from the same provider, but that would make purchasing simplest. I need voice, sms, &amp; data on both iPhones and only data on the MiFi (I can live without the MiFi).</p> 
4305	How can I get a flight with a supersonic plane?	<p>My dream is to fly with a supersonic plane. Since the Concorde is no longer active, I don't think it is possible to do this with a regular plane. So how can I get onto board of a supersonic plane? Ideally it should be in Central Europe.</p> 
2340	Are there any travel experiences in Australia that offer aboriginal (or Torres Strait) “cultural immersion”?	<p>I am wondering if it's possible for a traveller in Australia to immerse in aboriginal culture, or Torres Strait Islander culture.</p>  <p>By "immerse" I mean stay in a traditional aboriginal area where people speak the language on an everyday basis and generally live to some degree or other in a traditional way. Maybe including staying with a family and being taught some traditional skills or otherwise participating in daily life.</p>  <p>I'm from Australia and work in tourism and I think it's safe to say most Aussies would have no idea if you can do this. But it's a big country and we're pretty ignorant of our native culture.</p>  <p>For me the language aspect is important. I do know the most actively maintained indigenous languages in Australia are in <strong>Central Australia</strong> (Pitjantjara, Arrernte, Warlpiri) and <strong>Torres Strait</strong> (Kala Lagaw Ya). I also believe that traditional culture and language is practiced in <strong>Arnhem Land</strong> by the Yolngu people. But I have no idea about the state of tourism in those areas.</p> 
6711	Not flying the last segment of the first half of a return flight	<p>I have booked a A->B->C | C->B->A flight. What I want to do is to not fly the B->C segment. While skipping the final B->A would be totally fine (just walk out of the airport), I'm afraid that the airline might cancel my return flight if I skip the B->C. Should I worry about that or is this a non-issue? Also - is there any way to make it with checked luggage (for example letting them know when I check in at A that I will actually not fly all the way to C) or is that impossible?</p> 
6004	Consequence of not showing up for one leg of journey	    <p>Recently i booked a flight using my points. I am  planning to fly to Seattle WA from Indianapolis Indiana.  Stop over is Chicago.</p>  <p>On the day of my flight i am supposed to be in Chicago.   So I was wondering if i can directly board my Seattle flight from Chicago thereby not showing up in Indianapolis.</p>  <p>Is this okay?  Will united cancel my entire journey if i do not show up in Indianapolis?</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
9364	Rooftop bar in Manhattan?	<p>Currently I'm in New York. I'm looking for a rooftop bar that provides a great overview about Manhattan, but is still affordable. (20 dollar for cocktail at maximum.) Additionally, I want to go there wearing jeans and a t-shirt, so nothing too fancy.</p> 
16053	Getting from Göreme to Denizli by car	<p>What is the best car rental company to rent a car to get from Göreme to Denizli in Turkey? What I need is a reliable company, i.e. one wich I can believe will have a car for me if I make a reservation.</p>  <p>My intent is to get the car in Göreme and return it in Denizli.</p> 
3822	Child travelling with different nationality passport than mom	<p>My wife (Polish passport) is planning to travel to the USA (and some European countries) with our son who has dual Polish-British nationality. Would it cause any issues if the young one is travelling on a British passport? It seems especially convenient this way, because Polish citizens still need a visa to get to the USA, which is both expensive and humiliating to obtain. Are they going to experience any issues with American officials?</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
13504	Carrying my laptop to abroad from India	<p>When I was 14 I was going to USA with my family, my father was carrying his laptop, I was also carrying it but my dad was strictly not allowing that. Which is the solution to carry my laptop from India to abroad? </p>

14252	Availability of local train tickets in France	<p>The airplane tickets are easily ordered from travel agency. But what about local transport? I have no idea how to reserve the local transport using online reservation. For instance, I can see that there is a train for my Lyon-Grenoble round-trip in the online registration. Travel agency says that they can reserve tickets for me. Yet, might be the local ticket reservation is a stupid idea in general because local transport travels regularly? Furthermore, plane may be delayed, invalidating your train ticket. Is it better to buy local tickets locally, at the train/bus station when you go?</p> 
1628	Are there any problems crossing Kosovo's international borders or having their stamp in your passport?	<p>I'm thinking of heading from Romania to Serbia to Albania, possibly via Kosovo (on an Australian passport).</p>  <p>Since Kosovo becoming a country wasn't unanimously popular in the region I'm a bit concerned that Serbia or Albania might not fully approve of me visiting Kosovo. Are there any border crossing difficulties for tourists, or will having a Kosovo stamp in my passport cause issues when entering neighbouring countries? (Do all Kosovo's neighbours even recognize Kosovo?)</p> 
16331	What is overbooking (of flights), and why do airlines all seem to do it?	<p>I know that they want to "fill every seat."</p>  <p>If you take this LITERALLY, then you'd want to overbook, because of the statistical percentage of "no shows." That, of course, leads to "bumping" when more passengers actually show up than the statistical formulas predict.</p>  <p>But one could also define "fill every seat" as "sell every ticket," then there's no point in overbooking. From an economic point of view, a seat would be "filled" as soon as the ticket was sold. Whether or not the passenger showed up wouldn't be of concern, as long as the ticket was paid for. And if a passenger wanted to change flights, s/he could be charged a penalty to cover the expected loss on the replacement; the closer to flight time, the higher the penalty.</p>  <p>A "full" plane is a crowded plane and thus an unpleasant plane. A plane in which every ticket was sold, but there were a few "no shows" is actually nicer to ride on. It would also be easier on the plane; there would be a smaller load.</p>  <p>Can airlines be persuaded to change their objectives in passengers' favour, so there is no "bumping" and less crowding? Would it make sense for passengers to push airlines to adopt other solutions (such as charging 10%-20% more for tickets, to compensate for the lost "overbooking" option). Would this (or some other idea) be better than forcing passengers to buy first class tickets if they want to avoid being "bumped?"</p> 
8225	Is it possible to book an hotel being a minor?	<p>I've been in Morocco nearly a month, and it will soon be time for my return. During my stay here, checking into hotel rooms hasn't been an issue, but businesses aren't nearly as lenient about that sort of thing in America. I have a day layover in Newark, and I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for me to stay at one of the hotels nearby. I'm 17 years old, and my birthday is only 16 days after the time I'd need the room. Are exceptions ever made in situations like these?</p>

16426	What steps can you take to avoid being bumped from a flight?	<p>Following on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/16331/what-can-we-do-about-airlines-overbooking">from this question about Overbooking</a>, we know that airlines will often sell more tickets than there are seats on a plane, and from time to time they guess wrong and too many people actually turn up to fly. That can lead to bumping, but isn't the only reason why it might happen.</p>  <p>If you are set to fly on a flight which has more people turn up than there are seats (due to mis-judged overbooking, delays to other flights, equipment changes etc), some people sadly won't be getting the plane. What steps can you take to try to avoid being one of those people? Does class of travel or ticket price matter? Frequent Flier status? First to check in? Last? Connections? One way vs return?</p> 
16446	Ski rental for Mount Gassan	<p>I'm visiting Japan in late May, early June, and I hope to go skiing. Mount Gassan (月山, literally "moon mountain") in Yamagata prefecture seems to be my best bet - it has a ski season of April to July, with the season opening determined not by when they first get snow, but when they can get rid of enough of it to open up the roads!</p>  <p>I asked the tourism information office of Mount Gassan, and they said that ski rental isn't available in Gassan itself. Are there other locations at which ski rental is available?</p>  <p>I anticipate going by shinkansen to Yamagata city, and hiring a car from there, so something in Yamagata city, or between Yamagata city and Gassan would be ideal.</p>  <p>As a fallback, I guess I could try hiring at Zao Onsen, but that's in the opposite direction from Yamagata city as Gassan is!</p> 
2995	Venice Marco Polo Airport to Venice	<p>I am wondering if someone could suggest the cheapest method of travelling from Venice Marco Polo Airport into Venice itself. I am staying quite close to St Marks Basilica, so any travel options which would put me in that general area would be appreciated.</p> 
8747	Is it possible to get a visa for Kaliningrad in the neighboring countries?	<p>I am planning to visit Northern Poland and then Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. I am thinking of going into the Russian state of Kaliningrad as well. I've read that compared to Russia proper it is easier to get a three day tourist visa for Kaliningrad. You don't need an invitation like for main land Russia.</p>  <p>I have a German passport and will leave from Berlin in the next few days. Is it possible to get a Kaliningrad visa in Gdansk or Vilnius in a day?</p> 
13681	Visit the Norwegian fjords or other attractions when landing in Haugesund	<p>The airport of Haugesund is currently served by some low cost companies; I tried to discover some attractions of that area but on the guides I only found some lines about the city of Stavanger and almost nothing else.</p>  <p>I was wondering how difficult could it be to visit an interesting Norwegian fjord when landing in Haugesund.</p>  <p>I see from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/763/how-to-see-the-norwegian-fjords">another question</a> that I could travel from Haugesund to Bergen which is considered to be the gateway of the fjords. The problem is that Bergen is roughly two hours from Haugesund.</p>  <p>Is there an easier solution that allows me to spare the transfer to Bergen and visit an interesting fjord? Consider that the journey should be at most four days long.</p>  <p>In case there are no such solutions, are there any other peculiar attractions in the area around Haugesund that doesn't require renting a car?</p>  <p>EDIT: As Tor-Einar Jarnbjo writes in the comment, solutions could be very different depending on when the journey is going to take place. My question is mainly related to the period between late spring (May) and the beginning of the autumn (October).</p> 
13539	Are there trains without WC in the Netherlands?	<p>I have read some news that in the Netherlands there are no WCs in some short-distance trains because it would be too expensive.</p>  <p>Is it true that there are urinal bags in these trains? How can I check, if any train has a WC or not?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nswEs.jpg" alt="disposable urinal"></p> 
946	When to book tickets from travel sites rather than airline sites?	<p>When booking plane tickets, I generally buy directly from the airline's website (as it is often the lowest or near-lowest price for the destinations I travel between). However, I know there are many other travel sites like Expedia, Travelocity, or Kayak.</p>  <p>When does it make sense to buy from one of those sites instead of direct, and what are the pros and cons of tickets purchased through them?</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
9319	Are there any women-only places in the world?	<p>It looks like reports of a women-only city in Saudi Arabia are <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10739/has-saudi-arabia-announced-plans-for-a-woman-only-city">greatly exaggerated</a>. But are there any other places in the world where the population is entirely or almost entirely female?</p>  <p>The place doesn't have to be particularly large, but there has to be a cause of it being mostly female. A town with a population of five where all five happened to be female wouldn't count. Ideally, the place shouldn't just consist of a single institution. For example, a single convent far away from civilization wouldn't really count.</p>  <p>If males aren't allowed into the place at all, then having displays or exhibits about the place available nearby would be good.</p>  <p>In case anyone is wondering, this is not a duplicate of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/4887/best-world-destinations-for-dating">Best world destinations for dating</a> !</p> 
16649	Are there any man-only places in the world?	<p>I know it is forbidden to enter to Muslim's mosques/shrines without proper Islamic cover or having your shoes during walking through temples/tombs/shrines in India and some other Hindu countries or without proper cover going to a Christian church or monastery but I mean a man-only place which do not let any woman with any kind of cover and religion or proper considerations comes in. </p>  <p>P.S: It is not about divided places which both men and women can go there separately but man-only places.</p> 
3455	Tips for getting a visa when there's no embassy in one's country of residence	<p>I'm looking for general tips about how to get a visa cheaply when there are no embassies in one's country of residence.  This has prevented us from getting visas more than one time.  Think e.g. non-EU citizen living in Malta, a small country with only a handful of embassies and (expensive) flying being the only option to travel to neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>Some observations:</p>  <ul> <li><p>The "standard" way to get the visa would be to travel to a neighbouring country (Italy in the case of Malta) two times: once to apply, and one to collect the visa.  (Note that the passport is needed for return, hence the need for going again to collect it instead of trying to get the passport mailed back).</p></li> <li><p>Embassies don't seem to be open <em>officially</em> to applications either in mail or through a third person.</p></li> <li><p>From the answers I get I have the impression that the people working at embassies are often not confident about what is allowed in what isn't.  Perhaps sometimes they say no to reuqests such as sending the application through a third person only to "be safe".  I'm not really sure how to handle them.  They might give different replies when calling twice ...</p></li> <li><p>There tend to be honorary consulates in small countries, often managed by companies, which may or may not be helpful with this.  One time they offered a 200 EUR service fee, which was actually several times the visa fee and not worth it ...</p></li> </ul>  <p>So do any of you have experience with this?  Have you been in a similar situation?  Do you have any tips on how to avoid travelling abroad twice (very costly!!) to get a visa when there's no local embassy?</p> 
13110	Will my European phone (Nokia 1208) work in the USA?	<p>I have a Nokia 1208 bought in Sweden with a pre-paid SIM-card from Telia. Will I be able to use my mobile phone in the USA? I'm not talking about expensive roaming fees or so, just whether it's possible at all.

14853	What is wrong with eating while walking in Japan? It doesn't seem to be an issue in other Asian countries	<p>I have seen on many etiquette questions about Japan that this is a no no, but I can't seem to find what the reason for this is. I know that in countries like Taiwan or China it doesn't seem to be an issue at all, so I would like to know why there is such a difference.</p>  <p>Also, does this also apply to any public places, or just while moving around?</p> 
5246	How to avoid having my drink spiked in a bar	<p>How do I avoid being the victim of drink spiking in a bar? (As in spiking to steal money or commit credit card fraud, not for sexual assualt)</p>  <p>Presumably I should avoid places promoted by touts from Africa. Are places advertised on the internet generally safe, or should I only go to places listed in reputable tourist guides?</p>  <p>Does it only happen at hostess bars, or does it happen at non-"adult" venues as well?</p>  <p>Does it only happen in a few districts in Tokyo, or does it also happen in other cities?</p>

2328	How to choose a good travel insurance policy?	<p>When looking for travel insurance, there is a dizzying array of companies, policies, plans, restrictions, and conditions. What should a short-term traveler look for in an insurance plan? What things should you watch out for? Are there any companies or plans in particular that are commonly recommended for travelers?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> To make this more specific, I'm looking for a general travel insurance policy for a single traveler in good health traveling for a few weeks to a few months. It should be comprehensive enough to cover basically any medical issue that could arise while traveling in most parts of the world. I know there are hundreds of plans that fit this criteria, so my question is: are there any major aspects that set some plans apart from others, or are they basically all the same? Are there a few companies that are frequently highly recommended for travelers, or is there not much difference between the companies out there?</p> 
405	Are there any standard clothing restrictions when visiting mosques?	<p>I know from visiting many catholic churches that many require knees and shoulders to be covered, so dressing appropriately is essential for hassle-free travel. Are there similar rules that might apply when visiting a mosque?</p> 
13845	How do I minimize total cost of separate flights to the same destination plus optionally accommodation?	<p>My girlfriend and I are currently living in different countries, and meet occasionally for a few days every month or so. We don't really care all that much where we are going, as long as we don't need a visa (we're both in EU), just so we are at the same place and time for a couple of days. </p>  <p>In short:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I'm flying from airport <strong>AAA</strong>, she's flying from airport <strong>BBB</strong>, we need to find an airport <strong>XXX</strong> (not an euphemism!) which is cheapest to fly to overall.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Bonus task:</strong> Flights are first and foremost, and we could live with a somewhat more expensive accommodation as long as we can get in and out easily. Since the accommodation cost is comparable to flight cost for such a short stay, we'd like to have some sort of rough idea what we're going to pay for a certain type of accommodation, for example three-star hotel. </p> 
13086	Mobile providers and mobile internet in Thailand?	<p>I'm traveling to Thailand for three weeks and I was hoping to get a local Sim card while there, to be able to contact home, people I meet, and use the internet.</p>  <p>Which networks are available and do any of these offer reliable internet access?</p>  <p>What sort of costs will be involved with getting local mobile access?</p> 
15995	Stage 15 of le tour ending at Mont Ventoux - how to get there?	<p>I am playing with the thought of getting down to France to see some of the 100th edition of <a href="http://www.letour.fr" rel="nofollow">le tour</a>.

Is it viable to stay in or near Gap and visit Mont Ventoux over day for the stage finish?</p> 
77	Flight deals from the UK	<p>Can someone recommend a good website with flight deals from London/UK, which I could subscribe to? I mean promotions in different airlines, e.g. bmi used to have a bmifriday promotion (not sure if its still ongoing).</p> 
1712	How can I maximize my chances of obtaining a Russian visa outside my home country?	<p>I had been sure from topics here and on other forums that it was not possible for me as an Australian citizen to obtain a visa for the Russian Federation anywhere other than the Russian Embassy in Australia and that many other nationalities could also only apply in their home countries?</p>  <p>But in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/1709/140">a comment posted on another question today</a> our user <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/users/693/roflcoptr">Roflcopter</a> states that they were able to obtain Russian visas as a Lichstenstein citizen in both Switzerland and Germany.</p>  <p>So for once and for all, what is the possibility in reality for an Australian to obtain a Russian visa while not in Australia? Was roflcopter subject to special rules due to their country being especially small or do the rules vary from country to country? Or are there not really rules with everything depending more on luck and how friendly the officials you deal with at any particular Russian embassy or consulate might be?</p>  <p>(In case it makes a difference, I'm in Georgia now.)</p>

I've never done couch-surfing and I'd like to start couch-surfing in my next trip, but I don't know what the host "expects". Do I have to take something in exchange for his/her offer?

911	What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?	<p>I've travelled a lot.  Living in New Zealand or the UK means anywhere is likely a flight, but I've always flown economy.  Twice between LA and Auckland I managed to get the exit row after talking nicely to the check-in girl, but apart from that, nothing.  I've spoken to ticket agents, tried 'check in chicken' (where you wait until the last minute before checking in, hoping there's an overbooking of economy) but have never managed to get an upgrade, while others I know seemingly get them quite often.  What strategy have you used or do you suggest to achieve this?</p>  <p>My next flight is from Melbourne to Tokyo, and I plan on trying all of these ;)</p>  <p>(Related questions on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17183/101">car hire</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17026/101">hotel</a> upgrades)</p>

I'm not a U.S citizen (have business visa, though), so I would like to know if it is allowed to leave the airport while waiting for the next flight (I'd like to buy some stuff in the U.S).</p>  <p>--- UPDATE ---</p>  <p>Thank you all for answers and comments. It's answered, but can anyone comment on this (I don't want to create another question just for this little thing): if I have 1:30 to do shopping, is it possible to get to an Apple Store or BestBuy?

11728	How to "speak" Russian, if you don't speak Russian?	<p>I saw this really amazing film, called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1651118/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Chapiteau show</a>. It is one of those films, after which, you want to go there. Although it is a Russian film, imdb shows that it is filmed in the Crimea (Ukraine). The landscape looked so exciting, that I immediately started to surf on the Internet to find anything there is to find.</p>  <p>According to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Crimea">Wikitravel</a>, it is a safe and nice location, only you need to communicate in Russian (or Tatar). So there is the problem, I don't speak Russian (nor Tatar). Do I need to first do an extensive course in Russian, before going there, or are there tricks to manage a superficial level of communication?</p> 
17102	How do you know if a Japanese person means no when they say yes?	<p>I have come across a few situations when a Japanese person will extend themselves beyond what they probably should to help people. I am often worried when asking them to do something that they will not refuse for whatever reason. I am wondering if there is a way to ask them for help so that you can give them the opportunity to decline without them feeling bad or to gauge their response and if they don't really want to them to tell them not to worry about it.</p>  <p>I haven't had any particular experience with other cultures where this is a real problem, but on many occasions (both in Japan and outside of Japan) this has led to some awkward situations where I didn't realize that they were not really going to be quite as helpful as they suggested in their response.</p>

But I'd informed the graduate office, my professor and completed the necessary formalities.</p>  <p>Will I face an issue if I were to travel to the US again. Do I need to reapply for a US visa since I already have a B1/B2 visa which is still valid?</p> 
16602	Why is buying an airline ticket from the company more expensive than from an aggregator like Skyscanner?	<p>I mostly travel with StarAlliance - SAS since its offers fit my business needs the best. I have been using the <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/" rel="nofollow">Skyscanner</a> website, but yesterday, I bought my ticket directly from the SAS website.</p>  <p>I noticed that the ticket I bought on the SAS website was four euros more expensive than the tickets I normally buy from Skyscanner.

What tips or tricks can you use to get upgraded to a larger/better/nicer room?</p>  <p>I normally join the frequent stay program for the relevant hotel chain - if it's part of a chain - and most of them have various elite levels - in my experience, becoming a higher level in those programs is one easy way.</p>  <p>However, what other approaches are there?

14448	Where can I find short term apartment rental offers in Berlin?	<p>I'm looking to rent an apartment in Berlin for three months starting in April.</p>  <p>What websites / real estate agents / vacation rental companies exist for renting an apartment long term in Berlin?</p>  <p>I've used Airbnb in the past, but for such a long stay it's too expensive. In the US I would check Craigslist, but it doesn't seem like a popular site in Berlin.</p>  <p>Alternatively, are there any services in Berlin that I could pay for help finding an apartment?</p> 
12936	Ski Resorts during the Northern Hemisphere's Summer	<p>I am wondering what Ski Resorts are available (open) for skiing during the Northern Hemisphere's summer?</p>  <p>Level of comfort and amenities don't really make a difference for the purposes of this question.</p> 
13600	The penalty for changing an airline ticket is per leg or per ticket?	<p>I am wondering what happens with my penalty with a ticket were I am almost certain I will need to change the date of one of the middle legs and subsequently changing all the legs which follow, for example:</p>  <pre><code>Tokyo - Sydney - San Francisco - New York </code></pre>  <p>If I decide to move everything from my <code>Sydney</code> leg 1 week forward, will that be considered as 3 different penalties or just 1?</p> 
10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
13242	Single/Multiple entry Schengen Visa for visiting Italy and Croatia	<p>I am from India, and I plan to visit Europe for a month. I will be starting with Switzerland, and then I plan to go to Croatia.  If I have a single entry Schengen Visa, go to Croatia, will I be allowed to enter back into a Schengen country (maybe Italy)? Or, do I need a multiple entry Schengen Visa?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p> 
2495	Cheap pre-pay sim in Canada?	<p>I have my UK-based Android smartphone, but yay for Orange (sarcasm), it's locked and will take 3 weeks to unlock!  Fortunately I also have a low-tech Nokia - I just need a sim.  Rogers quoted me <em>$70 CAD</em> to get up and running with a pre-pay sim.  Given it costs about 10 pounds in the UK to do the same, this seems pricey.  Any suggestions for pre-pay sims (I don't need data, just text and phone).  In Vancouver.</p> 
2782	It is safe to travel in Israel and Palestine?	<p>I intend to travel around Israel and Palestine (excluding the Gaza Strip). When I tell people about this I am often greeted semi-shocked responses, people seem to think it is very unsafe and I am risking my life.</p>  <p>I on the other hand have been approaching the trip as if I am going to a first world nation, and although there is obviously some religious/political tension, I am going to be safe (or as safe as I would be in most western nations) and have a good time. Is this outlook naive?</p> 
6344	US to Asia via Europe with infants	<p>We are planning to go on a trans-atlantic flight (> 10 hrs) with an infant. To help defray costs, we're considering just getting a "lap" ticket for our (would-be) 1 year old. </p>  <p>Are there airlines which are particularly good at accommodating infants? I would think these are the criteria:</p>  <ol> <li>Shortest layovers.</li> <li>Most legroom in Economy.</li> <li>Accommodating, in terms of infant engagement (toys, puzzles, etc.) during the flight, seat assignments with bassinets capabilities, etc.</li> </ol>  <p>Our Route Sector will be to fly east from the US east coast (NY or DC), via Europe, to China/India. The final destination will be contingent based on scheduling, pricing and the answer to this question ;)</p> 
5845	Knock-on of different airline flight being cancelled on same booking	<p>I'm eyeying up a flight booking.</p>  <p>First from Auckland (AKL) to Sydney (SYD) with LAN Chile.</p>  <p>Then 3 hours later, from Sydney to Vancouver (YVR) with Air Canada.</p>  <p>However, LAN has a poor rating for timeliness on that route.  </p>  <p>I'm making this booking as a single booking through Orbitz.com.  If the LAN one is late arriving, am I held accountable for missing the 2nd flight?  And as a backup, if I have travel insurance, would that cover the missed flight if the airline didn't?</p> 
17382	Is layover time of 1hr and 5 min enough at Vienna International Airport to catch the next connecting flight?	<p>I am travelling to San Francisco, and my itinerary has two layovers, first leg of the journey is from DEL(Delhi) to Vienna (layover 1 hour 5 min) the second leg is from Vienna to Frankfurt (layover 1 hour 20 min) and final flight from FRA to SFO.</p>  <p>I am panicking over the fact that if a layover of 1hour 5min and 1 hour 20 min respectively would be enough for me to make my connection flights.</p>  <p>Please let me know if I should take the risk or cancel and reschedule my flight.</p>  <p>Edit- My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport. <strong>Also I do not have to collect the luggage as the entire journey is via Lufthansa.</strong></p> 
12762	Do I need an airport transit visa for Germany if I have a Schengen visa?	<p>I am an Indian citizen living in the US. I am going back to India to get a H1B visa stamped. I have established that I would require an airport transit visa when I have a stopover in Germany.</p>  <p>On the way to India, I plan to visit a friend in Italy for a couple of days. For this, I will be applying for a Schengen tourist visa. My itinerary stops in Frankfurt both on the way to Milan and while heading to India from Milan. </p>  <p>Would I still require an airport transit visa despite having a Schengen visa?</p> 
10239	Can tourists meet onsen geisha nowadays?	<p>Japan's most famous geisha are from Kyoto, Japan's former capital and still a major cultural capital of Japan. But I've also heard of onsen geisha, far away from the big cities, who are at the bottom of the pecking order of geisha.</p>  <p>Do such geisha still exist nowadays? Geisha have become much smaller in number over time, and I'm wondering if onsen geisha were the first to disappear. Is it possible to see, or better yet socialize, with onsen geisha nowadays?</p>  <p>Are most geisha who perform in onsen towns necessarily "onsen geisha"? When searching for onsen geisha, I often got hits for "[location] onsen geisha", such as <a href="http://www.go-nagano.net/blog/?p=5407">One of Nagano’s “Treasures” — The Togura Kamiyamada Onsen Geisha</a>.</p>  <p>How do onsen geisha differ from their big city counterparts? I assume that they are less expensive, but apart from that, do they tend to have a different persona? Are the geisha games available different?</p> 
17362	How should I wash clothes in Japan?	<p>I'm going backpacking for a month in Japan and I plan to pack lightly. So I have couple of questions about how I can wash my clothes in Japan. </p>  <p>I expect laundromats to be quite common in big cities but what about little towns in rural area (for example, Hokkaido)?</p>  <p>I'm used to washing my clothes in hot water, but I've read that clothes are washed in cold water in Japan. How different is from what I'm used to? Do I have to use different detergents and/or in a different way?</p>  <hr>  <p>I asked couple of questions here but since they are all pretty much related to the same topic I don't think it would be useful splitting this question.</p> 
13828	Transfers between Paris and its airports	<p>Paris has 3 airports (Orly, Roissy, Beauvais), what are the options to go to or to come from there?</p>  <p>(There is also Vatry (XCR) but there is very few flights and i see the shuttle system is currently off.)</p> 
1668	Getting from downtown Vancouver to the Airport on a Friday night	<p>Later this year I'm going to be at a conference in Vancouver, and potentially I'll need to make a quick getaway to the airport on a Friday night once it finishes.</p>  <p>I've had a look on the <a href="http://tripplanning.translink.ca/" rel="nofollow">TransLink Trip Planner</a>, and it suggests that I take a bus to the nearest SkyTrain stop on the Canada Line, and then take that to the airport. In theory it should be about 40 minutes from the hotel to the airport. This would seem to be the best way to do the trip, quick and much cheaper than a taxi.</p>  <p>What I'm slightly worried about is that on a Friday night, the bus along West Georgia Street (from the hotel to the SkyTrain) may be late/full/etc, or there may be problems with the SkyTrain itself. Should I generally be fine trusting the trip planner timings, I do I need to allow longer for a Friday night? </p> 
17442	Transfer from Paris CDG to ORY	<p>I'll be landing at Roissy (Charles de Gaulle) airport in Paris at 9:40 tomorrow (a Saturday) and leaving on another flight from Orly at 13:35 (latest check-in 13:15). That gives about 3.5 hours, including getting off the plane, collecting bags, getting out of the airport, delays, and so on.</p>  <p>What are my options for transferring between airports?</p>  <p>How long do they take and how much do they cost?</p>  <p>Do you think there's enough time to pop out somewhere in the city for a quick coffee and baguette or to sit in a park? Where?</p> 
3620	Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month	<p>I would like to visit a few places in the states sometime next year, and I was thinking of doing a road trip while I'm at it. I could start in either Los Angeles or Montreal, and then I would like to visit Philadelphia, Phoenix and Las Vegas during my trip; plus whatever there is on the way between - national parks would be on top of the list. I had about $2000 in mind for transport (excluding fuel).</p>  <p>So my question is: how would I get around? I could take the trains or public transport between the States and Montreal because I don't want to have any hassle with importing/exporting a car, and only drive a car in the states. </p>  <p>The 2 options I see here are either buying a used car and then sell it at the end of the trip, or rent a car. </p>  <p>I had a look at hertz.com, and they quoted me ~$3500 (including insurance) for 1 month and this car: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/01dmk.jpg" alt="look mate, the orange car goes much faster!"></p>  <p>But it seems like I have to return the car to the pickup location with Hertz, because if I choose a different drop off location it shows "not available" for this car. Did I just pick the wrong drop off location here of is A->B really not an option? Do I get different rates at different locations? Has anyone advice on how to get this cheaper? I searched for "relocation" on their site, but didn't find anything.</p>  <p>The second option would be to buy a car for $3000, and then sell it at the end of my trip, and hopefully get more than $1000 back for it. Has anyone experience with this? Are there any places better for buying or for selling a car? In which state would I get "more car" for the same amount of money? Would there be any paperwork involved if I buy a car in one state and sell it in another? Anything else I need to know when buying or selling a car?</p> 
2805	Is the TSA Lock acceptable in European Airports?	<p>I understand if you travelling in or to the US, you can lock your luggage using the TSA Luggage Lock. (Immigration is still able to open your luggage using their own special keys)</p>  <p>How about Europe? Especially Heathrow + Charles de Gaulle?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tqiLt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>If the TSA Lock is not acceptable in Europe, are there any other alternative precautions I could use instead?</p>  <p>(FYI, information about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration#Luggage_locks">TSA Lugguage Locks</a>)</p> 
14815	Applying for Schengen Visa in Seattle?	<p>Has anyone applied for Schengen tourist visa from Seattle? I don't want to travel to SFO to apply for the visa.

5809	The most difficult countries to travel in?	<p>Now at first sight that's a subjective question.  But I'll explain now that it's not.  So please don't answer subjectively either!</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aTransport-dush-khorog.jpg"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DJ73e.jpg" alt="Pamir Highway between Dushanbe and Khorog, Tajikistan"></a></p>  <p><em>Pamir Highway between Dushanbe and Khorog, Tajikistan</em></p>  <p>When papers or publications release pieces about "the richest country" it's usually based on something - maybe GDP, or debt, for example.</p>  <p><a href="http://hitchwiki.org/">Hitch Wiki</a> gives each country a 'hitchability' rating, for example.  But that's only one form of travel, and there's not much granularity in the rating system.</p>  <p><a href="http://meandmychucks.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/which-kind-of-traveler-are-you/"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3UcEE.jpg" alt="generic hitching picture"></a></p>  <p><em>generic hitching picture</em></p>  <p>Is there a publication or source that through some moderately scientific calculation, publishes a list of the hardest (or easiest) countries to travel through?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ssqq.com/archive/vinlin27b.htm"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IK9zE.jpg" alt="Yungas Road or &quot;Death Road&quot; in Bolivia"></a></p>  <p><em>Yungas Road or "Death Road" in Bolivia</em></p>  <p>I'm not sure myself how you would measure this - but similarly, I'm not sure how you'd compare crime stats between countries. Yet news outlets, universities etc have found a way, with many studies. I'm expecting someone's come up with a 'scientific' way to do it, and I'm looking for that.</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
7775	Is 50 minutes enough time to transfer between Terminal A and C at Newark (EWR)?	<p>We'll be arriving at Newark airport (with two kids under 7) at Terminal A and our flight connection is in Terminal C. Is that enough time to catch the connecting flight?</p>  <p>Update: both flights are on United.</p> 
270	What rights do passengers have when flights in the USA are delayed?	<p>What rights do passengers on delayed flights in the USA have? In some countries, depending on the length and type of delay, passengers can receive a free phone call, meal ticket, lodging, booking on alternate carriers etc. Are there any rules in the USA or is it up to the airline to determine the policy? Also, does the kind of delay matter, for example weather delay, mechanical delay, air traffic delay etc.</p>  <p>I'm curious because a recent 1 hour weather delay on a short domestic flight meant that I was unable to make an international connection. Since that particular international flight only runs once on day, the 1 hour weather delay turned into a 24 hour delay. In my case, I didn't mind departing a day later, but I'm pretty sure that there were routes on other airlines that would have arrived at around the same time. Would I have any right to ask to be switched to those other airlines? Would it make a difference if it was a mechanical delay instead of a weather delay (ie. the airlines fault)?</p> 
2312	What happens if you miss a connecting flight?	<p>What happens if you book tickets through an airline or travel agent, but on the travel date miss a connecting flight (either because the first flight was delayed, or because immigration/security took too long at the connecting airport)? Will you be put on the next flight for free? Are you expected to pay for a new ticket or a change fee? I'm specifically wondering about Continental/United, but also curious about airlines in general.</p> 
1153	Which Australian bank/account incurs lowest fees using an ATM card overseas?	<p>As per <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1011/us-debit-atm-card-with-lowest-fees-for-travel">this question about US banks</a>, I would like to know if any Australian bank offers an account with an ATM card (or Visa/Mastercard debit card) with no or low fees for travellers using them in foreign cash machines.</p>  <p>This includes whether certain Australian banks have deals with certain other banks in other countries where fees are waived/reduced.</p>  <p>My current bank account seems to have too many and too high fees when I'm travelling. If there's a better one I may change banks when I get home.</p> 
13900	Best way from Central Rotterdam to Europoort	<p>I'm going to a conference in Rotterdam (Maassilo, Maashaven Zuidzijde 1-2) next week (friday) and need to get to the Europoort for my ferry home straight afterwards. </p>  <p>I've booked a seat on the bus from the central train station, but it leaves before the conference finishes which means I'll have miss the end in order to get home.</p>  <p>A taxi would be about €90 which is a way too much for me, and I can't seem to find another route (bus, metro, etc). </p>  <p>So, does anyone have any advice on how I can stay for the end of my conference (17:00), and maybe a few drinks after, but still make my 19:30 (latest) checking? </p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I've accepted Bart's answer as correct because there doesn't seem to be any cheap and fast route from Maashaven to Europoort. I had to leave the conference early to make it to the coach laid on by P&amp;O. I'll update this question again if I go back and figure something better out.</p> 
4675	3 days in London. What do I absolutely have to see?	<p>In a few weeks I will be in London for the first time for 3 days to take care of some business. I thought I could take advantage of the situation and do some sightseeing.</p>  <p>What are the places I must absolutely visit? So far I got the Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. Also, what are some good places to go out and have some fun in the night?</p>  <p>EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. London is a wonderful place, and your answers allowed me to have a very good time there.</p>  <p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned, if you are looking for pubs go to Clapham Common. Had a blast there.</p> 
7658	4 days in Paris	<p>I am leaving on friday for a city trip to Paris, arriving at noon. I am already leaving Paris again at monday evening at 5 o'clock. </p>  <p>I really want to see the Louvre, Versailles and the Eiffel Tower and I want to take a French breakfast at a local café, preferably not there where all the tourists are. </p>  <p>How much Paris can I cram into these 4 days? Where do I need to visit and, more importantly, in which order do I need to visit the local sights?</p>  <p>I am a student, and my budget is at around 200 euros. </p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
10553	How to travel (relatively) cheaply by ICE trains in Germany?	<p>When I first checked prices for ICE trains in Germany, I was a bit shocked by prices of over 100 Euros (in Poland not long ago the trains were the cheapest way of public transport). </p>  <p>But then I found out that there are some promotions such as <a href="http://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/ueberblick/bahncard25.shtml?dbkanal_003=L01_S01_D001_KAF0001_affilinet-3101-BahnCard25-148420_LZ01" rel="nofollow">BahnCard 25</a> and it's possible to travel cheaply if you <a href="http://www.spartipp.de/reise/bahn/29-euro-bahn-fahrkarten-fuer-ic-und-ice-deutschlandweit.html" rel="nofollow">book the ICE in advance</a> (something similar to a plane).</p>  <p>But how is it in practice with these promotions? How to use them to really save money, for example, when someone wants to do a round trip once a month?</p> 
16674	Where can I find the restrictions and easements that apply to a given UK Rail Ticket?	<p>UK rail ticketing isn't always the simplest thing in the world, but the basics aren't too hard to learn. There are <a href="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Train-times-and-tickets/Ticket-types">broadly</a> tickets valid at any time of the day, those available only outside of peak hours (typically after 9 and perhaps not in the evening rush hour), tickets only available at quiet times, tickets valid only on one train. These are mostly, but not always, valid in flavours of single (one way), day return (out and back the same day-ish), and (period) return (out on a given day, back within a month). That's it broadly, but you'll notice there's a bit of variation in even just those...</p>  <p>Next up, there are rules on what sort of route you can take. These largely revolve around <a href="http://www.atoc.org/about-atoc/rail-settlement-plan/routeing-guide">routing points</a>, not doubling back, direct trains normally being fine, and not taking too long a route if there's a choice. (There's a whole art to making the most of that though, but this isn't the question for that!)</p>  <p>On top of all that, certain routes and/or stations will have additional restrictions, or easements where default restrictions are lifted. For example, one station might be in an area where the default rule is "off peak tickets valid after 9am", then has an additional restriction "off peak tickets to London only valid on trains arriving after 10am", and an easement "off peak tickets to stations along the <em>insert line name here</em> valid after 08:45".</p>  <p>By looking up these restrictions and easements, it's sometimes possible to save money on your journey. In the example above, you might assume you'd need a peak time ticket to travel on the 08:54 to a station along the local branch line, but the easement actually allows you to travel on a cheaper off-peak ticket instead.</p>  <p>How do you go about looking up what easements apply to a given ticket for a journey, and equally what extra restrictions (eg evening peak times or not-valid-via) apply?</p> 
3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
5599	OK we're all nerds here, so really, how on earth should I use a Japanese toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone who's traveled to Japan you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>They're devices that are a textbook example of excessive featuritis.</p>  <p>But I want to use something other than the flush knob before leaving Japan. What is a feature that has the following characteristics:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Common to most Japanese toilets.</p></li> <li><p>Hard to get wrong - won't create a mess or damage the toilet.</p></li> <li><p>Simple to comprehend - more likely to involve romaji or kana or simple kanji or pictures.</p></li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UbP9I.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
8944	How on earth can I use a Canadian toilet without splashing myself?	<p>The last few days I had to use Canadian toilets. Now I'm from Europe and I'm used to Central European toilets:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ujv4d.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>As you can see, the water is really far down the toilet and if "things" fall in there, you won't get splashed. On the other hand, toilets in Canada look more like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WtN1w.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>As you can see, there is quite a huge flat area in the toilet that is normally full of water. So every time I take a dump I splash myself with water.</p>  <p>Seriously, how can I avoid that?</p> 
11701	What happens if you lose your passport at an airport / during transit?	<p>Once, when flying from India to the UK, I left my passport on the plane's seat-back pocket and forgot that I left it there until I reached the passport control desks. Fortunately in this case, I rushed back to the gate where the plane had parked and since the plane was being cleaned there, I was able to request the staff to fetch my passport for me from my seat.</p>  <p>My question is: <strong>what happens if you lose your passport during transit at an airport, or before you reach the passport control desk at your destination country?</strong> I know that in any other situation, I would be able to contact my country's embassy to get an emergency travel document (ETD). What happens in this other case - can you get an ETD at the airport, or will you be deported back to the country you flew from? And in case of a deportation, are you sent back to your home country or the origin country of your previous flight? I want to know if there are any international laws covering this scenario.</p>  <p>(This is all under the assumption that you have the relevant visas or travel authorisation for your destination, but they're obviously in your passport.)</p> 
100	How should I deal with beggars in India?	<p>I heard that it is unsafe to show money or help someone in India.</p>  <p>Are there any rules I should respect to avoid getting into trouble?  How should I deal with these beggars?</p> 
14489	Getting to Petra from Amman in Jordan	<p>Let's say I fly into Queen Alia International Airport / Amman in Jordan. How would I get to Petra without renting a car?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.jett.com.jo/SubPage.aspx?PageId=230" rel="nofollow">Apparently there's a bus</a> that'll take me from Abdali to Petra. Where's Abdali? wikipedia.org suggests that Abdali is, among other things, "Abdali Urban Regeneration Project, district in Amman, Jordan". That's nice, but saying the bus departs from there is about as useful as saying "we have a bus stop in Jordan; find it". Abdali is presumably a large district and scouring the whole district for one bus stop...  seems like a bit of a waste of time.</p>  <p>Maybe I could <a href="http://www.viajordan.com/extra_pages.php?page_name=Petra%20from%20Amman&amp;page_id=189" rel="nofollow">use a service like this</a> but it's not clear to me how that'd work. Do I just pick up a hotel and they'll pick me up from it? Do they pick the hotel? And if they're providing the food what kind of food do they have?</p> 
5633	Is it possible to carry pepper spray for self-defense?	<p>I want to carry pepper spray with me when traveling for self-defense purposes only. Is there a way to be allowed to do that or is there any official document that allows me to safely travel with pepper spray? Also wanted to know whether this is allowed through airport security in cabin/checked luggage.</p>  <p>Currently the countries I am interested in are Israel, Prague and Estonia.</p> 
17792	Is it possible to obtain a visa to Brazil without entry ticket?	<p>I have plans to meet a friend in Paris mid-September. Before that I will be visiting Brazil.  Therefore, I am considering buying a flight Brazil to France.  This should satisfy the proof-of-onward-travel requirement for my Brazilian visa.</p>  <p>However, before visiting Brazil, I will be spending some time in Mexico, and possibly Peru.  This means I don't yet know if I'll be flying to Brazil from Peru or Mexico, and I don't yet know which date I will be entering Brazil.</p>  <p>Is it possible, as a US citizen, to obtain my tourist visa to Brazil with only a departure date/ticket?  If not, can I purchase a (cheap) entry ticket into Brazil for an early date, will I be permitted entry if I enter on a later date?</p> 
17647	Do U.S. citizens have to get a Brazilian visa before leaving the country?	<p>Or can I pick it up in another country among my travels? I'm planning a 6-month trip through South America and am wondering if I can go to the Brazilian consulate in Colombia on my way to Brazil instead of getting it now. One of the requirements of getting the visa is to have an itinerary that shows how you're going into and out of the Brazil. I don't have it at the moment and I'm planning on figuring it out when I get down there. </p>  <p>Any ideas? </p> 
802	Are there any ferry companies operating between Russian East ports and Japan?	<p>I'm interested in visiting the Japan after some Russian Far East trip.<br> I'm searching for the sea ways to the Japan. Can you help me with that?</p>  <hr>  <p>Update: I'm searching some extremal variants not from Vladivostok</p> 
16846	What is cheapest phone option for a short trip to Europe?	<p>I'm leaving for Europe in a couple days. I'm spending a few days in England and then a few days in Hungary before returning to the US. Unfortunately, I have not given much thought to my phone/internet options until now.</p>  <p>Anticipated needs: </p>  <ul> <li><p>5-10 phone calls total, all in-country, with no more than 60 minutes total talk time;</p></li> <li><p>30-50 text messages total, all in-country;</p></li> <li><p>light Web browsing, with a conservative (high) estimate of 75MB/day for data use.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I have a Verizon iPhone 5 and am willing to take it to use with a different SIM or, if I must, to use as-is with Verizon's "Global Services" rates. For reference, the latter are the same for both England and Hungary: $1.29/minute for voice, $0.50/$0.05 to send/receive texts, and $0.25/MB for data.</p>  <p>What is my best option? Best means both cheap/convenient, but weighted mainly toward cheap.</p>  <p>Happy to elaborate if more info needed.</p> 
17537	What is the cheapest way for intercity travel from Belgium (Brussels) to other countries and nearby?	<p>I am here in Leuven on an internship and only have weekends when I can travel and see places around. So I plan to go to important cities, so it would more of intercity travel(let us say from Leuven/Brussels to some city where I want to go, and back to Leuven/Brussels) rather than travel within the country. Are there any passes/discounts available for such kind of travel?</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>By important cities I mean visit destinations like Paris. So once in Paris, I will stay there for 2 days and then come back to Leuven. There will not be much of travel inside France as I will spend my time in Paris.</p> 
862	What is the minimum passport expiry period when travelling to USA on an ESTA authorization from a previous visit?	<p>I've heard that when travelling to the USA your passport must not expire within 6 months of travelling. Is this the case if you have a valid ESTA visa waiver program authorization from a previous visit? I visited the USA last year under the visa waiver program but now that I've run out of Reese's Pieces I'm coming back for more! I'm travelling in September but my passport expires in November. My ESTA autorisation from last year is valid until the date of my passport expiry.</p>  <p>I can't say that I've noticed anything on the ESTA website about passports not expiring within 6 months but after a 12 hour flight I don't want to leave anything to chance.</p> 
9747	Baggage allowance of separate domestic flights with a connecting international flight?	<p>In the US, is there such a rule so that, if you are taking a domestic flight and then taking an international flight, the luggage allowance of the international flight will apply? Because it is quite possible you are taking a flight from a small airport to a big airport, and then catch your international flight.</p>  <p>Do all Airlines have the same regulations? Is there such a rule imposed by the government?</p> 
12936	Ski Resorts during the Northern Hemisphere's Summer	<p>I am wondering what Ski Resorts are available (open) for skiing during the Northern Hemisphere's summer?</p>  <p>Level of comfort and amenities don't really make a difference for the purposes of this question.</p> 
5687	Can I carry on/check in a child's car seat for free for a flight?	<p>I am not flying with my child. Instead, I will meet my child at the destination of my flight. I have a small backpack and one carry-on bag, which is free for most airlines. Can I carry on additionally a child's car seat? In fact, it is a booster seat. It will not be used during the flight, but will be used in a rental car in the destination city.</p>  <p>To be more specific, I will fly with Delta and JetBlue this time. If checking in the booster seat would be free, that should be the best solution for me. Can I?</p> 
7165	Why is TAM Airlines baggage allowance so much?	<p>I travel around Europe, and also between Australia and Europe quite a bit and am always frustrated with the low luggage allowance (just 23kg per person normally).</p>  <p>I do also travel to Brazil quite a bit and TAM Airlines have a baggage allowance of 2 x 32kg each (64kg!!).  </p>  <p>Why do they offer such a large baggage allowance when so many other airlines can't?</p>  <p>It seems they also offer it only from London and Frankfurt to Brazil - why is this?</p>  <p>My fiance is Brazilian - and believe me when I say - needs the 64kg for all the clothes and shoes we normally take over there.  I'm just wondering why it seems to be just TAM offering this.</p> 
10190	What are the choices of cost-effective Lounges at European Airports?	<p>Assume Mathew's earnings per year are more than 30,000 euros. He pays now for lounges: about 30 euros for one visit. So he pays now about 500 euros every year for lounges. He needs to travel only between Tallinn, Oslo and Helsinki.</p>  <p><strong>Are there any cheaper methods to stay in lounges like by some bonus programs or Credit cards?</strong></p>  <p>I am now thinking about a Diners Club International credit card, but I am not sure whether it is the best solution for my situation.</p> 
11594	Is there a ZIP code I can enter when paying-at-the-pump in the USA with a foreign credit card?	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kQL2im.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>In the USA, many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_at_the_pump">pay-at-the-pump</a> fuel dispensers that accept credit cards require a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code">5-digit numeric zip code</a> that corresponds to the billing address of the credit card.  In Canada, for instance, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada">6-digit alphanumeric postal codes</a>, so it's not obvious what you're supposed to type in since the gas dispensers have only numeric keypads.  Entering '00000' or '90210' seems to always result in failed authorization.</p>  <p>Is there a zip code that works for credit cards with foreign billing addresses?</p> 
4632	How to deal with excess baggage?	<p>I might have some excess bagage on my next flight with KLM. According to KLM's website excess baggage could be checked in online with a 20% discount. </p>  <p>Are there other options? Long, long ago there was always the option of sea mail. This is no longer offered. </p>  <p>What are alternatives for sending excess bagage cheaper then taking it with me on the flight?</p> 
14751	Public transportation considerations for children in North Eastern USA	<p>My wife and I will be going to Fairfield, CT in April with our 2 kids (2yo and 9mo), we might be going to NYC for a day or two.</p>  <p>My question comes with public transportation and the kids, I know if they need to go in a car the need to be properly seated in child seats, which makes me believe getting cabs is going to be a pain.</p>  <p>But moreover, are there any special considerations to think off to go on a bus, subway or train with them?</p>  <p>So far all I've found that to go in the subway, if we have strollers we need to pick up the kids and close the strollers to go into the sub, does this also apply for the MTA that goes from Fairfield to Grand Central?</p>  <p>What do I need to take into account (public transport wise) when traveling with small children to the USA?</p> 
1651	Travel with a baby from Eindhoven to Maasbree in the Netherlands	<p>We are flying from London into <a href="http://www.eindhovenairport.com/">Eindhoven</a> in the Netherlands and then traveling to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasbree">Maasbree</a> (about 40 minutes by car) for the weekend. A friend has arranged for a taxi but we'll have a baby with us and we don't have a car seat. Are there taxis available with car seats? Is there other transport to consider? Would it be possible to borrow or hire a car seat either in the Netherlands or in London? Or is there a better solution?</p> 
17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p> 
18004	What is the fuel surcharge?	<p>Reading on the web about the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17993/how-does-fuel-dumping-work">"Fuel Dumping"</a> trick made me aware of the <em>fuel surcharge</em>, one of several <em>possible</em> charges being added to the base price of a flight. In order to understand the trick better, I would like to know:</p>  <p><em>What exactly is the fuel surcharge? Is it mandated by law? Is it just a trick that airlines use to keep the base price low?</em></p>  <p>The screenshot below shows details about what is added to the base price of a Lufthansa ticket DRS - MUC in June 2013. Note the <em>Fuel and Security Surcharge</em>.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qUb6f.png" alt="Example of taxes, fess &amp; carrier charges (per person)"></p> 
7836	Sporting activities in Goa	<p>Me along with my friends are planning to tour Goa on Sept 29-Oct2.</p>  <p>We are really interested in jet skiing, scuba diving, sailing and various such sporting activities.

14165	Where can I visit former Nazi camps and prisons in Europe?	<p>Some months ago I visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Documentation_Centre_of_the_City_of_Cologne">NS Documentation Center of the City of Cologne</a>. The museum was very interesting for me because the building wasn't destroyed during World War II and I could see the former Gestapo prison with inscriptions and drawings done by prisoners on the walls.  </p>  <p>Now I am looking for other museums in Europe dedicated to memorializing the victims of the Nazi regime like prisons and concentration camps where I can see more than just photos and videos, or some memorials built after the war. I want to see the death camps from inside, prison cells or gas chambers.</p> 
17993	How does "Fuel Dumping" work?	<p>Recently, I saw a lot of blog post, forum posts etc on Fuel Dumping. For me it seemed like you can book a flight with high fuel charges, and then add another unrelated leg to the flight that you not plan to use to get rid of the high fuel charges. However, I could not find any concrete explanation on how fuel dumping works.</p> 
5167	Any travel booking sites that let you search for a mixed itinerary?	<p>Travel sites that search all the major air lines are a dime a dozen.  And in some localities, there are travel sites that at least pay lip service to searching major bus carriers.</p>  <p>But are there any travel sites that will search all major forms of transportation, and let you form a mixed itinerary? I'm thinking at least air, bus, and train.</p>  <p>For instance, if I want the cheapest way to get from Town A to Town B, I'd like options like:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Take Foo Bus Line from Town A to City Q</li>   <li>Fly Bar Airline from City Q to City Z</li>   <li>Take Baz Passenger Train from City Z to Town B</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>For bonus points, it might even include public transit options, in localities where it's actually feasible to take public transit between major cities.</p>

4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
17969	When travelling internationally with valuable personal effects, how do I avoid paying duty at each border crossing?	<p>Some people travel internationally with valuable personal effects.  The most obvious example is photography equipment which could easily be valued over $15k.  Jewelry, watches, and specialized medical or sports equipment (think expensive bicycle) also seem likely expensive personal effects that people might travel with.</p>  <p>For most countries it seems that personal effects are not subject to duties (see also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/10934/3067">"Customs and Duties" of this answer</a>).  Of course, this depends on the customs official accepting your claim that the items you are importing are personal effects.  If a customs official rejects your claim that they are, in fact, personal effects, it seems clear that you would have to pay duty on the items.  While this seems uncommon, there are reasonably credible stories about travelers being charge import duties the personal items they are traveling with including <a href="http://photofocus.com/2010/07/29/u-s-based-photographers-traveling-abroad-beware-the-duty/">this one about photographers returning to the USA</a> and <a href="http://photo.net/travel-photography-forum/00XWYm">this one about a visitor to China's iPad</a>.</p>  <p>How do I avoid being charged duty on my valuable personal effects when I cross a border?</p>  <hr>  <p><em>This is probably <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11594/is-there-a-zip-code-i-can-enter-when-paying-at-the-pump-in-the-usa-with-a-foreig">one of those questions that will have a different answer for each country</a>, so I've left it country-agnostic.  <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/17970/3067">I've found the answer</a> for leaving and returning to the USA, but I really need an answer for traveling from Canada to Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, and back to Canada via Germany.</em></p>

3826	Best Time for Visiting the Curonian Spit	<p>I am interested in visiting the Curonian Spit, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/3804/766">possibly with a sidetrip to Kaliningrad</a>. Now I would like to know the best time of the year to do so. I would like to avoid the crowds of the high and peak seasons. On the other hand, I would like to avoid the dead season (if there is one) as well, when most of the restaurants, shops and attraction are likely to be closed. Also note that I do not care about temperature. </p>

2079	Geek stuff to do in Las Vegas	<p>Obviously, the Star Trek Experience <em>would have been</em> a good suggestion. But consider that I'm a science fiction geek, computer programmer, technologist, those kinds of things. What kind of cool stuff along those lines is there in Vegas?</p> 
1980	Las Vegas - What is good to do there?	<p>I've been told that unless you have a good plan for Las Vegas, you're not going to have a clue what to do when you get there.</p>  <p>I and my two brothers have a trip planned in October from the 2nd to the 16th. We're starting in Los Angeles and then driving to Vegas. We have things planned for Los Angeles so that part is fine. However, we're planning to stay longer in the Vegas area.</p>  <p>So far we have a single casino visit planned, tickets to see <em>Penn and Teller</em> and time at a gun range sorted. But we plan to be there from the 5th to the 14th so we need more to do.</p>  <p>This is a once in a lifetime trip for us and we don't want it to be too much of a tourist thing. We're looking to find some good places to head out and have fun. We're all in our twenties (24-28) and Irish, so somewhere we can get drunk would be great.</p>  <p>Top ideas or good tips for hanging out in Vegas would be greatly appreciated.</p> 
18211	Can I buy train tickets for a Shanghai - Beijing trip in Hong Kong?	<p>Background: I want to travel to Hong Kong - Shanghai - Beijing by train.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.seat61.com/China.htm" rel="nofollow">Seat61</a> article about train travel in China has details on fares, schedules and how to book the tickets.

Can anyone confirm if I can buy the tickets from the reservation office in Hong Kong?</p> 
14799	Traveling to tomorrow/yesterday	<p>This question always comes to my mind and I cannot find a logical answer to it. We all know that there are some hours differ in the time if we travel from east to west or from west to east.</p>  <p>Suppose I am now at one of the most western countries (like Hawai) where the time is 7 PM on Saturday and I travel to one of the most eastern countries (Like Newsland) where the time would be around 6 PM on Sunday, would it be considered as traveling to tomorrow?</p> 
5538	Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?	<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>  <p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p> 
14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days. I have already got visitor's visa for the same on my Indian passport. Particulars mentioned on my visa are:  1. 'Etats Schengen' , 2. Single entry 3. Dates of visit. &amp; 4. Type of visa : C.  I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p>

Will that give me enough time to take the express train into <strong>London (Paddington</strong>) for a short (say <strong>2 hour visit</strong>)? </p>  <p>I am mostly concerned with the return to terminal 5 and going through security (I will already have my boarding pass at that time).</p> 
10206	Travelling with a laptop	<p>What are some tips/suggestions for travelling with a laptop through a region like South East Asia? <strong>More specifically, Thailand / Laos / Malaysia.</strong> But again, also just looking for general tips/advice.</p>  <p>I've already got some bases covered as I'm using a MacBook Air so weight/size isn't too much of an issue, but what about stuff like:</p>  <ul> <li>General Security in not losing it</li> <li>Data Security - connecting to unsafe Wifi &amp; Using Proxy to be safe</li> <li>Backing up Computer Data - is just using a cloud service like DropBox the best or are there other tips?</li> </ul>  <p>I'm not an idiot and understand there are certain situations where I should keep the laptop hidden, but I'm really just looking for advice from someone has travelled a lot in a similar place with a laptop.</p> 
18265	Do I need a transit visa for Denmark in addition to my single entry Schengen area visa?	<p>I am a Chinese national holding a US greencard. I am planning on traveling to the UK and the Schengen area to visit France, Germany, and possibly some countries in between. I am applying for a UK visa and a single entry Schengen visa now. On my journey to the UK I am stopping in Copenhagen for a day. Do I need a transit visa for that? Should I apply for a multiple entry Schengen visa, or is that too much? My guess is a transit visa for Denmark and a separate single entry visa would be easier to apply for.</p> 
7807	Single vs. Multiple entry Schengen visa, for Spain and France?	<p>I am from Egypt and I'm planning a vacation to <strong>Spain and France</strong>. While filling the visa application, should I choose a single or a multiple entry visa?! If i got a single entry Schengen visa, I still can travel from Spain to France and then back to Spain as long as it is during the valid dates of my visa right?!</p>

981	What's the name for the "blocking" stickers used on car headlights?	<p>I'll be driving my car from Belgium to the UK, with plans to then drive around the country. </p>  <p>Like most cars in the European mainland, my car's headlights/headlamps are slightly adjusted to the right side of the road. When driving in the UK, though, this blinds oncoming traffic. That's why there's a type of sticker made to apply to headlights to prevent this problem, and why these stickers are required in the UK for right-hand drive cars.</p>  <p>When I lived in the Netherlands, you could buy them in almost any town. In Belgium, where I live now, few shops sell them.</p>  <p>I'm having trouble finding them, partly because I don't remember what they're actually called. Does anyone know the proper name of these "blocking" stickers so I can search for them on the Internet?</p> 
12787	Finding flights to Cuba with a flight search engine	<p>Several of the main flight search tools (Kayak, matrix.itasoftware.com) and the like either won't show or tell you they can't show flights to Cuba due to legal reasons and them being American websites.</p>  <p>Is there a search tool that will? I realise I could go to LAN or Copa or other airline's individual websites, but I'd rather there be an easier way to find flights from, say, DFW to HAV (yes I realise it'd most likely have to go  through another country first).</p> 
17523	Where can I get the required permits for Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu?	<p>I've heard that I should buy a permit to visit Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu. Where can I get them? (I've emailed to mtsobek.com travel agency, but there is no response from them). So if there is no way to do it by yourself (online?) then could you recommend any travel agency which may buy the permits on my behalf?</p> 
16068	Can I take my bicycle into all German trains?	<p>I want to take a train with my bicycle from somewhere in Germany to Switzerland. Concerning this, I have a couple of question that all go to the same direction:</p>  <p>Can I take my bike in every train? Or do I have to take a special train? How do I know if I can take a bike with me? Do I need a reservation for my bike?</p>  <p>In Switzerland, there is also a service where you can drop off a bike at almost any train station and the pick it up at any other destination for a very low fee (around 5-10 CHF), is there something similar for trains from Germany to Switzerland?</p> 
3960	Is there any way to spend a night in a European castle?	<p>I spent a night in a jail converted to a hotel in Switzerland, and it made me wonder if there is a real castle converted to an hotel in Europe.</p>  <p>And with "real" I mean the castle should have a historical past, and NOT a castle built recently or a hotel with a 'castle' look on the outside but on the inside it looks like a common hotel.</p>  <p>In short, I want to feel that I was brought back to the castle age if I stay in the hotel.</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
5800	Driving license in Australia	<p>We will be in Australia for a few days and I was considering renting a car. Is a standard European license (we have Polish and Italian) good enough, or do we need "international driving license"? We live in London, so getting the latter one is a major obstacle.</p> 
18394	If, like Edward Snowden, your passport was revoked or cancelled, how could you travel?	<p>As per the news, NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden has had his passport revoked by the United States Government.  </p>  <p>From the article:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It was not immediately clear how Snowden was able to travel,</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, he was able to fly from Hong Kong to Russia, and apparently plans to continue on to Latin America / Cuba.  </p>  <p><strong>With a revoked passport, how is one legally able to travel internationally??</strong></p> 
9654	Are there any "Fantasy Passports" that are recognised by other countries?	<p>I've read about the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/4066/101">Conch Republic</a> passports, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Hutt_River" rel="nofollow">Hutt River</a>, and am wondering - these so-called fantasy passports - are any of them actually recognised anywhere else in the world?</p>  <p>@mindcorrosive also pointed out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Passport" rel="nofollow">World Passport</a> which the EU declared to be a 'fantasy passport'.</p>  <p>According <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage_passport#Legality_of_camouflage_passports" rel="nofollow">to Wikipedia</a>: the legality is one thing - they're legal to posess in NZ and the EU, for example, but the section on effectiveness is empty... :(</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
9876	My ESTA is expiring - how does one go about renewing it?	<p>I got an email from the Department of Homeland Security(!) to say my two-year ESTA is expiring at the end of next month.  Is there a way to just renew it, or do you have to go through the complete application process again?</p>  <p>Also, do you need to wait for it to expire before applying?</p> 
18028	What happens if my ESTA expires on the day of arrival?	<p>I'm French and will travel the 14th of June to the US. My ESTA expires the 14th of  June 2013 and I'm wondering if my ESTA will be valid when I'll land in the US on the 14th of June 2013.</p>  <p>Does someone know anything about that?</p> 
14051	VWP question regarding re entry	<p>I entered the USA on a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) on 1 July 2012 and stayed until 16 Sep 2012 (78 days).  On what date in 2013 will I be able to travel to USA again under VWP?</p> 
13900	Best way from Central Rotterdam to Europoort	<p>I'm going to a conference in Rotterdam (Maassilo, Maashaven Zuidzijde 1-2) next week (friday) and need to get to the Europoort for my ferry home straight afterwards. </p>  <p>I've booked a seat on the bus from the central train station, but it leaves before the conference finishes which means I'll have miss the end in order to get home.</p>  <p>A taxi would be about €90 which is a way too much for me, and I can't seem to find another route (bus, metro, etc). </p>  <p>So, does anyone have any advice on how I can stay for the end of my conference (17:00), and maybe a few drinks after, but still make my 19:30 (latest) checking? </p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: I've accepted Bart's answer as correct because there doesn't seem to be any cheap and fast route from Maashaven to Europoort. I had to leave the conference early to make it to the coach laid on by P&amp;O. I'll update this question again if I go back and figure something better out.</p> 
17580	Other public transport from Rotterdam Central Station to Europort	<p>"Other public transport is possible, but will take you 3.5 hours". Bart Arondson mentioned this possibility for getting from Rotterdam Central to the Europort on 24th February <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13900/best-way-from-central-rotterdam-to-europoort/13903#13903">as an answer to a previous question</a>. Does anybody know what other possibility he meant? We need to travel with a small dog in the pet carrier and P&amp;O Shuttle bus doesn´t allow any pets. Normal taxi for two of us would be too expensive. Could you advice us please? We have plenty of time to get there, so we don´t mind if it takes a bit longer.</p> 
12766	Why is public transport from/to the airport so expensive?	<p>In the different places in the world, I always have the feeling that public transport from/to the airport is really expensive for what you actually get.</p>  <p>Here are a few prices for a couple of airport and additional information to be able to compare (I wanted to create a nice table but didn't find how to do it) :</p>  <ol> <li><p>Sydney Domestic Airport Station</p>  <ul> <li>15.90 AUD one way using <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/price.php">Airport Link</a></li> <li>6.3 km to Sydney Central Station by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> <li>Sydney Central to Ashfield seems to be the same distance and costs 3.60 AUD (8.4 km) using <a href="http://www.131500.com.au/tickets/fares/fares#mytrain">the train</a></li> </ul></li> <li><p>Sydney International Airport Station</p>  <ul> <li>16.70 AUD one way using <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/price.php">Airport Link</a></li> <li>9.2 km to Sydney Central Station by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> <li>Sydney Central to Croydon seems to be the same distance and costs 3.60 AUD (9.44 km) using <a href="http://www.131500.com.au/tickets/fares/fares#mytrain">the train</a></li> </ul></li> <li><p>Melbourne Tullamarine Airport</p>  <ul> <li>17 AUD one way, $28 return using <a href="http://melbourneairport.com.au/To-From-the-Airport/Skybus/Overview.html">SkyBus</a></li> <li>24 km to Melbourne Southern Cross Station by car (from <a href="http://melbourneairport.com.au/To-From-the-Airport/Skybus/Overview.html">Google Maps</a>)</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Paris Charles-De Gaulle</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/fr-FR/Passagers/Acces-Plans-Parking/Paris-CDG/Acces/Transports-En-Commun/Paris-Charles-Gaulle-Transports-Commun.htm">Depending on the transport</a> : 9.25 EUR (RER) ; 10 EUR (Roissybus)</li> <li>30 km to Chatelet les Halles by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Paris Orly</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/fr-FR/Passagers/Acces-Plans-Parking/Paris-Orly/Acces/Transports-En-Commun/paris-orly-transports-en-commun.htm">Depending on the transport</a> : 6.50 EUR (RER+BUS) ; 10.90 EUR (Orlyval), 7 EUR (Orlybus)</li> <li>17 km to Chatelet les Halles by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> <li>Chatelet les Halles to Villeneuve-Saint Georges seems to be the same distance and costs 4.10 EUR using <a href="http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/c_20585/titres-tarifs/">the RER</a></li> </ul></li> <li><p>London Gatwick</p>  <ul> <li>19.90 GBP using <a href="http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/">Gatwick Express</a>, a bit cheaper using other slower rail companies</li> <li>43km to London Victoria  by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Why is the price so high ? If there's something which is to be paid to the airport when going there, why isn't it included in the airport taxes on the flight ticket prices?</p>  <p>I find the even weirder when it makes the cab/taxi, despite its price being increased too, cheaper than the train/bus/shuttle for a couple of passengers.</p>  <p>Also, as an additional question, is this price difference higher/lower in different part of the world ?</p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p> 
6058	Is there a website dedicated to odd hotels?	<p>There is a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2008-12-29-747-jumbo-hostel_N.htm" rel="nofollow">boeing 747 hotel</a> in Sweden. Is there a search engine or any other way to find similar odd hotels per destination?</p> 
9658	Places with unusual platform numbers	<p>I just came across platform zero at JR Kyoto station. Are there places with more exotic station numbers, such as negative numbers, fractions or complex numbers? I'm interested in places that have such numbers as a joke, and places that have it for a serious reason.</p> 
8368	Is there an aircraft hostel in Canada or USA?	<p>Today we talked about hostels in funny locations, e.g. old prisons. Since I'm going to Canada and USA very soon, I would really like to spend some nights in an old aircraft that is now a hostel. Is there anything like that?</p> 
11259	How does one get to Lake Vivi, at the geographical center in Russia?	<p>In 2008 I went to Novosibirsk, Russia, for a solar eclipse. We were told at the time that The Chapel of Nikolai the Miracle Maker in town marks the geographical center of Russia.<br> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ssZdL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br> I also went back in 2011 on a trip across Russia on the train. Myth or out of date or whatever, it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_centre_of_the_Russian_Federation">apparently not true</a>, and there's a monument on the shore of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vivi">Lake Vivi</a> indicating the true spot.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HHI7D.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>However, my interest now piqued, I can't find if it's even possible to visit this spot.  It seems fairly far north of the standard train lines.  Can one visit, or would it require a more substantial expedition to venture out into this region of Russia?</p> 
18522	Is there any good way to know if a water-mass is safe to bathe in?	<p>There is a lot of pollution around, and a lot of abuses of the natural resources.  For example, on I-80 in Nevada, it is not uncommon to see some sort of man-made factories around what appears to be natural hot-springs (what do they usually do?), plus there's also always a danger of natural pathogens like E. coli.</p>  <p>Is there any good way to determine if a given body of water (lake, salt lake, hot spring) is safe to submerge oneself into?</p> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm. I'm an Indian national and have a valid US visa.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay airside?</p>  <p>I have been scared that British Airways have stopped a few people from boarding flights (no details just rumors).</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay landside? I want to do some sightseeing. What are the chances of getting past officials using transit without visa concession?</p>  <p>Real stories will help a lot to calm the butterflies in my stomach.</p>

18526	Edward Snowden has been in 'transit' in Moscow for days now. What's the longest possible you can just stay in a terminal?	<p>If Putin and others are to be believed, Edward Snowden has been airside in transit in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for close on a week now.  Is there an international 'record' that anyone's done not being 'in a country' - but just airside in a terminal?</p>  <p>(The Tom Hank movie comes to mind, but I've no idea how much of that was accurate)</p> 
16040	Are laws about sex outside marriage less rigorously enforced in Dubai for people on layovers?	<p>Last night, I read on the news that Qantas was switching its main hub from Singapore to Dubai.</p>  <p>Smart Traveller <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/United_Arab_Emirates">notes</a> about the United Arab Emirates:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Homosexual acts and sex outside of marriage: Homosexual acts and all   kinds of sex outside of marriage are illegal and may lead to severe   punishment, including imprisonment and fines. Foreigners have been   imprisoned for having sex with people to whom they are not legally   married. De facto relationships and civil unions are not recognised in   the UAE and any sexual acts within these relationships are considered   to be sex outside of marriage. It is also against the law in the UAE   to live together or share the same hotel room with someone of the   opposite sex to whom you are not married or closely related. If   checking into a hotel as a couple, you may be asked by management to   prove that you are legally married. These laws apply equally to UAE   residents as well as visitors.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Should I assume that when Smart Traveller says that the laws apply equally to visitors, that includes even people who are just on layovers? Or are the laws less rigorously enforced for people on layovers?</p>  <p><strong>Background:</strong> I'm not planning on engaging in homosexuality, adultery or fornication in Dubai, but I'd rather not financially support airline routes that would expose fellow passengers to the risk of jail.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
1856	Where in the Balkans is free camping permitted?	<p>This question is a spinoff of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1340/wild-camping-in-europe">the question about wild camping in Europe</a> since none of the answers cover the area where I am now with my tent and sleeping bag (-:</p>  <p>Do any of the following countries in the Balkans allow free camping in the countryside, or maybe limited to certain areas such as beaches or mountains?</p>  <ul> <li>Bulgaria</li> <li>Serbia</li> <li>Macedonia (FYROM)</li> <li>Albania</li> <li>Greece</li> </ul> 
8642	Can I buy a prepaid mobile data plan while on route in France?	<p>I will be driving through France soon and would like to have a local prepaid sim with data capabilities. I found a very interesting sollution in the <a href="http://frenchconnection.fr/02_how.aspx">French Connection</a>, but I need a French delivery address. I don't have that on such a short notice, so I am looking for a plan that I could buy while on route (gas station, shopping malls, etc)</p> 
14888	Am I entitled to air passengers compensation if my flight was cancelled and I did not get a re-route?	<p>Recently a flight was cancelled and I think I was mistreated. On the day, about 5 of the flights from the airport got cancelled, they claimed it was because of bad weather. I had to wait for two more hours after my estimated departure time only to get information that my flight was cancelled.</p>  <p>However, 5 minutes from the information being anounced, another airlines plane departed from the same airport, and other departures were also succesful.</p>  <p>I did not get any re-routing options and was told I can re-book or refund at their website. They did not have any available flights until after more than a week and therefore I am not able to get home for Easter. I cried all day as I am spending Easter alone now.</p>  <p>Am I eligible for compensation? Shall I challenge the airline that the weather conditions were not to be considered as extreme circumstances?</p> 
14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days. I have already got visitor's visa for the same on my Indian passport. Particulars mentioned on my visa are:  1. 'Etats Schengen' , 2. Single entry 3. Dates of visit. &amp; 4. Type of visa : C.  I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p> 
3598	What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?	<p>As we know, most countries require that visitors have a return or onward ticket as a condition of entry.</p>  <p>But often, depending on where you're from and which country you're visiting, you won't be asked to show such ticket.</p>  <p>Now many backpackers like to travel without exact plans made in advance, including buying all one-way tickets when they are finished with one country and have decided where to go next.</p>  <p><strong>But what happens when you're travelling this way and they actually do ask you for proof of return/onward passage?</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Are you sent back on the next plane at your own expense?</li> <li>Will you have some opportunity to buy a ticket at this time?</li> <li>Will this be unlikely to happen in the first place because the airport where you board will tell you whether you'll need a ticket?</li> </ul>  <p>To make it all specific, I'm asking about my friend travelling on an Iranian passport who wants to fly into Malaysia with a one way ticket and travel around Southeast Asia.</p>  <p>Personally I've never been asked to show this proof in an airport but I have at land borders after visa runs and in immigration offices when getting visa extensions. <strong>But</strong> a friend who travels on a British passport was asked for this proof when she flew into Malaysia about two years ago. Lucky for her it was a rare occasion where she actually did have a return ticket.</p>  <p><strong>What will Malaysia do if you are asked to prove onward/return travel but only have a one-way ticket?</strong></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I can't answer what Malaysia would do if they asked for such proof because when I arrived they did not ask.</p>  <p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, when I was checking in for my flight at the Air Asia X desk in Sydney they did ask me. And they did accept my $10 e-ticket for the train to Singapore as proof.</p>

4213	Last minute flight bookings - better to book online or at the airport?	<p>We had <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2952/108">a question here earlier on booking flight tickets in the weeks running up to holiday season</a>, which covered ground on what happens to flight prices over the period.</p>  <p>What I'm interested to know is if I had to fly out at short notice, say within 1-2 days, then am I better off booking within that 1-2 day gap online, or am I better off trying my luck directly at the airport (as long as I'm willing to wait at the airport) for a cheaper price? Is there any truth to rumours that airlines sell tickets at cheaper prices at the airport right before flights to fill empty seats or is that a myth?</p> 
14297	Is it possible to travel on cargo airplanes?	<p>Some time ago I heard someone telling about travelling in cargo planes. Apparently some of those planes have a limited amount of extra seats and companies would sell them for an extra profit.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any information about this? Is that still possible? </p> 
5224	Are there any airlines that still allow smoking on-board flights?	<p>Do any airlines still allow smoking on-board international flights, or is this something that has been banned across the board everywhere? If this is because of fire hazard regulations, what about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette">e-cigarettes</a>?</p> 
5853	Does flying east to west generally take longer than west to east in America?	<p>I noticed for a particular round-trip that the portion from the east coast to the west was scheduled to take over an hour longer than the return trip.  I initially thought this was a mistake due to time zone or daylight-savings time oddities, but that does not appear to be the case.</p>  <p>I know there are a number of variables that can affect flight time (type of jet, winds, even potentially rotation of the Earth itself), so I was wondering if this sort of thing is typical.  This particular instance happens to use the same model plane for both trips and is non-stop, so most factors seem to be controlled for aside from east-west vs. west-east.  Is the longer flight a good candidate to arrive early (or is the shorter flight a good candidate to arrive late)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I recognize from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/5601/307">this question</a> that winds are likely to be the dominant factor, but that still does not answer my question.  I'm specifically asking about the USA and I don't know what sorts of winds are typical (or whether or not it depends largely on southwest vs. northwest, etc.).</p> 
18720	Do I need both a UK visa and a Schengen visa?	<p>I am a Filipino Citizen working in Qatar and have a valid Residence Permit. I am planning to visit my wife's sister in the UK, and afterwards we are planning a Schengen tour with the other family member living in the UK. Do I need to get two visas which is a UK Visa from UK embassy (my point of entry) and at the same time another visa which is a Schengen visa from the France's embassy?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
6915	Is there a booking site for chartering flights?	<p>Are there booking sites for chartering flights? A Google journey revealed many sites where one could enquire for details on chartering a plane, but so far all the enquiring needs to be done by sending an email.</p>  <p>Are there sites where you can indicate the number of people in your traveling party, plus origin and destination, and then get an instant quote?</p>  <p>In other words, I want to go from Airport A to B, with say a party of 10. I want to find out how much would that cost me if I rent a complete plane with pilots instead of booking 10 tickets.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
18492	Are international transfer zones typical around the world?	<p>Most, if not all, European airports have international transfer zones, meaning that if you don't have to pass customs and immigration check of the country the airport is located in. On the other hand in US airports do not have international transfer zones. <em>(Note that in case of Schengen zone countries "international" would mean out-of-Schengen)</em>. </p>  <p>How about rest of the world, which case is more typical? </p>  <p>Note: I'm not expecting full list of countries, just general indication what's the case in other regions. </p> 
13430	Do I need a transit visa to travel from US to India via Europe	<p>I am an Indian citizen planning to go to India via London or Frankfurt. I won't go outside of airport. I heard rumor that you need a transit visa due to changes in European policies. Is this true ? Does it make sense at all </p> 
7813	Road trip planner online	<p>I'm considering a cross-country (USA) road trip sometime in the near future -- the consideration of it keeps me alive until I can get out on the road... I messed around on Google Maps, but it stopped letting me add destinations after the "X"th one (or the 24th numerically) </p>  <p>Has anyone used a good ONLINE service that allows for many destinations (over 75)? </p>  <p>If not, looks like I'll be taking it back to the paper giants and some trusty, 'ole needles to mark! </p> 
7984	What's the nearest train station to Mont Saint-Michel?	<p>What's the nearest train station to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Saint-Michel" rel="nofollow">Mont Saint-Michel</a>? Do I need to take a bus to visit it?</p>  <p>How much time does it take? Can I make it in half a day?</p> 
17113	What rail cards / passes / discounts should visitors to Switzerland be aware of	<p>Yesterday, I took a train from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/16712/do-any-of-the-ski-resorts-near-zurich-offer-late-season-may-skiing">Zurich to Engelberg</a>, and bought a ticket from a ticket machine at the station for the journey. I was running a bit late for the train, so there wasn't time to queue up to ask for advice, I just had time to put the machine into English, tell it where I wanted to go, and pay for the return.</p>  <p>On the way there, there was a ticket check on both trains. Based on those around me, I appeared to be the only person with a regular paper train ticket! Everyone else had either a credit card sized card they showed, or a card with a long ticket, or an A4 printout, or a pass.</p>  <p>That made me think that perhaps there were railcards / rail passes / special tickets / etc that I could perhaps have bought instead, if I'd only known about them....</p>  <p>For someone who's only going to Switzerland for a few days, what railcards / rail passes / etc should you be aware of, to investigate if they'll save money?</p> 
18794	Is it possible to take a desktop PC as carry-on luggage?	<p>I am moving from Egypt to the Netherlands and I need to take my PC with me. I won't be taking the monitor, just the case, but I'm wondering what the best way would be.</p>  <p>Am considering taking it as carry-on because I'm allowed 8kg and at least then I can handle it myself. Has anyone done this before and can give me tips or warn me that this doesn't work? Would putting it in my normal suitcase as checked baggage be a better idea?</p> 
13065	Is there a website for searching/booking European trains?	<p>Is there a website to search for European train tickets? I mean something like kayak.com, expedia.com, airfare.com, etc for trains? I know there are specific countries' website like bahn.de, sbb.ch, voyages-sncf.com, etc. But is there a website to search and see the prices easily without having to go through many steps?</p> 
1237	Unplanned backpacking across several European countries	<p>I'm an undergraduate student, and upon graduating from my university a year from now, I want to travel solo across Europe. </p>  <p>I want to be on this vacation for a month and a half. The catch is that I don't want the trip to be completely planned beforehand - for a sense of 'adventure'. Applying for a Schengen tourist visa would mean that I would have to show a detailed travel itinerary with hostels I'd plan to stay in.</p>  <p>Some questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Now I don't want to decide on hostels beforehand - I would know which countries I will visit and in what order, but I might, at some point, choose to travel to some random city and stay in a hostel there. Will the consulate be okay with such semi-unplanned travel?</p></li> <li><p>I have been saving up money for such a trip since the last two years through various internships and projects - I have about 7000 USD that I'm willing to burn. Is this amount enough for such a time period? Should I consider a shorter duration? I'm willing to settle with really cheap accommodation; I don't care much about luxury.</p></li> <li><p>Are there trans-Europe vehicle rental agencies that can loan me a motorbike which I can collect from point A and ride till point B, where I could return it?</p></li> </ol> 
16	Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?	<p>My wife and I have decided to move across Europe by train. Do you know of any good sites for planning a trip via train (schedule and maybe prices)? We're going to go across Europe from east (Russia and Baltic countries) to west (France and Germany).<br> I've found only <a href="http://www.oebb.at/">http://www.oebb.at/</a>.</p> 
8079	Need some advice from the pros about interrailing around Europe!	<p>I am going interrailing with two of my friends (all of us are 21 years old and male- if that helps?) from the end of July to mid August. We are getting the 22 day global pass and are actually starting in Barcelona as we have got cheap flights to get there. Although it is only 22 days pass that doesn't include 3 nights in barcelona (as we are not using the pass til we leave there as we wont be using it in Barca); so we will be going for 25 days. The route is:</p>  <p>Barcelona</p>  <p>French Riviera</p>  <p>Milan</p>  <p>Munich</p>  <p>Prague</p>  <p>Berlin</p>  <p>Amsterdam</p>  <p>Brussels</p>  <p>London (Home).</p>  <p>The plan is to stay 2 or 3 nights in each city. None of us have done the whole travelling thing before and so don't quite know what is right and wrong in terms of money and what to take (how much clothing, do we take a lot of cash or rely on card machines, etc). One of the main issues that I have is the amount of money I am going to need. I think I can get around £1700 (after plane and interrail tickets) in money to take on the trip. So obviously that has to cover everything, from accommodation to food to going out. So that should give me about £68 a day.. Is that going to be enough in the places we are going? What are the places on the list that will cost me most? Obviously we will be drinking, etc in the nights and sightseeing during the day, so I am worried this won't be enough money. I am assuming that barcelona, french riviera and milan will be the big hitters in terms of alcohol costs and accommodation prices? Basically just asking you guys (and girls) for some guidance about money and what to expect to be spending for what in the places we are visting. Also any help on what I should pack (such as essential items that I wouldn't want to not have in my luggage) and how many sets of clothing, would also be very helpful.</p> 
10824	Inexpensive eating-out food in western Europe	<p>In Asian cities (including modern/first-world cities such as Singapore), there are a lot of food centers which sell decent, but very inexpensive food. For example, in Singapore they are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre">Hawker Centres</a>. It is very common throughout the city, and the food can be as low as costing only $3 (I would say, 1/5 of a meal in mid-range restaurants, and maybe almost equal the cost of cooking it on your own). It is very convenient if you don't want to spend a lot for eating out, yet you don't want to spend a lot of time cooking.</p>  <p>So far I haven't found anything similar in Western Europeans (or North American) major cities. There are some food shop and stalls which are somewhat cheaper than restaurants, but the difference is not as big as restaurants vs hawker centres. </p>  <p>Is there something analogous to this in Western Europe? If not, why? There must also be people who don't want to always eat out at expensive restaurants, yet also prefer not to have to cook? </p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
13731	What is the cheapest / fastest way to get from Brussels to Paris?	<p>There are several ways of getting from Brussels to Paris. The fastest is probably the train, but it gets more expensive when you buy the ticket on the last minute.</p>  <p>My question can be really split into two:</p>  <p>Is there an alternative way, maybe through a different ticket operator, of buying a cheap train ticket from Brussels to Paris in short notice?</p>  <p>The alternative is going by Bus. What alternatives are there? Are there other operators besides Eurolines? maybe cheaper and/or faster?</p>  <p>Are there other options?</p> 
12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p> 
17037	Traveling with two passports - which one to use?	<p>I have two passport one is Saudi and the other is British. </p>  <p>My question is I am in Saudi Arabia and I want to travel to the UK and back how does that work?</p>  <p>And do I need a visa for any of the two counties? </p> 
18862	Is there a cheaper (slower) way to get by train from Brussels to Paris than Thalys?	<p>I'm wondering if there is a cheaper way to get from Brussels to Paris by train than Thalys. Thalys prices are alright if you book some time in advance, but it can be quite expensive if you book only a few days before. I don't mind if the travel time takes some extra hours.</p>  <p>This is related to the question “<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13731/what-is-the-cheapest-fastest-way-to-get-from-brussels-to-paris">What is the cheapest / fastest way to get from Brussels to Paris?</a>” but no one mentioned other options by train than Thalys there. Perhaps going through Lille is a possibility?</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
6629	Duty-free liquids on a connecting flight in the US	<p>I am going to the USA next week and want to bring some bottles of the good stuff as presents for my relatives living over there.</p>  <p>My flight was cheap however it requires me to make a stop over.</p>  <ul> <li>Glasgow to Newark</li> <li>Newark to Seattle</li> </ul>  <p>My question is regarding the security issue with Liquids. </p>  <p>You are only allowed 100ml containers with liquid however if you buy stuff in Duty Free in the Airport before your connection are you able to get past this restriction.</p>  <p>e.g.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If I buy a bottle of Whisky at Glasgow international airport and carry it with me on Hand Luggage, will I not be allowed through with it when I get my connection flight from Newark. Or am I past the security barrier when I come of the plane and wont go through any baggage checks?</p> </blockquote> 
11572	Can I connect through the USA with liquid duty-free purchases?	<p>In the near future I'll be travelling DUB-ORD-PDX and I was wondering if I can make liquid duty-free purchases in Dublin and bring them through security as carry-on luggage in Chicago O'Hare.</p>  <p>I will be changing terminal in O'Hare (T5 -> T1), so I have to re-clear security. In some EU airports the security people treat sealed, clear duty-free bags as "safe" for the purposes of the liquids ban. Do they do likewise in Chicago?</p>  <p>I won't have the opportunity to re-pack anything I buy and put it in my hold baggage since that will be checked through (I clear US customs in Dublin).</p> 
17821	Flying stand by from US to Europe -- is it still worth it, and if so, how to do it?	<p>The title summarizes my question pretty well. Basically, I'm looking for a cheap way to fly from California to Europe (Germany, preferably).</p>  <p>Since I have to fly this route several times a year, and I'm a student, it'd be helpful to reduce the price.</p>  <p>So, my question is whether stand by flying is doable, and if so, is it worth it? How much are the typical savings, and how do you purchase a stand by ticket?</p> 
3738	Tromsø for the Aurora Borealis in March	<p>Is March too late for seeing the Aurora Borealis (northern lights) in Tromsø, Norway? There is a new moon on the 21st and I would be looking to go around then.</p>  <p>I'm aware it's weather and light dependent hence why I would go around the time of a new moon.</p> 
5902	Is there any 3g data package that works across Europe?	    <blockquote>   <p>I will travel to Europe this year. Is there any 3G with data package   that will be work on most of this selected cities (London - Amsterdam   - Munich - Venice - Paris ) How much it would be?</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1475/is-there-any-3g-with-data-package-that-will-be-work-across-europe-how-to-go-t">Question originally by Rudy</a>, but was combined with another question so I split it out.</p> 
16846	What is cheapest phone option for a short trip to Europe?	<p>I'm leaving for Europe in a couple days. I'm spending a few days in England and then a few days in Hungary before returning to the US. Unfortunately, I have not given much thought to my phone/internet options until now.</p>  <p>Anticipated needs: </p>  <ul> <li><p>5-10 phone calls total, all in-country, with no more than 60 minutes total talk time;</p></li> <li><p>30-50 text messages total, all in-country;</p></li> <li><p>light Web browsing, with a conservative (high) estimate of 75MB/day for data use.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I have a Verizon iPhone 5 and am willing to take it to use with a different SIM or, if I must, to use as-is with Verizon's "Global Services" rates. For reference, the latter are the same for both England and Hungary: $1.29/minute for voice, $0.50/$0.05 to send/receive texts, and $0.25/MB for data.</p>  <p>What is my best option? Best means both cheap/convenient, but weighted mainly toward cheap.</p>  <p>Happy to elaborate if more info needed.</p> 
2736	Choices for prepaid GSM data with laptop tethering in Europe?	<p>Planning a trip to Europe later this year that will definitely include Italy, and will most likely include the UK, Germany, and a smattering of connecting and/or distractingly shiny countries. Here in the US, I have both a 4G and 3G mifi and it would be nifty to keep that kind of connectivity while I'm traveling. Both of those gizmos are US-only. My connectivity affects my ability to work while traveling, so it's no exaggeration to say that I'll stay an extra month if I can solve this issue.</p>  <p>I know the trick of landing with an unlocked phone and shoving in a local SIM card, but it's a pain to figure out tethering options for my laptop, which is my #1 priority. (#2 priority: Google Maps.) Are there no-contract providers for this kind of usage?</p>  <p>Question 1a) Alternately, are there EU grace periods for returning a phone and getting a refund? In the US, you get 14 days to return a cell phone.</p>  <p>1b) If the answer to the above is "no", as it would be in the US, are there better options for widespread wifi hookups than Boingo?</p> 
18394	If, like Edward Snowden, your passport was revoked or cancelled, how could you travel?	<p>As per the news, NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden has had his passport revoked by the United States Government.  </p>  <p>From the article:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It was not immediately clear how Snowden was able to travel,</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, he was able to fly from Hong Kong to Russia, and apparently plans to continue on to Latin America / Cuba.  </p>  <p><strong>With a revoked passport, how is one legally able to travel internationally??</strong></p> 
6532	Indian Railways-Online Reservation Rules	<p>I booked an online ticket for traveling on Indian Railways for a Short Distance Journey, but my ticket was not confirmed at all and is on the waiting list. </p>  <p>Can I travel with the waiting list ticket in the General Compartment?</p> 
2764	How useful or necessary is a pacsafe for your backpack?	<p>I will be taking a backpacking trip through SE Asia, South Africa and South America for an extended period of time.</p>  <p>I am taking a 36L backpack, and trying to bring as few things as possible. However, I will be carrying a laptop, DSLR camera and some other electronic gear so that I can work while traveling.</p>  <p><strong>Is a pacsafe, or something else that surrounds your backpack for security reasons, a necessary or useful item that would warrant the extra space and weight in my pack?</strong></p> 
3598	What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?	<p>As we know, most countries require that visitors have a return or onward ticket as a condition of entry.</p>  <p>But often, depending on where you're from and which country you're visiting, you won't be asked to show such ticket.</p>  <p>Now many backpackers like to travel without exact plans made in advance, including buying all one-way tickets when they are finished with one country and have decided where to go next.</p>  <p><strong>But what happens when you're travelling this way and they actually do ask you for proof of return/onward passage?</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Are you sent back on the next plane at your own expense?</li> <li>Will you have some opportunity to buy a ticket at this time?</li> <li>Will this be unlikely to happen in the first place because the airport where you board will tell you whether you'll need a ticket?</li> </ul>  <p>To make it all specific, I'm asking about my friend travelling on an Iranian passport who wants to fly into Malaysia with a one way ticket and travel around Southeast Asia.</p>  <p>Personally I've never been asked to show this proof in an airport but I have at land borders after visa runs and in immigration offices when getting visa extensions. <strong>But</strong> a friend who travels on a British passport was asked for this proof when she flew into Malaysia about two years ago. Lucky for her it was a rare occasion where she actually did have a return ticket.</p>  <p><strong>What will Malaysia do if you are asked to prove onward/return travel but only have a one-way ticket?</strong></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I can't answer what Malaysia would do if they asked for such proof because when I arrived they did not ask.</p>  <p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, when I was checking in for my flight at the Air Asia X desk in Sydney they did ask me. And they did accept my $10 e-ticket for the train to Singapore as proof.</p> 
18615	Fly into Singapore or Kuala Lumpur on one-way ticket to begin overlanding trip?	<p>I want to begin my next big overlanding trip by flying from Sydney (home) to either Singapore or Malaysia on a one-way ticket. I will fly home from an as-yet unknown location when my money runs down low or winter gets in the way.</p>  <p>I know many countries or specific airports have policies that arrivals must have a return ticket or an onward ticket to somewhere. I understand that this may be checked when you board the plane but often is not enforced by anyone at all.</p>  <p>What I would like to know is which of these two destinations is more likely to not care about my onward ticket, or to have the cheaper way of proving that I'm leaving.</p>  <p>For instance if I absolutely have to show an onward ticket I'd prefer to be able to arrange some bus ticket or train ticket or ferry ticket, than a flight ticket. And I'd prefer a ticket that is easy to get a full or partial refund on.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>Immigration at Kuala Lumpur did not ask me any questions, including whether I had an onward ticket.</p>  <p><strong><em>but</em></strong> the "document check and baggage drop" counter at Air Asia X in Sydney <em>did</em> ask. They accepted my train ticket to Singapore (which cost about $10).</p>  <p>(I'm not submitting this as an answer because I can't compare to flying into Singapore, since I have not tried that yet.)</p> 
5801	Stuck without toilet paper while travelling - what is the best approach?	<p>Well, this has happened to everyone at some point - you find out there is no toilet paper just after you need it the most. Usually it's not a big deal, even in public toilet room you can wait until you hear someone nearby and kindly ask for paper.</p>  <p>However when such thing happens in a foreign country it  might get more complicated, e.g. you don't speak the native language well enough to know what to ask for or you fear the response of people from different culture.</p>  <p>Personally this happened to me only once in a "friendly" place (USA) with culture very similar to what I have at home (Israel) so I knew what you ask for and got help rather fast, but ever since I wonder sometimes what I would do in totally "foreign" place.</p>  <p>So, suppose such thing happens - what is considered best practice? Are there any cultures that might consider such request from innocent tourist as rude or even offensive?</p> 
3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple.

1703	Is there any online resource that can tell me what visa rules are for passport holders of a specific country?	<p>When thinking about travelling, I often have to think about a place to visit, and then look up visa rules for that particular country. This can be a fairly painful process because official government sites can often be hard to find, and advice on (say) guidebooks or Wikitravel tends to be generic.</p>  <p>Is there any resource where I can enter my nationality/residency, and then look up a list of visa rules for various countries?</p>

At best a Google search finds an embassy webpage which you then have to trawl through it to get the actual answer to your question. Are there better approaches out there?</p> 
5496	VAT refund at Luton airport	<p>I'm a non-EU citizen, leaving London from Luton airport. I'm trying to understand how to get a VAT refund on my way out. All I was able to find is <a href="http://www.london-luton.co.uk/en/faq/3/43/how-do-i-obtain-a-vat-refund.html" rel="nofollow">this very sparse description at the airport website</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You need to bring your VAT receipts and contact details to the Airport in a sealed envelope. Once you have passed through the security search area, before you go through to the Departures Lounge, there is a blue HM Customs post box mounted on the wall.  Post the envelope in the box.  The box is emptied by HM Customs on a daily basis and the contents are taken away for processing.  If you cannot see the box, please ask any member of staff to direct you to it.</p> </blockquote>  <p>It doesn't say which products are eligible, or if I need any specific forms, or anything like that. Does anyone have experience they can share about VAT refund from the UK in general, and at Luton in particular?</p> 
110	What is the best method for exchanging dollars for Euros?	<p>I'm traveling from the US to Europe in a few weeks.  <strong>What's the best method of exchanging dollars for Euros</strong>?  </p>  <p>I imagine there's options like:</p>  <ul> <li>at the airport when you arrive in Europe</li> <li>at a bank in the US before you leave</li> <li>at a bank in Europe upon arriving</li> </ul>

I would also imagine that it is theoretically possible to hitch a flight with a non-commercial plane where you want to go. I'm thinking international fares in the double digit range.</p>  <p>Of course, the kind of travel I'm imagining would not be comfortable or convenient. I'm thinking things that might be borderline "stowaway", but legal and ethical. I don't mean flight search websites, promotional deals, or other obvious ways of flying cheap.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience or ideas on how I could travel like this?</p> 
14297	Is it possible to travel on cargo airplanes?	<p>Some time ago I heard someone telling about travelling in cargo planes.

17821	Flying stand by from US to Europe -- is it still worth it, and if so, how to do it?	<p>The title summarizes my question pretty well.

9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
17833	Is there a way to store stage luggage until needed?	<p>I'm an artist/DJ that is looking to travel soon.  I'm a fairly light traveler with the exception of my equipment which is just a little more than I can carry at one time.  I don't have any gigs scheduled per se. But if an opportunity were to arise, It would be nice to have my equipment available.  I was wondering if there was a way to ship my equipment for storage until I needed it.  When I do need my equipment, I could request that it gets shipped to a specified address.  </p>  <p><strong>Is there such a service? Or is this merely a business plan?</strong></p>  <p>As a side note, I don't have anybody within my reach that I can trust to have my stuff shipped in a timely fashion.</p> 
8225	Is it possible to book an hotel being a minor?	<p>I've been in Morocco nearly a month, and it will soon be time for my return. During my stay here, checking into hotel rooms hasn't been an issue, but businesses aren't nearly as lenient about that sort of thing in America. I have a day layover in Newark, and I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for me to stay at one of the hotels nearby. I'm 17 years old, and my birthday is only 16 days after the time I'd need the room. Are exceptions ever made in situations like these?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
1504	Will an Iranian or Kuwaiti visa or stamp in my passport pose a problem on a future visit to Israel?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1497/are-there-any-repercussions-from-having-an-israeli-stamp-in-my-passport">this question I learned that entering Kuwait with an Israeli stamp in your passport will be a problem</a>. (Less surprising was that Iran doesn't like them either).</p>  <p>Later during my current trip I am hoping to visit Kuwait via Iran and I certainly intend to visit Israel at some point in the future.</p>  <p>Since these issues are often but not always reciprocal I would like to know if the Kuwait stamp will be a problem when visiting Israel or if they are less fussy than the reverse.</p>  <p>I'm expecting that the Iran stamp will definitely be a problem for an Israel visit but I'd be glad to be proven wrong.</p> 
1497	Are there any repercussions from having an Israeli stamp in my passport?	<p>I have heard people say that having a stamp from Israel in your passport can cause problems when trying to get into other countries.</p>  <p>Is there any truth to this statement? If so, which countries does it create issues with?</p> 
12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p>

11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
6997	Where can I buy a "roaming" or "international" SIM card — one with attached phone numbers in multiple countries?	<p>In the past I have found two companies that offered one sim card with multiple (international) numbers attached to it. The first one, of which I forgot the name, offered one sim card with the possibility to add different european numbers to it. They don't longer exist, hopefully because they were ahead of their time. </p>  <p>I recently learned of the existence of a <a href="http://www.telesur.nl/telesurnederland/website/home.asp?menuid=2">Surinamese company</a> that offers a so called "two country sim". It gives both a Surinamese and a Dutch mobile telephone number. You are always available through both numbers. Both in the Netherlands and in Suriname you won't have roaming costs. The company aims at the large Surinamese community in the Netherlands. </p>  <p>I do like this concept. Since I travel frequently I would really like to have such a sim card. Since telesur proves that the technology works, there should be others. Does anyone know of similar companies, preferably combining Belgian, Dutch, German, French and UK numbers?</p> 
3596	Places to stop off along the Sydney to Brisbane railway?	<p>I'm hoping this is a constrained enough question to not produce either long lists, or lots of subjective answers, so here goes...</p>  <p>In December I'm going to want to get from Sydney to Brisbane. I won't have a car, and it's just a one way trip, so the obvious choices would seem to be either fly, or take the train. (Well, train then bus from Casino!) While the train looks to be slightly cheaper, when luggage fees are included, I've noticed that a <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/discovery">CountryLink East Coast Discover Pass</a> is about the same price as the flight + bag fees.</p>  <p>If I was to get a <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/travel_passes/discovery">CountryLink East Coast Discover Pass</a>, then I'd be able to make my way from Sydney up to Brisbane by train + bus, stopping as often as I like (as long as I don't backtrack). My idea was to maybe take something like 3-4 days to do the trip, stopping at a couple of places along the way (plus charging my gadgets up too - one snag I hit last time with the train is the lack of power points!)</p>  <p>What I'm not sure on is where along the North Coast that's served by CountryLink is worth stopping at for a day? I won't have a car with me, nor will I have that long, so visiting some of the more far-flung beaches is out. Between Sydney and Grafton I'm largely limited to two trains a day (I don't think I'll want to take the overnight one), and for the Garfton to Brisbane leg I've no real choice (XPT to Casino then bus looks the only sensible bet). The <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/timetables">timetable listing is here</a>, and <a href="http://www.countrylink.info/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/17259/NorthCoastRegion-23_Oct_2011.pdf">this is the current timetable</a></p>  <p>For places to stop off at, they'd need sensibly priced accommodation near the station, as I'll likely not be packed for long walks with everything. I wouldn't mind a stop that would allow for some scuba diving, but otherwise places with one of interesting walking, a nice beach or a museum would be good. Oh, and I probably wouldn't stop at Surfers or anywhere north of there, as I can pop back to them from Brisbane later! I guess in addition to a whole day stop, I could always get the earlier Casino XPT, hop off for a couple of hours and see somewhere, then take the later Grafton XPT on to where I'm staying, so suggestions for somewhere for a museum / quick walk / etc might also be good!</p>  <p>So, along the route covered by the discovery pass, are there any places that would be recommended for a 1 day stop? And anywhere that might be interesting for a few hours?</p> 
1571	Getting to the sea from Oxford	<p>I live in Oxford, UK, which is a lovely place, but I do wish it was a bit closer to the sea. What's the best way to get to a beach, starting from here?

3197	What on earth has yet to be explored?	<p>To be clear, yes, we can see everything from Google Earth or other satellite imagery, but that doesn't mean we can explore it.  GE can't see into forests, canyons and caves.</p>  <p>Has every mountain been scaled? Has every ocean depth been mapped? Has every jungle been navigated?</p>  <p><strong>Basically, the question is, is there any part of our planet left to explore?</strong> To put your foot on a rock and shove a flag in the ground and name it whatever you please.  What are the main areas left for exploration that someone might want to try and do.  Clearly not every square foot of the Sahara has been navigated, but that's a bit harder than say, a North American forest.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen).

442	When travelling overland in Russia I hear you must register with the police in each new place, but does this cost money?	<p>When travelling overland in Russia (i.e. not on the Trans-Siberian) I hear you must register with the police in each new place, but does this cost money?</p>  <p>I know there are some gotchas with registering with the police when travelling in Russia but is there a fee or are bribes common when registering? And what about getting caught without registering? Also is there a minimum time I must spend in a place before registering must be done?</p>

She'd very much like to use her iPhone during her stay in the United States.</p>  <p>What are her options for getting prepaid talk, text and data services without also having to buy a new phone? I realize that she'll be limited to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile because of the GSM network.</p>  <p>As far as I've read, T-Mobile SIM cards only work on T-Mobile branded phones, so is AT&amp;T her only option there?</p> 
8638	Travel from South East Asia to Europe by land	<p>Does anyone have experience or know about travelling from South East Asia to Europe, all by land? I'd be happy to catch a quick flight here and there but would prefer to do the entire trip by land.</p>  <p>I really don't know much about making the trip and would love to receive some first-hand advice. I really don't have to stick to any plan/time constraints, but I'll ideally start the trip in Thailand and end up anywhere in Europe.</p>  <ul> <li>What's the best route?</li> <li>How long should it take?</li> <li>What sort of monthly budget would I need?</li> </ul>  <p>Thank you!</p> 
11	What is the best way to obtain visas for the Trans-Siberian/Trans-Mongolian Railway?	<p>I'm planning on taking the trans-Siberian / trans-Mongolian from Moscow to Beijing via Ulaan Bataar next year and I'd like some advice on how best to organise the visa situation. </p>  <p>I'm a British citizen, partner is Swedish. We'll need visas for Russia, China and Mongolia. Seeing as you can only book the train tickets like 3 months in advance and you need to get all the visas together in that time as well, the process seems likely to be a bit complicated. Especially if you end up getting declined for a visa. </p>  <p>What is the best process or method for obtaining the visas (in which country order) and is there any kind of trustworthy service that will do it for me? If I go through a service, what happens if one of my visas is declined?</p>

4864	What should I look for in a vehicle insurance policy for taking my US vehicle into Mexico?	<p>I have been told that driving my private vehicle from California into Mexico is no big deal EXCEPT that I must have Mexican insurance. I am looking for specific recommendations about what to look for when buying the insurance - are all policies basically the same, is there an official agency that needs to underwrite the policies, are there exemptions to be wary of, etc etc. If you know of approximate cost of the policies, please post that as well.</p>

6451	Is it easier/cheaper for an Indonesian with UK residency to obtain a tourist visa for Bulgaria, Romania, or Schengen?	<p>A friend of mine who is a citizen of Indonesia with UK residency (but not citizenship) would like to meet up with me somewhere with a cheap undeveloped beach. (I'll be hitchhiking from Georgia.)</p>  <p>The problem is there's tons of unexpected rules and fees for Indonesians to get a visa for these places.</p>  <p>I can't see anywhere that having UK residency helps but maybe I missed it. Also whether having a Schengen visa first might make it easier to get a visa for Bulgaria or Romania.</p>  <p>Yes we have looked at the relevant government visa sites but it's a lot to take in and keep sorted. We're wondering if somebody might have first hand experience. Maybe some things are not as strict as the websites make them look. Maybe we missed something for one country that makes it easier or cheaper than the others.</p>  <p>Does anybody know this stuff already?</p>

9066	What kind of trousers or shorts are suitable for long-distance summer walking / hitchhiking?	<p>Normally I'm exclusively a jeans/denim man no matter the weather: Comfortable, cheap, reasonably durable, can wear with anything, acceptable in conservative destinations, can get away with periods of not washing, available to purchase everywhere.</p>  <p><strong>But now I need you my fellow experts to tell me what to wear instead when walking or hitchhiking vast distances in hot climates.</strong></p>  <p>I've been known to walk up to thirteen hours straight carrying all my stuff (currently about 30kg).

I call it "<em>staff</em> standby" because the questions I've seen so far seem to suggest that this is becoming less available to the public, but is still sometimes available to select groups (airline staff, etc).   It also seems like the answer might vary dependent on region.</p>  <p>So, currently (mid-2013) in the SEA region, can one still buy low price 'standby-priority'/'space-available' tickets?</p>  <p>(If it doesn't broaden the scope unacceptably, then as a follow-up: What similar possibilities exist, currently in this region?  (Last-minute non-stanby bookings, dramatically cheaper off-peak/red-eye rates, etc.))</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> some related recent questions (which got me thinking about this):<br> <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18669/are-there-any-secrets-or-tricks-to-flying-for-free-or-almost-free">Are there any secrets or tricks to flying for free (or almost free)?</a><br> <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/14297/is-it-possible-to-travel-on-cargo-aeroplanes">Is it possible to travel on cargo aeroplanes?</a><br> <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17821/flying-stand-by-from-us-to-europe-is-it-still-worth-it-and-if-so-how-to-do?lq=1">Flying stand by from US to Europe -- is it still worth it, and if so, how to do it?</a></p> 
8138	What are the options for a prepaid SIM card in Germany?	<p>I'll be staying in Berlin for one month and I have an unlocked iPhone (GSM) that I'd like to use while I'm here. What are my choices for SIM cards and packages that include data?</p> 
19757	Hamburg public transport tickets for a 3 day / 48 hour trip?	<p>I'm going for a weekend to Hamburg, and I'm trying to work out the best public transport ticket(s) to get. I'll be arriving on a Friday evening, leaving on a Sunday, but spending less than 48 hours in the city. I'll need to get to and from the airport to the city centre, then the rest of the time will be in and around the city sightseeing. I'm not planning to go very far out of the city, so I don't think I'll be needing regional coverage on my tickets.</p>  <p>I've tried looking on the <a href="http://www.hvv.de/en/tickets/" rel="nofollow">HVV english site</a> for ticket information, but there was a surprisingly large number of options! Off peak (post-9am) day tickets look to be as low as €5.80, or there's a special weekend ticket for €42, with lots in between!</p>  <p>Will I be best off with some sort of multi-day or weekend ticket? Or would something like a single from the airport for the Friday, then two day tickets work out cheaper?</p> 
18147	What to do in Las Vegas without having to sin?	<p>For religious reasons, I don't</p>  <ul> <li>gamble</li> <li>drink alcohol</li> <li>engage in fornication</li> <li>visit prostitution or strip clubs</li> </ul>  <p>Are there still interesting things for people like me in Vegas?</p>  <p>It is a week-long business trip, with a weekend stay.</p> 
1980	Las Vegas - What is good to do there?	<p>I've been told that unless you have a good plan for Las Vegas, you're not going to have a clue what to do when you get there.</p>  <p>I and my two brothers have a trip planned in October from the 2nd to the 16th. We're starting in Los Angeles and then driving to Vegas. We have things planned for Los Angeles so that part is fine. However, we're planning to stay longer in the Vegas area.</p>  <p>So far we have a single casino visit planned, tickets to see <em>Penn and Teller</em> and time at a gun range sorted. But we plan to be there from the 5th to the 14th so we need more to do.</p>  <p>This is a once in a lifetime trip for us and we don't want it to be too much of a tourist thing. We're looking to find some good places to head out and have fun. We're all in our twenties (24-28) and Irish, so somewhere we can get drunk would be great.</p>  <p>Top ideas or good tips for hanging out in Vegas would be greatly appreciated.</p> 
435	Should I purchase rental car insurance? What protection does my credit card provide?	<p>We just arrived in Hawaii this afternoon, and when I went to pick up the rental car, I discovered I hadn't done my homework with regard to the insurance options.</p>  <p>I recall that my credit card will provide some level of insurance when I use it to rent a car, but when I mentioned it to the Customer Services Representative, he informed me that my credit card only covers collision, and he suggested I purchase liability insurance from the rental agency.</p>  <p>For the future, what information do I need to collect in order to make an informed decision about what insurance policies I should (or should not) purchase when I rent a car?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
7943	Why is there a 'secret carrier' option for a flight?	<p>When searching for a flight on <a href="http://www.kayak.com/#/flights/MIA-HKG/2012-06-30-flexible-1day/2012-07-12-flexible-1day/business">kayak.com</a> (not for me, I don't fly business), it shows a "Secret Carrier" option.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RoIEK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>What gives? Why are they unable to tell us even the code-share partner? What if you want to use miles? How does the travel agent know who they're booking with?</p> 
1703	Is there any online resource that can tell me what visa rules are for passport holders of a specific country?	<p>When thinking about travelling, I often have to think about a place to visit, and then look up visa rules for that particular country. This can be a fairly painful process because official government sites can often be hard to find, and advice on (say) guidebooks or Wikitravel tends to be generic.</p>  <p>Is there any resource where I can enter my nationality/residency, and then look up a list of visa rules for various countries?</p> 
1043	Is it possible to apply for a Chinese visa while travelling outside your home country?	<p>For some countries you can only apply for a visa in your home country (Russia is such a country)</p>  <p>Is China also such a country? I was thinking of applying for a visa in the Republic of Georgia or possibly Kazakhstan. I'm already travelling outside my own country (Australia) now.</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p> 
7977	Most convenient train to arrive in France from Amsterdam?	<p>I need to travel from Amsterdam to France by train.</p>  <p>I'm not visiting Paris, but many cities all around the country. What's the most convenient train to arrive in France ?</p>  <p>I've heard there is a train connecting Amsterdam-Paris for only 35 Euros. But if I can skip Paris, it would be better (I think).</p>  <p>Also, I'm now planning my trip in 8 different cities, and I have to decide if I should buy an inter rail card. If so, should I maybe buy a card for France and Benelux as well, so I cover the trips to/from Amsterdam ?</p>  <p>PS. I can only find Interrail pass for either France or Benelux. But not both. Does a combo pass exist?</p> 
13065	Is there a website for searching/booking European trains?	<p>Is there a website to search for European train tickets? I mean something like kayak.com, expedia.com, airfare.com, etc for trains? I know there are specific countries' website like bahn.de, sbb.ch, voyages-sncf.com, etc. But is there a website to search and see the prices easily without having to go through many steps?</p> 
16	Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?	<p>My wife and I have decided to move across Europe by train. Do you know of any good sites for planning a trip via train (schedule and maybe prices)? We're going to go across Europe from east (Russia and Baltic countries) to west (France and Germany).<br> I've found only <a href="http://www.oebb.at/">http://www.oebb.at/</a>.</p> 
5408	Why is a nonstop flight sometimes more expensive than multiple connections?	<p>Usually I find a flight I like that uses one or more connections with the same or different companies. In these cases, if the distance between the first and the second connection is not too large, I prefer to go by bus or train and then take the flight. The problem is that sometimes it is more expensive to take the flight in the second airport than to take the flight from the first one. I mean, I'm wondering why sometimes it is more expensive to take only a flight than to take the same flight and another one.</p>  <p>A practical example (and real, you can check with SkyScanner). Imagine I am in Madrid (Spain) and would like to go to Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) on April 1st. The cheapest flight I have found is this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TAM airlines: MAD -> GRU -> GIG : 507 €</p> </blockquote>  <p>Fantastic! GRU is one of São Paulo's airports. That's perfect for me! I'll go on to Rio traveling overland. But then, I look for this flight (MAD -> GRU, non-stop):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TAM airlines: MAD -> GRU : 597 €</p> </blockquote>  <p>It's the same flight, 90 € more expensive! I've found this kind of behavior a lot of times and I'm intrigued to know why it happens.</p> 
5040	Can I apply for and receive a US visa when residing in country other than my own?	<p>I'm currently residing in a country other than my own, and am planning a business trip to the USA for a week. Being a Bulgarian citizen, I do not qualify for the ESTA visa waiver program, unlike other EU countries.</p>  <p>The US embassy in Sofia lists a <a href="http://bulgaria.usembassy.gov/to_apply.html">7-step procedure</a> which they inexplicably describe as "really quite easy". Unfortunately, some of the steps involved would be a major inconvenience for me, as I'm not residing in the country currently, particularly the interview and the visa/passport delivery.</p>  <p>I was hoping it could be possible to apply for a visa from the country of current residence rather than my own, but I wasn't able to find any information on the US embassy's webpages concerning this.</p> 
20017	Pakistani Traveller in Australia, who wants to apply for USA visa	<p>I am a Pakistani national who is currently in Australia on visit visa since July. I intend to visit family in the USA on my way back to Pakistan in a month or so. Can I apply for a USA visa from Australia or do I need to apply from my home country? If my question is a duplicate please share the link of the duplicate question. </p> 
20031	US tourism/business visa from non-resident country	<p>I applied for multiple visas before (not US visa), but all of them was from my residence country. In all of these cases, I can get official paper which support my evidence (bank statement, letter which states I am employed with high salary, marriage certificate, security clearance, ...).</p>  <p>It is the same question as <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5040/can-i-apply-for-and-receive-a-us-visa-when-residing-in-country-other-than-my-own">Can I apply for and receive a US visa when residing in country other than my own?</a>, but I am not residing; I have a business visa.</p>  <p>case-specific details: I am from Egypt, I have business visa for Ireland. While in Ireland, I want to apply for US business visa.</p>  <p>Why no to apply from Egypt?: Because waiting time is too long (75 days). Waiting time in Ireland in only 18 days. Both visits (Ireland, US) are short visits (3 weeks for each).</p> 
19442	Is it safe to travel to Turkey at this time (August 2013)?	<p>Given the recent protests, I'm not sure if it's safe to travel to Turkey or not. I'm no expert on these matters, so, if possible, I'd like to hear from someone familiar with those affairs or who has recently been.</p> 
9234	Valid Indian visa in an expired passport	<p>I recently had to renew my passport.  The expired one has an Indian visa that will be valid until 2016.  Is it necessary for me to get the visa transferred to the renewed passport, or can I get through customs in India (likely Mumbai) if I have both the expired and the renewed passports with me?</p> 
14401	What's the best way to travel around Greece? Train or Bus?	<p>Looks like a train pass for a 25 year old is only $150 for 5 travel days, but I hear the trains don't run everywhere, so would it just be cheaper to take the buses everywhere? And what is the best way to get to and from Greece via Istanbul? Bus/train?</p> 
19976	Can I rely on public transport in Rhodes (Greece) or should I rent a car?	<p>I'm planning to visit Rhodes in october. I see the island is not that small: Google Maps tells you'll need roughly a hour by car to travel from north to south.</p>  <p>I would like to be based in Rhodes old town (in the very north) and I'm wondering if I must rent a car in order to see some nice spots outside the city or if the main attractions (beaches, other interesting towns, etc.) are well served by public transport.</p> 
14051	VWP question regarding re entry	<p>I entered the USA on a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) on 1 July 2012 and stayed until 16 Sep 2012 (78 days).  On what date in 2013 will I be able to travel to USA again under VWP?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
10446	What is the minimum wait before I may I re-enter the USA from Australia after a 90 day visit through the non visa program?	<p>I entered the USA on a three month visa waiver program from Australia. I am about to return to  Australia and would like to come back again to the USA. How long do I have to wait until I can re-enter the USA for another 3 months?</p> 
17438	How to independently visit Saudi Arabia?	<p>I've read that Saudi Arabia doesn't grant tourist visas to independent travelers. I've also read that recently they grant visas to group of travelers, if the tour is organized by a recognized tour company.</p>  <p>The question is: what are (if any) <em>legal</em> means to independently visit Saudi Arabia? </p> 
1043	Is it possible to apply for a Chinese visa while travelling outside your home country?	<p>For some countries you can only apply for a visa in your home country (Russia is such a country)</p>  <p>Is China also such a country? I was thinking of applying for a visa in the Republic of Georgia or possibly Kazakhstan. I'm already travelling outside my own country (Australia) now.</p> 
11569	Is Visa's Emergency Cash Disbursement reliable?	<p>I have read the <a href="http://usa.visa.com/personal/cards/benefits/bft_emergency_cash.html">benefits page of Visa credit card</a>, and it says they offer Cash Disbursement in case the card is stolen and they have a Global Customer Care number people can call and they will offer the cash:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Lost, stolen or damaged card? Need emergency cash?</strong></p>      <p>Visa credit cardholders can get an emergency cash advance disbursed or a card replaced within one business day, or in some cases, within 24 hours, after approval. </p>      <p><strong>Benefit at a glance</strong></p>      <p>Call Visa Global Customer Care Services at 1-800-VISA-911 for assistance with a card replacement and/or an emergency cash disbursement.    Toll-free phone numbers are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p>      <p><strong>Benefit details</strong></p>      <p>How do I get emergency cash?   A Visa Global Customer Care Services associate (1-800-VISA-911, or call one of our global toll-free numbers) will work with you and your financial institution for approval and Visa will arrange a convenient location for you to collect the emergency cash. </p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Is this reliable for travelers? has anyone tried it and it actually worked? the "after approval" part sound suspicious to me..</strong></p> 
9987	How does one recover from a (personal) disaster while abroad, travel-wise?	<p>I was watching the Bond flick <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/combined">Die Another Day</a> last night. In it, Bond ends up in terrible shape, but manages to escape to the shores of Hong Kong, where he strolls into the lobby of a swanky hotel, is instantly recognized, and equipped, and away you go...</p>  <p>My question is this: supposing I'm NOT going to be recognized, but I've lost my wallet, all ID, everything. How do I get reconnected with my financials? Let me make it clear, I'm not asking how I get a free room and masseuse with no ID, I'm asking how does a real person get a place to stay for the night, some fresh clothes and food.</p>  <p>Let's also assume that I AM actually paying for it, somehow, though I don't have cash or a credit card.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p> 
11234	Can you expect the flight attendants to tell the passenger in front of you to put his seat up in normal position?	<p>My last (Swiss) long-haul flight was overnight and a lot of passengers tried to sleep. Nevertheless, the flight crews served dinner at the start of the flight and breakfast shortly before landing. Both times, they woke up and asked the passenger in front of me to put his seat back into the upright position so that I could use my tray and eat my meal.</p>  <p>Is this a service I can expect from the flight crew of any airline, or is this not common?</p> 
18126	Where can I socialize with young Japanese people?	<p>One of the things I like about travelling to Japan is that it's possible, if you know some Japanese, to travel to destinations where your fellow travellers are predominantly domestic travellers, rather than from your own country. I enjoy having a two hour breakfast talking to fellow travellers, late nights in an izakaya, or talking in English to schoolchildren at a museum. The problem is, most people I meet are either schoolchildren or retirees!</p>  <p>Outside of public holiday periods like Golden Week, what destinations within Japan have a large proportion of travellers who are Japanese, and in their twenties and thirties? Preferably not overwhelmingly male.</p> 
10060	Is it possible or recommended to exchange US currency for Chinese currency outside China?	<p>I'll be traveling to China soon, specifically to Wuhan, and I remember reading somewhere (I don't remember where, unfortunately) that it's only possible to exchange USD for RMB in China itself - is that true?</p>  <p>Or if not, is it just a much better idea to do the exchange in China for some reason, e.g. exchange rates?</p>  <p>And a bonus question: can I expect to find a trustworthy English-speaking exchange agent at the airport in Beijing, where I have a layover, or in Wuhan?</p> 
14280	Ship items back home while traveling?	<p>I am starting a trip around the world today! and my bag looks pretty full already. I am wondering were I will put new clothes/items if I decide to buy some while I am traveling.</p>  <p>Has anyone ever sent things back home (to the USA) in order to make room for new stuff? Which services have you used?  I checked FedEx but they charge about $700 for a 6 Kg pack from Japan. Are there any economical/best options?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
9980	Low cost airlines search engine?	<p>With wheretowhen.com dying a few years ago and, now, airninja.com having become a regular (non-budget) flight search engine, is there any website left which lists the routes of budget airlines and makes them easily searchable?</p>  <p>Note that something like hipmunk (though excellent) isn't applicable, as most low cost airlines don't show up on hipmunk (nor on most other flight search engines).</p> 
5167	Any travel booking sites that let you search for a mixed itinerary?	<p>Travel sites that search all the major air lines are a dime a dozen.  And in some localities, there are travel sites that at least pay lip service to searching major bus carriers.</p>  <p>But are there any travel sites that will search all major forms of transportation, and let you form a mixed itinerary? I'm thinking at least air, bus, and train.</p>  <p>For instance, if I want the cheapest way to get from Town A to Town B, I'd like options like:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Take Foo Bus Line from Town A to City Q</li>   <li>Fly Bar Airline from City Q to City Z</li>   <li>Take Baz Passenger Train from City Z to Town B</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>For bonus points, it might even include public transit options, in localities where it's actually feasible to take public transit between major cities.</p> 
13966	When a mother travels with baby (2 years) without father, what documents she needs to have for baby?	<p>My wife wants to travel to another country for one month and would like to take our baby with her. We currently live in the USA, but are originally from Ukraine. The baby has a child travel document with a valid USA visa. </p>  <p>Question: Does my wife need to have any additional documents for the baby so she can travel without the father? In Ukraine we would need a written agreement from the father to allow my wife to fly with the baby, but what about in the USA? </p> 
10824	Inexpensive eating-out food in western Europe	<p>In Asian cities (including modern/first-world cities such as Singapore), there are a lot of food centers which sell decent, but very inexpensive food. For example, in Singapore they are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre">Hawker Centres</a>. It is very common throughout the city, and the food can be as low as costing only $3 (I would say, 1/5 of a meal in mid-range restaurants, and maybe almost equal the cost of cooking it on your own). It is very convenient if you don't want to spend a lot for eating out, yet you don't want to spend a lot of time cooking.</p>  <p>So far I haven't found anything similar in Western Europeans (or North American) major cities. There are some food shop and stalls which are somewhat cheaper than restaurants, but the difference is not as big as restaurants vs hawker centres. </p>  <p>Is there something analogous to this in Western Europe? If not, why? There must also be people who don't want to always eat out at expensive restaurants, yet also prefer not to have to cook? </p> 
9747	Baggage allowance of separate domestic flights with a connecting international flight?	<p>In the US, is there such a rule so that, if you are taking a domestic flight and then taking an international flight, the luggage allowance of the international flight will apply? Because it is quite possible you are taking a flight from a small airport to a big airport, and then catch your international flight.</p>  <p>Do all Airlines have the same regulations? Is there such a rule imposed by the government?</p> 
10957	How can you protect a fragile object like bottle of champagne in your baggage against breaking?	<p>I tend to bring something quite fragile with me as cabin luggage. On my next journey I want to bring a special bottle of champagne (because of sentimental reasons). Unfortunately you can't bring a bottle with you as cabin luggage.</p>  <p>I already know that it is okay to bring a bottle of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10928/is-it-okay-to-bring-a-bottle-of-champagne-on-an-airplane-as-checkin-luggage">champagne</a> as check-in luggage (even confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KLM/status/275517290571788288">the airline (Dutch)</a>.)  I am wondering how you can transport a bottle of champagne in your luggage in such a way it doesn't break easily.</p> 
7442	Flight/booking code explanation	<p>What do the letters mean in the following output from <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/search.htm">http://matrix.itasoftware.com/search.htm</a> search results?  </p>  <p>When I went to see a travel agent to book one of these flights, he mentioned the letter as shown in the screenshot below and implied that it was of some significance but failed to explain what it means or how it works.  </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QusVh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
8564	What are the best seat places to choose inside an international flight for economy class?	<p>Considering that I can choose any seat on any seat row on a Boeing 777-300ER for an international flight, I have most of 400 seat places to choose from the forefront to the last row of <a href="http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/KLM/KLM_Boeing_777-300ER.php">this airplane</a>. What are the best options if I bought an economy class ticket, traveling in a group of 4 people and if I want two windows? Are there any advantages in choosing the last places instead of the front ones?</p> 
5304	Seating plans on airplanes	<p>I just web checked in for my next flight. Out of curiosity I checked the seating plane. Normally, all the rows have 6 seats. 3 on the right side and 3 on the left side. But some rows have only 2 seats on each side. What could be the reason for that? And would these seats be a good or a bad choice?</p> 
6306	Is it possible to rent a car in one US state and drop it off in another?	<p>I'm from the UK and I'm looking at planning a road trip around the US with some friends. I wondered if it was possible to rent a car in one state but drop it off in another.</p>  <p>If it's possible do they charge more for hiring this way? Are there some states that don't allow this to happen?</p> 
4632	How to deal with excess baggage?	<p>I might have some excess bagage on my next flight with KLM.

5351	What section of an airplane offers the smoothest ride?	<p>I know in a bus, for instance, (well, at least on a school bus, when I traveled to out-of-town basketball games in high school) the farther back you are, the bumpier your ride tends to be. Is there a similar situation when a vehicle is airborne?</p>  <p>For the quietest ride, you clearly want to sit away from the engines.  But I'm curious if there is a part of the airplane that offers the smoothest ride.  That is, most free from vibrations during flight, or during take-off and landing.</p>  <p>I imagine the answer may be different for aircraft that have their engines mounted on the tail versus those with the engines mounted on the wings.  And maybe other factors play into the equation as well.</p> 
20311	Leaving Schengen region to reset 90 days	<p>I have a friend who claims that you can leave the Schengen area for 1 night, and re-enter, to reset your 90 days.  For example, an Australian could enter Europe and then go for a couple of nights holiday to Morocco, Andorra, or London (any place outside of Schengen), and then return to Paris and have the passport stamped for another 90 days stay in Europe.  They swear by this and claim they know guys doing it for years.  My understanding, which admittedly is just from reading online and not real-world experience, was that we could only spend 90 days out of any 180 days in the Schengen region.  </p>  <p>I've also heard other people say, no, you can't do that and if you are caught overstaying then you can be banned from re-entering schengen region for 5 years.  But, I've heard similar stories from several other people about leaving for 1 night making me think there is something to this story even if it's a loophole or a legal grey area (e.g. maybe the person checking at the border when you re-enter has to actually notice a previous stamp in your passport?)</p>  <p>So what are the real rules and facts about tourists staying in the Schengen region on these visa waiver agreements?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
1987	One-way tickets into the US and Canada?	<p>So I have a series of weird flights I can use to get to Bangkok from London with a stop in Vancouver, where it may actually be cheaper for me to fly to Vancouver, bus down to LA/San Fran, and then fly to Bangkok, or fly to LA, bus to Vancouver and then fly to Bangkok.   </p>  <p>Regardless, I've been told there may be problems with a one-way ticket into the US or Canada.  Would it be enough to simply buy a greyhound ticket to show you're leaving the country to your new destination?</p>  <p>Eg:</p>  <p>Fly LON->Vancouver, with greyhound tickets to get me to Los Angeles (or a short flight, yet to decide).</p>  <p>Fly LA to Bangkok.</p>  <p>Presumably in this case I'd simply need to show my onward ticket for each country, be it plane or bus?</p>  <p>(New Zealand passport)</p> 
14297	Is it possible to travel on cargo airplanes?	<p>Some time ago I heard someone telling about travelling in cargo planes.

Is that still possible? </p>

8139	Oyster Card - how does it actually work?	<p>I have heard about the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14836.aspx" rel="nofollow">Oyster Card</a> for London transportation network. You top it up with cash or credit card, and then you just swipe it in buses, subway, trains, and also when you leave the subway or train station. This way you are supposed to pay the lowest fare possible. </p>  <p>I wonder, is it really more cost effective, than daily or monthly tickets?</p> 
9266	Will I be able to enter South Korea as a tourist with a one-way ticket and no ticket home yet?	<p>I've been to South Korea a few times already and always enjoy it but I've always had an onward ticket before.</p>  <p>Now I need to fly home from a trip that's lasted over a year, but I still want to take my time and keep my options open.</p>  <p>There's a good choice of cheap flights from Istanbul to Seoul and from Seoul I can't decide yet whether to fly straight home or take a ferry to China, hitchhike to Guangzhou, and get a cheap flight home from there.</p>  <p>I can't really just buy the China-Australia flight now because I'm not sure yet whether I'll be able to get the Chinese visa easily enough or how long my remaining money will last.</p>  <p><strong>I know Korea, like most countries, has rules saying you need an onward ticket</strong>, but in my experience <strong>many countries never try to verify that you have this ticket</strong> unless you fit some profile. So in this instance I would find <strong>first-hand knowlegde</strong> much more informative that pointers to a government website.</p>  <p><strong>In practice does South Korea admit tourists with one-way tickets?</strong></p> 
20334	Is travelling as an international courier still a possibility for cheap air travel?	<p>Many years ago when I first started travelling, one of the tips you heard for a great way to get cheap international air tickets was to travel as a courier carrying items for specialized courier companies.</p>  <p>I don't think these were companies like DHL or FedEx but I think they were proper companies complying with all relevant regulations and were not regarded as something sketchy or dodgy.</p>  <p>The idea was that you carried personally on the plane something fragile or important to be delivered in the other country. This counted as part of your on-board luggage so you couldn't bring anything or could bring less on board of your own stuff. I'm not sure if checked luggage was also ever used. In return you got a free ticket or a ticket at greatly reduced cost.</p>  <p>But now I haven't heard of this travel option for years. Did it disappear due to changing rules after international terrorism? Or does it still exist? Does it only exist in some places?</p> 
19955	How useful/important is French in Montreal?	<p>I'm going to be in Montreal for several weeks-months for work this fall. I don't speak a word of French. It's my understanding that Montreal is the primary anglophone enclave for Quebec and that English is widely spoken. I've also been told that once you get outside of the Montreal metro area, English fluency drops off considerably.</p>  <p>My concerns are twofold:</p>  <ol> <li><p>While I'm not concerned with people not speaking English in, say, bars and restaurants and convenience stores, I am a little worried about getting yelled at angrily in French while working in an outer suburb and not having any clue how to respond. (I work in public spaces, and drive a vehicle with a graphic wrap from my employer that attracts attention, both positive and negative). Alternately, I tend to like local dive bars and off the beaten track restaurants that might not be used to catering to travelers. Should I be concerned? I understand that the city proper will be fine, but I'm wondering just how far out from the city that advice remains useful.</p></li> <li><p>Would it be useful for me to try to learn some rudimentary French before going? Would it make a difference? Or just be wasted effort. I do know enough to know that Parisian french is just different enough to be of reduced helpfulness.</p></li> </ol> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
5312	How to successfully haggle / bargain in markets	<p>While I've done quite a bit of travel now and back myself to handle situations when it comes to border guards, sorting accommodation and / or transportation, one thing I still struggle to come to terms with is haggling in the markets, be it for food, clothing or other.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FImXq.jpg" alt="Image of haggling in a market"></p>  <p>Image © Peter Morgan, 2014 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmorgan/62563356</a></p>  <p>What is the best way to go about this?

18920	How to find coworker space in Berlin as a tourist?	<p>I will be traveling to Berlin, where I will meet with some friends.

10289	How do Eurolines compare to IDBus for the London ↔ Paris route?	<p>As well as the usual options of Fly, Train (Eurostar), or drive/train + ferry + drive/train, there are now two coach operators running quite a few services between London and Paris. <a href="http://www.eurolines.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Eurolines</a> have been running for quite some time, and there's the new <a href="http://www.idbus.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">IDBus</a> which is currently advertising pretty heavily in London and Paris.</p>  <p>How do they compare though? I guess the main comparison points of interest would be:</p>  <ul> <li>Price - both lowest, and variability</li> <li>Travel time</li> <li>Frequency of departures</li> <li>Comfort of seats</li> <li>Wifi, power etc</li> <li>Onward connection possibilities</li> <li>luggage restrictions</li> </ul>  <p>(IDBus has to win though on "which bus company provides free wifi to parts of Lille Europe station while dropping off and picking up passengers", which I found handy earlier!)</p> 
20402	How do you find quiet and well-equipped places to work in cities when travelling?	<p>Sometimes, on business trips, I might be going to a meeting with customer for half the day, say. If my flight is not till the evening, I may want to find a quiet place to work on my laptop for several hours. I often tend to head for coffee shops, which have the advantage of coffee (!), but the following disadvantages:</p>  <ol> <li><p>They are often not even slightly quiet - noisy coffee machines, other people talking, etc.</p></li> <li><p>I feel a moral obligation (even if it's partly in my head!) to keep buying coffee, pastries, etc., which isn't good for the waistline or wallet.</p></li> <li><p>Some may not have good or any wifi, and it may be hard to find a power socket.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Assuming that I'm doing this on a budget (claiming back temporary office space such as <a href="http://www.regus.co.uk">Regus</a> is a non-starter), what other typical alternatives exist for finding quiet, comfortable, ideally free or cheap working space in a city for a few hours?</p>

14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days. I have already got visitor's visa for the same on my Indian passport. Particulars mentioned on my visa are:  1. 'Etats Schengen' , 2. Single entry 3. Dates of visit. &amp; 4. Type of visa : C.  I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p>

20558	Are there any guest houses close to the Buddha Park in Vientiane, Laos?	<p>In a recent question I was looking for <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/20495/day-trip-or-weekend-trip-from-vientiane-laos">day trips or weekend trips near Vientiane</a>.</p>  <p>One of the very good answers was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_Park" rel="nofollow">Buddha Park (Wat Xieng Khuan)</a>, which is about 25 km from Vientiane.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJevI.jpg" alt="Reclining Buddha at Wat Xieng Khuan"></p>  <p>Now one of the reasons for a day or weekend trip is to get away from the "big" city and relax somewhere quiet for a day or two.</p>  <p>So far I haven't been able to locate any guest house, hostel, or other cheap accommodation near the Buddha Park and not near Vientiane itself. I don't mind places that don't specifically cater to foreigners or tourists.

I can make Schengen visa but I need at least 9 days and I am leaving tomorrow! <br /><br /> <strong>Edit: GenDec</strong> <br /> IF you do not know what is the "General Declaration (GenDec or GD)" it is a form that has all names of crew members on-board an aircraft/ship which is issued by the carrier and has to be signed by the crew members and will be handled to the immigration authority at the destination. This GenDec will grant the access to the crew members. Most countries will allow the crew to access just by the GenDec (Including Europe) some requires crew to have their own crew visas (USA, China...). </p>

I have already got visitor's visa for the same on my Indian passport. Particulars mentioned on my visa are:  1. 'Etats Schengen' , 2. Single entry 3. Dates of visit. &amp; 4. Type of visa : C.  I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p> 
8300	Travel from Thailand to Vietnam through Laos - good idea?	<p>I'm trying to plan a trip route which include traveling from north Thailand to Vietnam. Since I don't have a strict time limitation, I thought that maybe instead of taking a flight I could travel by land through Laos. Now I'd like to ask if someone already done such trip? How much time such a route could take? What are the available transportations options? Is it safe?</p>  <p>Currently what I had in mind (according to some internet research), is to travel from Chiang Mai to Vientiane via Friendship Bridge (As I understood this is a Thanaleng crossing) and then continue to Luang Prabang. I've found few posts regarding the available routes from Luang Prabang to Vietnam <a href="http://www.travelfish.org/board/post/laos/8413_trip-from-luang-prabang-to-sapa-to-hanoi" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa;jsessionid=9F1DBAB136AF6998C575E57BC30A6560.app01?threadID=1795975&amp;messageID=16307838#16307838" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So I guess I'll just have to choose one of them and hope that I'll be able to make all the arrangements when I'm there. </p>  <p>Any other tips\ideas are more than welcome.</p> 
16374	Traveling from Thailand to Laos to Vietnam	<p>This summer I'm planning to go to Thailand, Laos and then through to Vietnam. I know very little about this. I was wondering if somebody would be able to tell me if this could be done comfortably and affordably in 3 1/2  weeks. I would appreciate it if they could also give me some ideas about the route.</p>  <p>I am flying from the UK to Thailand where I hope to get the rest of the way by ground. I am really interested in visiting Vaing Vieng and Luang Probang and then take the Mekong river and visit Hoi An, Nah Trang and Ho Chi Minh City. I know little about South East Asia and would really appreciate some help.</p> 
8289	How to get to Siem Reap (Angkor Wat) from Pakse by land?	<p>If I'm in the south of Laos and would like to go to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Siem_Reap" rel="nofollow">Siem Reap</a>, what are my options by land? (include river boat if necessary in my 'by land' definition).</p>  <p>I've found one which is going from Pakse to Stueng Traeng and then connecting with Siem Reap, both by bus. That means taking two buses and wasting more than 10 hours (5+5 hours + waiting time and delays) and possibly having to sleep in Stueng Traeng where there is nothing interesing.</p>  <p>So, is there an alternative? I mean, is there a more direct way to get to Siem Reap that makes it sure that it can be done in one day (no overnight) or a city where I could stop that is worth a visit?</p>

Either because you have a lot planned for the day or you're catching long distance bus / train, you've to get up really early in the morning. The showers either don't have hot water or it doesn't work. It's cold and you <em>really</em> don't want to stand under a stream of freezing cold water.</p>  <p>Not really a hypothetical scenario because I've been there, done that, got the t-shirt. So what's your travel tip for when you're travelling and find no place to shower?</p> 
20639	How to hide your bodily odors after a long flight?	<p>Of course I could fly first class on an airline that provide on-board showers. Since I lack the funds, that is not an option for me. </p>  <p>The scenario is as follows:</p>  <p>Your plane leaves in the evening. During the day you just enjoy the city, but it appears to be just a bit more sunny than you expected. Since you already checked out from your hotel, you are not able to take a shower before heading for the airport. At the airport, the showers are unavailable due to technicalities. You then buy some tax-free aftershave to freshen up. You then have a 12 hour flight, after which  you have to transfer between terminals in a packed bus while it is 30 degrees Celsius. When you board your connecting flight, you realize that a cocktail of 24 hours of dried sweat and 12 hours dried aftershave just do not add up and that the people sitting next to you on the connecting flight are going to have a very uncomfortable flight. </p>  <p>Is there anything you can do to prevent this awkward situation? </p>

5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
5000	How safe is travelling on European rail networks for solo travellers?	<p>How safe is travelling on European rail networks for solo travellers, including overnight trains? Obviously, the usual precautions of being more mindful of belongings when travelling solo need to be kept in mind. I'd also reckon that Western and Northern Europe would be relatively safer, but this is just an assumption.</p>  <p>What I'm specifically looking for is information or a resource that logs crime statistics for thefts, muggings, et al that happen on trains - across Europe, if possible but country-specific guides would also be useful. If this is not available, anecdotal or otherwise security information on any stretches of European rail networks to be careful about would also be helpful.</p>

But I want to spend some time working for my employer (remote work) and getting paid by the employer. Is this possible under a tourist visa (B1/B2)?</p>  <p>I hope this is OK since I will not be getting paid by a US employer. I am in the IT trade so all that I will be needing is my own laptop and a connection to the internet. The money I earn would actually help me pay for the expenses I get during the holiday.</p> 
13845	How do I minimize total cost of separate flights to the same destination plus optionally accommodation?	<p>My girlfriend and I are currently living in different countries, and meet occasionally for a few days every month or so. We don't really care all that much where we are going, as long as we don't need a visa (we're both in EU), just so we are at the same place and time for a couple of days. </p>  <p>In short:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I'm flying from airport <strong>AAA</strong>, she's flying from airport <strong>BBB</strong>, we need to find an airport <strong>XXX</strong> (not an euphemism!) which is cheapest to fly to overall.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Bonus task:</strong> Flights are first and foremost, and we could live with a somewhat more expensive accommodation as long as we can get in and out easily. Since the accommodation cost is comparable to flight cost for such a short stay, we'd like to have some sort of rough idea what we're going to pay for a certain type of accommodation, for example three-star hotel. </p>

I should be leaving at the first or second week of June and returning the end of July. </p>  <p>EDIT: I've been advised to clarify my question a bit. What I'm really interested in is ways to reduce the price of whatever I will have to pay, when is the best time of the fly, what sites should I look at to book with, what fees will I have to contend with, should I connect through a foreign country or try to go through the US only.</p>

I'd like to have an easy time getting to Heathrow Terminal 3 in the morning, and I have to be there by 8 AM for an international flight.</p>  <p>I am considering Paddington so I can take the Heathrow Express in the morning, but I'm concerned about this 15 minute elevator transfer between the Heathrow Express 1-3 stop and Terminal 3.  I want things to go as smoothly as possible.</p>  <p>I also don't know if there is somewhere along the Piccadilly line maybe Hammersmith or west of there that could get me to Heathrow quickly.  I don't know what any of these London neighborhoods are, so I don't know if any of them are suitable to stay and visit for one night.</p>  <p>We won't be doing any shopping, and don't really have time for sightseeing, unless there's someplace neat we can visit in one evening.</p>

It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p>

Mount Gassan (月山, literally "moon mountain") in Yamagata prefecture seems to be my best bet - it has a ski season of April to July, with the season opening determined not by when they first get snow, but when they can get rid of enough of it to open up the roads!</p>  <p>I asked the tourism information office of Mount Gassan, and they said that ski rental isn't available in Gassan itself. Are there other locations at which ski rental is available?</p>  <p>I anticipate going by shinkansen to Yamagata city, and hiring a car from there, so something in Yamagata city, or between Yamagata city and Gassan would be ideal.</p>  <p>As a fallback, I guess I could try hiring at Zao Onsen, but that's in the opposite direction from Yamagata city as Gassan is!</p> 
21041	Closest skiing to Indochina	<p>From a developed, connected part of SEA - oh, let's say, Thailand - where is the nearest skiing?   Mostly thinking of shortest travel time (eg, to go for a long weekend), but would also be interested in physically closest.</p>  <p>Japan jumped to mind, as I know there is skiing in Hokkaido. <br>I heard a rumor about a ski place in Burma, which would be interesting; when I tried to find information about it online, though, I only come up with references to plans/ideas to develop a fairly remote mountain (Hkakabo Razi) that don't seem near fruition.</p>  <p>Ideally, information about the development-level, difficulty, and approximate costs of the place(s) would be great.   <br>(I imagine that anywhere in Japan is going to be developed to a typical US/EU standard, maybe on the easy side (groomers), and fairly pricey.  Once upon a time, I read about skiing in Kashmir with pack-mules for 'chairlifts' - which would be interesting, although maybe too remote for a short trip.)</p> 
7180	Key vs. combo lock security for international travel	<p>I leave on my trip next month, and I wanted to buy locks for my backpack since I'll certainly be passing through crowded areas of the city where it may be difficult for me to notice a pickpocket attempt. What I want to know, is whether a key or combo lock offers a higher level of security over the other. Also, would anyone know where I might be able to purchase a set of 4-5 locks that unlock with a single key?</p> 
2764	How useful or necessary is a pacsafe for your backpack?	<p>I will be taking a backpacking trip through SE Asia, South Africa and South America for an extended period of time.</p>  <p>I am taking a 36L backpack, and trying to bring as few things as possible. However, I will be carrying a laptop, DSLR camera and some other electronic gear so that I can work while traveling.</p>  <p><strong>Is a pacsafe, or something else that surrounds your backpack for security reasons, a necessary or useful item that would warrant the extra space and weight in my pack?</strong></p> 
21075	How long does my passport have to be valid for a layover in the US?	<p>On Wednesday I'll be flying from Amsterdam to Canada (Saskatoon), there is a layover in the US (Minneapolis) for two hours (and obviously I'm not going to leave the airport). I know that for Canada, my passport has to be only valid for the time I'm staying there, but I don't know how this works for layovers and if it's even valid there?! I'm German, my passport expires on November 12th and I'll be leaving Canada on November 3rd (but directly back to mainland Europe, no layover in the US), so my passport is valid for a bit more than a month at the time of my layover.</p>  <p>So, basically: Should I panic about not being able to board the plane or can I go to bed and sleep without fear?</p> 
835	Extended stay visa for Germany	<p>I want to apply for an extended stay visa for Germany to visit a friend.  I want to visit beyond the 90 days that American can visit Schengen countries without going through an application process.  The German embassy website indicates that I need to fill out an on-line visa application form.  The form asks for the length of stay but indicates that a number greater than 90 days can't be entered.  I'm also asked to provide a copy of a plane reservation but I don't want to buy a plane ticket without knowing if I can stay longer than 90 days.  </p>  <p>Does anyone have pointers for navigating the process?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  After some digging around I found from the <a href="http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/05__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Permanent__Residence__Visa.html">German Embassy Website</a> that anyone who wishes to stay in Germany more than 90 days must obtain a residence permit.  This information was hard to find because it is only stated in the section that deals with permanent residence.  From the website:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Citizens of the United States of America, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, as well as EU citizens may apply for their residence permit after entering Germany without a visa.</p> </blockquote> 
8105	Is it easy to get prepaid SIMs in the US/Canada?	<p>I'll be travelling in a family party to the east coast of the US and Canada and, as most people know, travelling in a party means you often need to keep in contact when seeing different things and trying to meet up, etc.  We were wondering if it's easy to get prepaid SIMs for our (Australian) phones and use them while we were over there?  </p>  <p>Are there any catches to be aware of?  Can the same SIMs be used for Canada (Toronto) and the US, or should we just restrict ourselves to US-only ones?  What about data quotas for smart phones?</p> 
6251	Which prepaid sim to get to use my unlocked iPhone 4 in the US	    <p>I'll be living in the US for 6 months soon and I'm looking for a way to use my unlocked iPhone 4 on a pay-as-you-go plan with data. Do you guys know anything good?</p> 
1677	Are there data plans for travelers in the USA?	<p>I intend to travel to the US for a month, and I would really like to use a lot of data traffic during the trip, for browsing, maps, Skype calls, etc. How can I do that? Should I buy a SIM? Do I have to order one in advance, or are data SIMs readily available in the airport? Is there any website that can show me competing options and maybe compare them?</p>  <p>Also, I guess SIMs are linked to one specific carrier. Does it matter which cellular carrier I choose, or do all have similar coverage and do all support GSM phones? Does it change from state to state? e.g. do some of the more states, like Hawaii, have limited coverage for some of the carriers?</p>  <p>In short I am clueless here, and would really appreciate any information about this.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: meanwhile I have found <a href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">this comparison between various data sim suppliers</a>, seems very useful though I'm not sure how reliable or up-to-date this page is.</p> 
1901	What happens if RFID system in my "biometric" travel passport malfunctions when I cross the border?	<p>My travel passport contains the "biometric" RFID chip. While I can at any moment check that my passport itself is intact (not torn or anything) I can't check whether the chip inside is functioning as expected and whether the antenna used for powering it is intact.</p>  <p>Suppose I'm trying to cross the border and my passport is attempted to be accessed via RFID and the RFID system in my passport malfunctions. Now what? Am I denied entry?</p> 
17013	Long layover in Heathrow	<p>I'm an Indian passport holder with a valid US visa. I have an 18 hour layover in Heathrow. With a land side transit visa can I go out of the airport just to check into a nearby hotel to get some rest? Or is that visa ONLY for transiting between Gatwick and Heathrow? </p>  <p>Really appreciate a response from someone who has had this experience as I cannot find anywhere if the purpose of this visa is just for going between airports. In which case I have go thru the hassle of getting a visitors visa just for a few hrs</p> 
20162	Long layover at Charles de Gaulle airport	<p>I have a 23 hours layover at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. I don't have a Schengen visa. Any advice for a bit of comfort. </p> 
7695	Layover at Tokyo Narita airport: can I travel outside, and what kind of visa would I need?	<p>I am traveling from Singapore to San Francisco and an airline which I am choosing has a layover of 7.5 hours at Tokyo Airport (NRT). I am wondering if I would be allowed to go out to experience the city for a while in some form a visitor visa.  I know, Singapore has such facilities, but does anyone know if I can do something similar in Tokyo? Any suggestions or pointers are welcome. Note - I do not have a visa for Japan yet, but I am hoping that 1 day visitor visa could be possible at airport.</p> 
4330	Getting nauseated from air travel, but it's *not* motion sickness...what to do?	<p>My sister is not particularly inclined to air travel—she regularly throws up, and the feeling of nausea is evident well before motion sickness could occur (i.e. inside the terminal). </p>  <p>I suspect some of it is due to a reverse-placebo psychological effect—she likely associated motion sickness with airports/airplanes/air travel at an early age and it's unfortunately carried through. It's probably not entirely the odor of burnt jet-fuel (although she does mention that as contributing) since she's fine when she's going to the airport to say bye to relatives. </p>  <p>Also of note—my sister is only 11 years old, so that limits what can be done to help her as far as medication is concerned.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, neither Dramamine, Benadryl, nor Sea-Bands have been of any help, as we discovered two days ago. We're going to consult her doctor when we get back to the US, but the slight problem with that is that there is a 12 hour plane ride back to the US, and the preferable option would be to go back with as little vomit as possible.</p>  <p>What could be done to help alleviate her nausea?</p> 
21185	Cheapest flight generally from Ulan Bator to a country an Australian citizen doesnt need a full page visa for?	<p>My current goal on this trip is to get to Ulan Bator, Mongolia but the Mongolian visa will use up the last blank page of my passport and I intend to keep travelling for a couple months more.</p>  <p>So yes I know I might be able to obtain a new passport at the Australian embassy in UB but I don't mind the restriction and am considering my options.</p>  <p>I'm interested in everywhere, the only restrictions are the generally cheapest flight, and the destination has to be a place where Australians don't need a visa, or where the visa-on-arrival does not take up a full page. (USA is also out as I happen to require a visa there.)</p>  <p>I know flight prices change and there are changing special offers etc so I'm not looking for the absolute cheapest, just the destination which should pretty much always be available and pretty much always be cheap. If the cheapest is still not super cheap it's still an acceptable answer.</p>  <p>Experience will probably provide the best answer since if none of us are familiar with flight prices out of Mongolia we'll be able to find current cheap flights on the flight search engines, but it will be harder to know for sure which of those destinations are usually the cheap ones and which are seasonal or special prices.</p>  <p><sup>(For example there might be cheaper flights sometimes but generally the cheapest places to fly from Sydney are Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.)</sup></p> 
20184	Are Australian passports expensive in comparison to other western / developed countries?	<p>I decided not to renew my passport before starting this trip because passports are very expensive in comparison to my income and my low travel budget.</p>  <p>But when asking people I find their passports in other countries are much more affordable than in my country. Typically Australian passports are in the range of roughly double the price friends have to pay in other developed countries or other western countries.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Ordinary adult passport:<br> <code>AUD</code> $238  (<code>USD</code> $212; <code>EUR</code> 161)</p></li> <li><p>Adult frequent traveller with more pages:<br> <code>AUD</code> $358  (<code>USD</code> $320; <code>EUR</code> 243)</p></li> </ul>  <p>Is this a rip-off? Are most passports in "rich" countries so expensive or are they roughly half the price as the impression I have so far?</p>  <hr>  <p>It's true I overlooked passport validity. That's the most important thing I've learned with this question. Assuming all passports have the same number of "visa pages" I should instead ask what the <strong>"price per year or decade of validity"</strong> is.</p> 
19939	Will I need a transit visa for transit in Stockholm in a trip from Turkey to Russia?	<p>I have a flight from Istanbul (Turkey) to Saint Petersburg in Russia. I have two nationalities </p>  <p>I booked my ticket on my Syrian passport because I entered Turkey with it, and I will carry my Russian passport with me to enter Russia.</p>  <p>My flight is from Istanbul to Stockholm then after 3 hours I will change the plan to heading to Saint Petersburg. </p>  <p>Shall I need a transit visa for three hours in Stockholm?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
6767	How to get a tax refund for computer accessories purchased on a visit to USA?	<p>I am about to buy two Mac accessories in the Apple Store in Manhattan which cost a total of $98 before tax.</p>  <p>I would like to get a refund for the tax before I get back to Europe.</p>  <p>My question is what should I ask from the cashier in the Apple Store, and what should I do in the Newark/JFK airport.</p>  <p>I found <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k3036773-Tax_Refund_in_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html" rel="nofollow">a post on TripAdvisor</a>, but it is a bit ambivalent. </p> 
21236	Duration of Schengen visa while travelling to non Schengen areas which allow Schengen visa	<p>I'm planning to travel to the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Turkey. I'll be in Netherlands for 4 days, Bulgaria for 4 and Turkey for 2. I'm applying for a Schengen visa for the Netherlands. Considering that Bulgaria and Turkey are not in the Schengen Area (but accept Schengen Visas for entry), will the duration of the visa be determined by only the Netherlands leg of the trip? Ideally I would want the visa to be valid for at least 10 days to include the entire trip.</p> 
13242	Single/Multiple entry Schengen Visa for visiting Italy and Croatia	<p>I am from India, and I plan to visit Europe for a month. I will be starting with Switzerland, and then I plan to go to Croatia.  If I have a single entry Schengen Visa, go to Croatia, will I be allowed to enter back into a Schengen country (maybe Italy)? Or, do I need a multiple entry Schengen Visa?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p> 
5538	Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?	<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>  <p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p> 
21005	What is the difference between customs and immigration?	<p>Maybe this is a question that should be asked at <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com">english.se</a> in stead. I am just wondering if you can talk about "going through customs", when referring to all processes involved in entering/transferring a country. Or are the terms just as synonymous as <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9480/whats-the-difference-between-embassies-and-consulates">Consulates and Embassies</a>? </p> 
14675	Must I leave the Schengen Area to start a new 6 month period as a Canadian?	<p>I'm a Canadian, which is one of the visa waiver countries for the Schengen Area.</p>  <p>I understand the 90/180 day rule is based on your first arrival date, so the 180 day period is calculated from there.</p>  <p>If I entered the Schengen Area on January 1st of 2013, and stayed for two weeks, and then left, and then returned on June 1st and stayed until June 30th, I would have about 1.5 months used in that 180 day period. A new period should now start on July 1st, which should enable me to be there for another 90 days before requiring me to leave.</p>  <p>Am I correct in this? I think I am based on what I read here: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13183/about-schengen-90-180-rule">About Schengen 90/180 rule</a></p>  <p>But my <strong><em>real</em></strong> question is do I need to leave to a non-schengen state on June 30th, and then fly back immediately? Or can I just stay in the country I am for the new 90 days?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
9685	What external batteries can I get to charge a tablet during long road trips?	<p>So there is an external battery <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002K8M9HC">available at on Amazon</a>.</p>  <p>I'm just wondering though - would this only provide around 8 hours of additional power for most tablets? Are there any options that provide more than 8 hours of additional power? I use a Lenovo ThinkPad tablet. </p>  <p>The cars do have lighters that you can plug electric devices into, but if the charging rates are slower than they are at home, then the tablet would take a very long time to charge (and since it is a group field trip, the lighter charge would have to be shared). </p> 
1874	Which transportation is best from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport to Hua Hin?	<p>What is the most cost effective way to get from the Suvarnabhumi Airport to Hua Hin (on Thailand's northwestern Gulf coast)? And how much would that be compared to a taxi ride?</p> 
4091	What are the wild camping regulations in Iceland?	<p>I've read <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1340/where-is-wild-camping-possible-in-europe">here</a> that "<em>in Iceland you are allowed to do this by law as long as you stay away from houses and use common sense like you say</em>". Wild camping in Iceland is one of my ideas for the next summer. The question is what does it means "stay away from houses"? And what should be understand as "common sense"? For instance, if I rent a car to move along the island, may I stop at the side of the route with the car and camp? Of course, I'm not talking about the Ring Road. I'm thinking in secondary trails.</p>

Where is the snow?</p>  <p>What website or resource is most helpful in finding snow stats such as base depth, conditions, and predicted future conditions?</p>  <p>I am most interested in stats for US resorts (resorts in California, Utah &amp; Colorado, also, New York &amp; Vermont), but would be interested in resources that provide worldwide snow statistics, as well.</p> 
20402	How do you find quiet and well-equipped places to work in cities when travelling?	<p>Sometimes, on business trips, I might be going to a meeting with customer for half the day, say. If my flight is not till the evening, I may want to find a quiet place to work on my laptop for several hours. I often tend to head for coffee shops, which have the advantage of coffee (!), but the following disadvantages:</p>  <ol> <li><p>They are often not even slightly quiet - noisy coffee machines, other people talking, etc.</p></li> <li><p>I feel a moral obligation (even if it's partly in my head!) to keep buying coffee, pastries, etc., which isn't good for the waistline or wallet.</p></li> <li><p>Some may not have good or any wifi, and it may be hard to find a power socket.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Assuming that I'm doing this on a budget (claiming back temporary office space such as <a href="http://www.regus.co.uk">Regus</a> is a non-starter), what other typical alternatives exist for finding quiet, comfortable, ideally free or cheap working space in a city for a few hours?</p> 
14082	Is it possible to make a decent income from travelling the world?	<p>My dream is to be able to travel the world and have a new adventure every day. With the internet, every day I'm able to see this beautiful and unique world, but those are only photos. I want to experience those places and cultures.</p>  <p>There are some things, of course, I have to think about, and the one most important is <strong>income</strong>. How do I support myself while travelling the world? The first thing I think is <em>What are my talents?</em></p>  <p>I'm a software engineer and love everything about software and the open source world. I'm a hard gamer and love to play a variety of games. I have very little experience with video and photo editing (Photoshop and After Effects), but the little I had with that, I enjoyed it. <strong>How can I make a decent salary writing software while travelling the world?</strong></p>  <p>I've also thought about writing a blog about my day-to-day adventures, and maybe even making a Youtube channel with vlogs about my day-to-day adventures. If I were to do that, how successful do you think it would be? If it was, how well could that support me (or how much money do you think I can make)? I also thought about photography, and to take photos and to sell them online, if that's possible.</p>  <p>Of course, there are things that, as a normal citizen, I wouldn't have to pay like house payment (though I would be paying rent or for a hotel which may or may not be less), car payment (though I would rent cars when I needed to), home internet (I could use Wi-Fi at local shops if applicable), entertainment (most likely if I'm travelling the world, I will have less concern about what new movies or games are coming out), etc.</p>  <p>I make a pretty good salary and have GREAT benefits including health care, retirement, etc. For me, it would be hard to let go of those kind of things. Is it possible while travelling the world to get some sort of health care? I hate to sound negative, but what happens if I need surgery but can't afford it, could I not get health care? And how would I take care of my retirement? What happens when I'm old and decrepit and don't move around as well as now?</p>  <p>It's that time in my life where sitting behind a desk, 40 hours a week, 5 days a week just isn't cutting it. Has anybody here or anybody you know of attempted this? How successful were they?</p> 
9234	Valid Indian visa in an expired passport	<p>I recently had to renew my passport.  The expired one has an Indian visa that will be valid until 2016.

9277	Recommendation for prepaid SIM card in the Netherlands	<p>I will stay in the Netherlands for three months and I'm looking for a prepaid SIM card with a cheap data plan (like, 200 MB free per month). In Germany, there are lots and lots of offers like this, but due to my lack of Dutch I have not been able to find a website comparing plans.</p>  <p>Are there any websites which compare the plans, or any specific recommendations for certain plans? Websites in Dutch are fine, too.</p> 
17239	Do you need to submit an itinerary to get a Chinese visa? And do you have to stick to it?	<p>There are certain countries which in order to be granted a visa you must submit your intended itinerary. My friend tells me that he thinks China is one of those countries.</p>  <p>What do independent travellers do? We're thinking of hitch-hiking across China without a precise plan. But if we have to submit an itinerary for the visa does then lock us in to a planned route after all?</p>  <p>Is it just bureaucracy where they make it look complicated but in practice it turns out to be easy?</p>  <p>(If it makes a difference we will have Australia or UK passports.)</p>

Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
18126	Where can I socialize with young Japanese people?	<p>One of the things I like about travelling to Japan is that it's possible, if you know some Japanese, to travel to destinations where your fellow travellers are predominantly domestic travellers, rather than from your own country. I enjoy having a two hour breakfast talking to fellow travellers, late nights in an izakaya, or talking in English to schoolchildren at a museum. The problem is, most people I meet are either schoolchildren or retirees!</p>  <p>Outside of public holiday periods like Golden Week, what destinations within Japan have a large proportion of travellers who are Japanese, and in their twenties and thirties? Preferably not overwhelmingly male.</p> 
6751	Getting a SIM card (prepay) in India	<p>Unlike in the UK and most of the European countries (where one can buy a SIM over the counter in any of the shops), getting a SIM in India is a tedious process. One has to provide a copy of ID proof (both photo ID and an address proof) and then wait couple of hours, sometime one day to get the SIM activated. This doesn't seem to be a concern for an Indian resident as we can wait.</p>  <p>I am looking for information from tourists/visitors outside India who were on a short visit (tourist/business) and managed to get a cell connection. I would like to keep this information handy so that I can share it with my friends when they visit India. </p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
21498	AirBnB vs hostel near Manhattan? Is AirBnB very selective?	<p>I am looking for a hostel or a hostel alternative to stay in from Nov 11 - Nov 14th near Columbia.</p>  <p>I noticed some good suggestions in a previous thread: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/8288/8918">http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/8288/8918</a></p>  <p>AirBnB offers in the area are very competetive but <em>no one</em> seems to reply to my messages: I am brand new to AirBnB and that might be the reason why?</p>  <p>If a newb has no place on AirBnB, which hostel or a hostel alternative would be a good place to sleep?</p>  <p>It's just a place to rest at night and have my suitcase (it will contain expensive research equipment from school) safe during the day when I am out exploring the city</p> 
1930	Does an EU citizen need a visa to visit Australia for holidays?	<p>Is a visa required, or is just a passport enough, for a short holiday trip to Australia? </p>  <p>Specifically, how is it for citizens of Nordic EU member countries such as Finland? </p> 
19939	Will I need a transit visa for transit in Stockholm in a trip from Turkey to Russia?	<p>I have a flight from Istanbul (Turkey) to Saint Petersburg in Russia. I have two nationalities </p>  <p>I booked my ticket on my Syrian passport because I entered Turkey with it, and I will carry my Russian passport with me to enter Russia.</p>  <p>My flight is from Istanbul to Stockholm then after 3 hours I will change the plan to heading to Saint Petersburg. </p>  <p>Shall I need a transit visa for three hours in Stockholm?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
13964	How soon can I re-enter the USA having stayed for 90 days under the Visa waiver programme? I am a UK citizen	<p>I am currently visiting the USA from the UK (I am a UK citizen) and am intending on staying here for the full 90 days under the Visa Waiver programme. How long would I have to stay out of the US at the end of this period before returning again? Would I have to return to the UK, or could I stay with friends in another country (such as Canada) for a while?</p>

18955	Cheapest place to fly from China, Taiwan, or Southeast Asia to Ishigaki, Japan?	<p>I'm pondering meeting up with a friend in Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan on my upcoming trip.</p>  <p>I'll be on a tight budget hitchhiking from Singapore to China with no real plan or itinerary so any departure airport along that route or even Taiwan would be suitable - if the price is low!</p>  <p>It seems that flight search engines sometimes make it easy to find flights to anywhere in a country, but when I would fly from anywhere in China to one specific airport I can't find any easy way to search.</p>  <p>In fact I don't even know which airlines and routes service Ishigaki but I suppose that will be easier to find.</p>

21469	Why are prices published without tax in the US?	<p>On a recent trip to San Francisco it was always a surprise to see what to pay in stores. It was never as simple as just adding all the published prizes. There was always a surplus of taxes. Sometimes it was just an additional 50ct, but sometimes the increase in prize was substantial. The most extreme case being a bag of apples with a publised price of 1.99 but a final price of 4.50. Isn't there a single VAT and how can I know the prize to expect? If the taxes apply to everyone, why not simply publish the price including taxes?</p> 
9418	Will a UAE stamp in my passport cause problems entering Israel?	<p>I will be traveling to Israel soon and am concerned because some colleagues have suggested that the visa stamps in my passport from the United Arab Emirates (eg Dubai) might cause me difficulties on arrival. </p>  <p>Is this something I should be worried about?

19478	Travel implications when going to Muslim countries after a visit to Israel	<p>I would like to visit Israel, but I have heard that if you visit some Muslim countries, they won't let you in, and visa versa.</p>  <p>Does it depend on which Muslim countries?  I imagine there would be different policies say between Egypt and Iran.  Does the order of visit matter?  How can 'they' tell you have been to a particular country, is it by the stamps in your passport or what?</p>  <p>I am on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>I have visited Malaysia and Indonesia (Bali) in the past (with a stamp in my current passport)</p>  <p>I would like to visit Israel.</p>  <p>I would like to visit the following Muslim/Middle eastern countries:</p>  <p>Egypt, Jordan (Petra), Turkey, Malaysia again.</p> 
18920	How to find coworker space in Berlin as a tourist?	<p>I will be traveling to Berlin, where I will meet with some friends. We would like to have a hackathon which means doing computer work for which we would need an Internet connection, a whiteboard and space where discussions would not disturb others trying to work. </p>  <p>In Paris there is <a href="http://lacantine.org" rel="nofollow">La Cantine</a>, which is exactly what I am looking for. A sort of cafe, where the objective is to work and where you can just enter when you are a tourist needing to do some work. I try to google for coworker space in Berlin, but only get places that offer monthly subscriptions for shared office space. </p>  <p>We only need a place to work for one day and none of us is living in Berlin. </p> 
20332	Arrivals forms or customs agents may ask if you packed your own bags. Must I pack them myself or is it OK to answer in the negative to this question?	<p>When arriving in some countries you must fill out an arrival form at customs and immigration. You may also be asked some questions by customs agents.</p>  <p>In some countries one question is whether or not you packed your own bags.</p>  <ul> <li>Must everybody always answer "yes" to this question. Do I have to pack all of my own stuff?</li> <li>Is it illegal to carry anything somebody else packed?</li> <li>Or is it OK to say "no" about items I didn't pack and then those items get handled by a separate procedure?</li> </ul>  <p>I'm asking this generically rather than about a single country on purpose. If you can provide evidence that at least two countries behave differently then give that as an answer and I will ask a new question about one specific country.</p>  <hr>  <p>As an epilogue, I was partly wondering in the case of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/20334/is-travelling-as-an-international-courier-still-a-possibility-for-cheap-air-trav">if you were travelling as an air courier</a>, but then I realized I didn't even know if that existed anymore so I asked two independent questions.</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p> 
2017	Should US citizens get a visa in advance for a one-week trip to Hong Kong?	<p>I'm US Citizen and I'm planing a one week trip to Hong Kong for pleasure. Do I need to get a visa in advance?</p>  <p>This <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1136.html">site</a> seems to indicate that I do not need to as long as I have a passport that is valid for at least 6 months.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>ENTRY/EXIT REQUIREMENTS: FOR U.S. CITIZENS:</strong> To enter Hong Kong, you will need a passport that is valid for at least one month beyond the date of your intended stay, adequate funds to cover your stay without working locally, and evidence of onward/return transportation. Many neighboring areas require that your passport is valid for at least six months before they will allow you to enter, so if you plan on regional travel beyond Hong Kong, make sure that your passport is valid for at least six months beyond the date you plan to enter such areas. You do not need a visa for tourist visits of up to 90 days. You may be granted an extension of your stay if you apply to the Hong Kong SAR Immigration Department. You must have an appropriate visa to work or study in Hong Kong. Visit the Hong Kong SAR Immigration Department or the Embassy of the People's Republic of China website for the most current visa information.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, if anyone knows otherwise i would appreciate a heads up.</p> 
18862	Is there a cheaper (slower) way to get by train from Brussels to Paris than Thalys?	<p>I'm wondering if there is a cheaper way to get from Brussels to Paris by train than Thalys. Thalys prices are alright if you book some time in advance, but it can be quite expensive if you book only a few days before. I don't mind if the travel time takes some extra hours.</p>  <p>This is related to the question “<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13731/what-is-the-cheapest-fastest-way-to-get-from-brussels-to-paris">What is the cheapest / fastest way to get from Brussels to Paris?</a>” but no one mentioned other options by train than Thalys there.

11158	Puerto Rico visa (or visa waiver) requirements for EU citizens	<p>For a short-term holiday visit to Puerto Rico, <strong>is a visa, or visa waiver, required for EU citizens</strong>? (Finnish citizens, if it makes a difference.)</p>  <p>I'd <em>guess</em> it's one of these (given PR's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico#Political_status">special status</a> as a US territory but not a state):</p>  <ol> <li><p>Like US "proper", where you'd need the <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">visa waiver / ESTA</a> sorted beforehand (pay $14, answer interesting questions about your 1930-40s Nazi connections, etc).</p></li> <li><p>Like most Latin American countries, where generally a visa is not required for Europeans (or you can easily get a tourist card upon arrival).</p></li> </ol> 
3620	Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month	<p>I would like to visit a few places in the states sometime next year, and I was thinking of doing a road trip while I'm at it. I could start in either Los Angeles or Montreal, and then I would like to visit Philadelphia, Phoenix and Las Vegas during my trip; plus whatever there is on the way between - national parks would be on top of the list. I had about $2000 in mind for transport (excluding fuel).</p>  <p>So my question is: how would I get around? I could take the trains or public transport between the States and Montreal because I don't want to have any hassle with importing/exporting a car, and only drive a car in the states. </p>  <p>The 2 options I see here are either buying a used car and then sell it at the end of the trip, or rent a car. </p>  <p>I had a look at hertz.com, and they quoted me ~$3500 (including insurance) for 1 month and this car: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/01dmk.jpg" alt="look mate, the orange car goes much faster!"></p>  <p>But it seems like I have to return the car to the pickup location with Hertz, because if I choose a different drop off location it shows "not available" for this car. Did I just pick the wrong drop off location here of is A->B really not an option? Do I get different rates at different locations? Has anyone advice on how to get this cheaper? I searched for "relocation" on their site, but didn't find anything.</p>  <p>The second option would be to buy a car for $3000, and then sell it at the end of my trip, and hopefully get more than $1000 back for it. Has anyone experience with this? Are there any places better for buying or for selling a car? In which state would I get "more car" for the same amount of money? Would there be any paperwork involved if I buy a car in one state and sell it in another? Anything else I need to know when buying or selling a car?</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p>

I'm traveling home over the new year break and I booked my flights with Alitalia like this:</p>  <pre><code>JFK -&gt; ROME -&gt; TEHRAN TEHRAN -&gt; ROME -&gt; MILAN -&gt; JFK </code></pre>  <p>All the connections are from the same terminals. I know that green card holders are exempt from transit visa in Italy. However, someone pointed out to me that since I have two connections in Italy on the way back, they might be considered domestic flights and I might need to get a transit visa (although I don't change terminals).</p>  <p>So do I really need the transit visa?</p>  <p>EDIT: thank you all for your help. I contacted the airline and they couldn't help. The consulate in my area is closed today and but I'll ask them what kind of visa (transit or Schengen) I need and I'll update once I have more info.</p>  <p>EDIT2: so I ended up changing my flight due to other reasons, but I went to the Italian consulate and they gave me a Schengen visa valid for 3 days that would have covered my connection in Italy.</p>

As an Australian I get to <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/TravelBulletins/Europe_Schengen">stay in the Schengen area for a cumulative 90 days in any 180 day period without a visa</a> and the <a href="http://english.ind.nl/residencewizard/">Netherlands does not allow me to apply for a holiday visa for more than 90 days</a>.

5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p>

12779	Proving onward travel on a South America tour	<p>My question is related to / inspired by <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9426/does-colombia-require-proof-of-onward-travel">Does Colombia require proof of onward travel?</a>  but isn't quite the same.</p>  <p>I'm thinking of a trip around South America (from Europe) such that:</p>  <ul> <li><p>I would <strong>not</strong> arrive and leave the continent at the same country. Instead, I'd arrive somewhere in the south of the continent and leave from the north, or vice versa.</p></li> <li><p>I wouldn't buy flights or overland journeys for within South America in advance (because I'd prefer leaving exact travel dates and routes open). </p></li> </ul>  <p>For example, say <strong>I have (only) two flights booked in advance</strong>: one from Europe to Argentina, and then, 2-3 months later, another from Colombia back to Europe. When arriving in Argentina, or any of the subsequent countries (e.g. Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador), would the return ticket to Europe <em>from Colombia</em> be enough to prove onward travel, or would they require a ticket <em>out of that particular country</em>?  </p>  <p>In other words, <strong>is a return ticket to Europe <em>from another country</em> sufficient proof of onward travel in most South American countries</strong>?</p>  <p>NB: I'm interested in South America generally, not only in Argentina or Colombia. But of course, if there are countries that are more strict about this than others, that would be good to mention in an answer!</p>  <p>How do people normally do this? I mean, it's a very common type of (backpacker) trip to make, right? </p>  <p>I guess the main alternative is to book all border-crossing flights / buses <em>before</em> going to South America, but that limits your flexibility a lot (or is a waste of money if you buy them but don't use them).</p> 
11114	Can I visit Schengen countries on a long term French Visa?	<p>I have requested for a French long term student visa from India. It's a national visa and not a Schengen visa. My question is that can we still go to other Schengen countries on this visa? If not then can we get a Schengen visa from the Indian embassy in France?</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
7708	Travelling to Brazil without return ticket	<p>Last year I was flying to Brazil with <a href="http://condor.com/">Condor</a>. I don't need a visa, if I stay in Brazil below 90 days (regardless if tourism or business). </p>  <p>The check-in clerk asked me about visa or return ticket. I didn't have return ticket, because at that time I didn't plan my whole trip and have not decided where to go next. I was told, that without a visa or a valid ticket out of Brazil I will not be allowed to check in. <br/> (There was enough time, so I just went and bought cheapest ticket to Montevideo, but that's not important here.)</p>  <p>My question is: <strong>did the person have right to deny checking me in?</strong> Is this anywhere in regulations or law?</p> 
2878	Leaving airport international zone for a moment	<p>I'm European Union citizen. I have a flight to other continent, with a change in other European country, Schiphol Amsterdam. Am I allowed to leave the "international zone" and go out of airport and then come in again? I'm travelling only with hand luggage. I once heard a technical term for such and extra fee by airplane company. But really, does anyone care and do they let me in again?</p> 
9027	Layover at Narita, Japan. Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes. I am planning to stay within the airport during this period. Does anyone know if I will require a transit visa at Narita?</p> 
21236	Duration of Schengen visa while travelling to non Schengen areas which allow Schengen visa	<p>I'm planning to travel to the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Turkey. I'll be in Netherlands for 4 days, Bulgaria for 4 and Turkey for 2. I'm applying for a Schengen visa for the Netherlands. Considering that Bulgaria and Turkey are not in the Schengen Area (but accept Schengen Visas for entry), will the duration of the visa be determined by only the Netherlands leg of the trip? Ideally I would want the visa to be valid for at least 10 days to include the entire trip.</p> 
9008	What is the shortest time before departure to board a plane	<p>I have an extreme dislike for standing in queue's and waiting. The worst is standing in the airbridge, while people settle in. So whenever I fly with an assigned seat on the plane, I try to board as late as possible. I rather wander a bit on the airport then queue for some time. I don't mind the lack of storage space for cabin luggage, since I usually travel light. </p>  <p>That is why I try to postpone boarding as long as possible, but still I manage to end up standing in the airbridge most of the time, even when I thought I was pushing the limit.</p>  <p>Is there a rule of the thumb to estimate the latest time to board?</p>  <p>== Edit == No I don't want to be the person everybody is looking at because he delayed departure. </p> 
16627	What is the cheapest way of traveling from Berlin to Krakow?	<p>A friend suggested going by bus to Poznan and from there by train to Krakow.</p>  <p>He said there is no particular reason to go to Poznan, but as whole it's a nice trip. You get to know a bit of Poland and a city that otherwise you would never visit. The price compared to an airplane trip is almost the same. From Poznan to Krakow it's possible to travel at night saving the price of the hotel/hostel.</p>  <p>Time is not an issue.</p>  <p>Is this a good idea? would it be better/cheaper just to fly to Krakow?</p>  <p>Hitchhiking is not an option. Even having time I need to know in advance how much time I will spend travelling.</p> 
2310	Which countries, if any, offer on-arrival work visas?	<p>After seeing <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2287/108">this question</a> I began wondering - are there countries that say, Aussies or Kiwis (or anyone else) can get a work visa on arrival, or while in the country?</p>  <p>The best I've found is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html">http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html</a></p>  <p>which indicates availability of working holiday programs, but for several of them (Argentina for example) you are required to apply to Wellington (in my case) before being accepted.</p>  <p>Chile, on the other hand, you can't get one on arrival, but you can apply for one while being a tourist in the country.</p>  <p>So a chart or definitive source of countries where you can basically wander in and start working (legally) would be the ideal answer for this :D</p>

13989	What first aid material and medicines are absolutely essential when traveling?	<p>When you arrive into a new place / city country / etc. it can be difficult to find some essential goods. Everything is new. First aid material and medicines are sometimes forgotten when planning a trip but it's a specially critical aspect if you are in a situation where you need them. Finding a pharmacy or something similar when ill or hurt is not a "must have" experience abroad.</p>  <p>What first aid material and medicines are absolutely essential when travelling?</p>

17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p>

10322	Indian Trains Wait List - will I get a seat?	<p>After the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9562/where-to-book-indian-train-tickets-online">fiasco</a> of registering an account to book train tickets online using my British VISA card, I finally got into a position of being able to book a ticket, but what it appears to be telling me is that I'm only being added to a wait list, which I assume means my tickets aren't confirmed.</p>  <p>Can someone explain how the wait list works, and what my chances are of getting on the train successfully? </p>  <ul> <li>It currently says the wait list is 7</li> <li>The train is the Mandor Express, from Delhi to Jodhpur on the 18th of Nov</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> So I got the train!

10590	Lost passport with Schengen visa	<p>My passport was stolen in Prague on my way to Vienna. I filed a police report and our embassy swiftly acted by giving me a temporary passport for my onward journey to Munich and Rome. Upon exit from Rome, the immigration ask for the Schengen visa, when I told him that I lost my passport, he did not ask for any document to support my claim, he just stamped my new passport with exit. I am not sure if on record, I am officially out of the Schengen area or not. I am scared that without the lost visa, it appears that I am still in the area and might reach the 90 day limit and will be denied when I re-apply as it would appear I broke the rule. What to do?</p> 
21692	Travelling without a visa after passport was stolen	<p>I am a student on a short term Schengen visa in Belgium. Recently, my passport was stolen after which I got a new passport issued by the Indian embassy. This obviously does not have a Schengen visa (that was on the stolen passport). I have copies of all the stolen documents and the police report. With these, is it okay to travel within the Schengen countries? The visa expiry is still another month away, though I don't know if it is now rendered invalid for travel. Any suggestions?</p>

16	Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?	<p>My wife and I have decided to move across Europe by train. Do you know of any good sites for planning a trip via train (schedule and maybe prices)?

18862	Is there a cheaper (slower) way to get by train from Brussels to Paris than Thalys?	<p>I'm wondering if there is a cheaper way to get from Brussels to Paris by train than Thalys. Thalys prices are alright if you book some time in advance, but it can be quite expensive if you book only a few days before. I don't mind if the travel time takes some extra hours.</p>  <p>This is related to the question “<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13731/what-is-the-cheapest-fastest-way-to-get-from-brussels-to-paris">What is the cheapest / fastest way to get from Brussels to Paris?</a>” but no one mentioned other options by train than Thalys there.

Does anyone know if this is possible?</p>  <p>I been looking at globusjourneys and virgin-vacations for tours. </p>  <p>The tour, that we are looking at, starts at the same city, like Rome. But the concern that I have is that we will be flying to Rome from different countries.</p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
16644	Am I going to have trouble flying with a reversed name on the ticket?	<p>I'm flying to Peru with my girlfriend next week and I realized that her name is incorrect on the reservation.</p>  <p>Instead of <em>Sally Marie Jones</em> it's <em>Jones Marie Sally</em>.</p>  <p>We're flying into Houston, then Lima, and in Lima we switch airlines for our flight to Cajamarca.</p>  <p>I booked the ticket with Orbitz who made the reservation with United. United booked the flight with LAN air, the Peruvian airline.</p>  <p>Both companies say that they are unable to change the name because of TSA restrictions not allowing a name change. I asked if I could just cancel and re-book, but United said they could not do this because there are multiple airlines involved.</p>  <p>A note has been attached to the reservation explaining the issue, and the United rep said that they would be able to print her boarding pass with the correct name. However, he said there are no guarantees that she'll be able to fly because although the boarding pass will be correct, the ticket will still have the reversed name.</p>  <p>I was prepared to just take the chance that it will all work out, seeing how it's really obvious the name is just backwards, but with recent events I'm worried that US airport security is going to be extra strict for the next little while.</p>  <p>Is this something I need to worry about, or are chances good that this will work out fine?</p>  <p>The United rep said there's a chance we could cancel the United flights and get a new ticket with the correct name for no cost, but we'd have to pay for new tickets within Peru ($500 out of the total $1300 ticket cost). I'd rather not do this unless there's a reasonable chance we'll have trouble at the airport.</p> 
7539	Is a 1 hour layover in Amsterdam sufficient?	<p>I found a great price to Geneva (to visit a friend), however the itinerary I found calls for a 1 hour layover (only) in Amsterdam. 5:55am-6:55am. What is the likelihood of missing the connecting flight, since we have to go through customs and whatnot?</p>  <p>I fly abroad pretty frequently, so I know this is an extremely thin margin. I wonder if anyone knows about the speed and efficiency of Amsterdam, or what it will be like that time of day.</p>  <p>EDIT: I want to note the flight is incoming from the USA, not anywhere in the Schengen zone.</p> 
7628	Can you actually do a road-trip in Greenland?	<p>There is of course the epic Top Gear episode where they went for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNkvASxfEWQ" rel="nofollow">North Pole</a>. </p>  <p>I came across this short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr47w7Tz5-U" rel="nofollow">youtube</a> film on some driving the only "freeway" in Greenland. It seems you can drive on Greenland if you are not supported by a television network. Google maps don't show a road map. </p>  <p>So can I do a road-trip in Greenland and where do I need to go? </p> 
89	How to insure checked luggage?	<p>I know that you are not supposed to put valuables into checked baggage, but in some cases it is necessary. For example if you have large valuable items that do not fit in carry-on or if you have enough valuable items that you can not fit them all in carry-on. </p>  <p>My understanding is that while airlines do accept liability for baggage, they typically exclude valuable items such as electronics, jewelry etc. and the liability dollar limit is quite low. I've also heard they will won't accept liability for loss, damage or delay caused by "security searches." Here for example is American Airlines <a href="http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/baggage/liabilityLimitations.jsp">Baggage Liability Limitations</a>.</p>  <p>Given that it seems that airlines have limited their liability to the extent that they probably won't pay for anything valuable -- or perhaps anything at all if they can blame the "security procedures" -- what is the best insurance to protect yourself? I'm from the USA and interested about insurance for international travel.</p> 
10957	How can you protect a fragile object like bottle of champagne in your baggage against breaking?	<p>I tend to bring something quite fragile with me as cabin luggage.

Unfortunately you can't bring a bottle with you as cabin luggage.</p>  <p>I already know that it is okay to bring a bottle of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10928/is-it-okay-to-bring-a-bottle-of-champagne-on-an-airplane-as-checkin-luggage">champagne</a> as check-in luggage (even confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KLM/status/275517290571788288">the airline (Dutch)</a>.)  I am wondering how you can transport a bottle of champagne in your luggage in such a way it doesn't break easily.</p>

19566	How can I work out where I can go for a weekend away by public transport, starting from Oxford or Cambridge	<p>To help out some friends, I'm trying to work out where you can get to for a weekend away, starting in either Oxford or Cambridge, travelling only by public transport.</p>  <p>Are there any tools / websites / maps / books / etc that I could use to work out where I can get to in a sensible amount of time by public transport, from starting in those two cities? I would like to be able to work out the regions that can be reached in a sensible amount of travel for a short break, so I can narrow my search. (For example, I might want to overlay this with a list of gardens, castles, national parks etc, to come up with a short list of places for a weekend away)</p>  <p>Note that I <em>am not</em> after recommendations of places to go to by public transport from these cities, <em>nor am I</em> after a list of such places. What I'm after is advice on how to work that out for myself!</p>  <p>(This question was inspired by <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19491/two-day-overnight-trip-from-london-in-early-january">questions like this</a>, but trying to make something more suitable for our style of Q&amp;A)</p> 
12847	How do I become a better tourist guide for my own city or country?	<p>I'm planning a trip to Melbourne, which is only a short plane trip away from Sydney, and currently I'm planning on using the same information sources to plan my trip that I'd use for anywhere else in the world (Lonely Planet, Trip Advisor, WikiVoyage).</p>  <p>There's the possibility that I'll be sightseeing with someone visiting Australia for the first time.</p>  <p>I'll have a slight advantage in that I've been there before, so I can give my opinion on certain attractions, but apart from that, I won't be able to give the overseas tourist any "local knowledge".</p>  <p>The situation wouldn't be much better if someone were visiting Sydney (where I live), either. I'd be able to tell them about Sydney's transit system, and what time things close, and what suburbs are a bit dodgy. But in terms of places to visit, I'd only be able to list places that are fairly well known.</p>  <p>Is my lack of "local knowledge" unusual?

16649	Are there any man-only places in the world?	<p>I know it is forbidden to enter to Muslim's mosques/shrines without proper Islamic cover or having your shoes during walking through temples/tombs/shrines in India and some other Hindu countries or without proper cover going to a Christian church or monastery but I mean a man-only place which do not let any woman with any kind of cover and religion or proper considerations comes in. </p>  <p>P.S: It is not about divided places which both men and women can go there separately but man-only places.</p> 
22142	How can I find out what places in Central Europre can be reached in a given time from a city by public transport?	<p>When traveling, I'm often interested in visiting the surrounding area. Unfortunately, map distance doesn't necessarily relate well to travel time, especially when considering public transport.</p>  <p>There is a question specifically asking about <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19566/how-can-i-work-out-where-i-can-go-for-a-weekend-away-by-public-transport-starti">travel from Oxford or Cambridge</a>, but that's not were I'm usually staying. Are there any more generic solutions, particularly for central Europe?</p> 
21878	Are 3 hours enough layover time for transferring from EZE to AEP?	<p>I'm looking into flying to Argentina with an international flight from Rome to Buenos Aires (EZE), then have a domestic flight from the AEP airport to Ushuaia.</p>  <p>Is 3 hours enough time for this connection or its too risky (flight delays, time it takes to leave the EZE airport - baggage claim, passport controls.., transfer time to AEP, traffic, ..)?</p> 
18854	Is it okay to board only the second flight of a return ticket? The return ticket is much cheaper than buying one way	<p>I was browsing flight price at Singapore Airlines website, and a one-way flight from SIN to SFO cost this much:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x1kMl.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>That's quite expensive. I tried browsing around and found that a return flight from SFO to SIN and back to SFO cost much cheaper:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FdzuK.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>It's really weird because the second ticket includes the exact same flight that cost 1900+, but it's almost half the price. The reason for this counter-intuitive situation is explained in the answers this question <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11501/one-way-versus-return-airfare-tickets">One-way versus return airfare tickets</a></p>  <p>If I am located in Singapore and my intention is to fly one-way to SFO, is it safe to book the flight in the second picture and only board SFO-SIN leg? Will they deny me because I miss the SIN-SFO flight?</p> 
19478	Travel implications when going to Muslim countries after a visit to Israel	<p>I would like to visit Israel, but I have heard that if you visit some Muslim countries, they won't let you in, and visa versa.</p>  <p>Does it depend on which Muslim countries?  I imagine there would be different policies say between Egypt and Iran.  Does the order of visit matter?  How can 'they' tell you have been to a particular country, is it by the stamps in your passport or what?</p>  <p>I am on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>I have visited Malaysia and Indonesia (Bali) in the past (with a stamp in my current passport)</p>  <p>I would like to visit Israel.</p>  <p>I would like to visit the following Muslim/Middle eastern countries:</p>  <p>Egypt, Jordan (Petra), Turkey, Malaysia again.</p> 
12975	Can I take two laptops to India from United States? One bought in India and one in US	<p>I will be landing at New Delhi airport. The worth of new laptop  (Lenovo Yoga Idea Pad 13) is about $1000 and old one (Macbook Pro) is > 1 lakh INR. I want to leave the new laptop in India.

10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule.

I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
21072	Which backpack theft protection features are there, and which of them work?	<p>While <em>wearing</em> a backpack, what are common/known ways how someone might steal things out of your backpack (or even the whole backpack altogether)? </p>  <p>Which backpack security features can protect against which theft method?</p>  <p>{I’m asking only about features integrated in backpacks, not additional security products (like <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/7180/3089">locks</a> or <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2764/3089">Pacsafe add-ons</a>).}</p> 
328	Will Armenia and Azerbaijan permit a tourist to enter if they have the other country's stamp in their passport?	<p>I know that there are certain pairs of countries (which do not get along with each other) where a traveller will not be permitted into one country if they have a stamp in their passport from a visit to the other country.</p>  <p>Considering the history of Armenia and Azerbaijan I'm wondering if these two are such a pair of countries? I was in Armenia last year and I'm considering visiting Azerbaijan this year while I'm in Georgia.</p> 
22190	Besides Arab/Muslim countries re Israel, are there other countries which don't recognize passports of any other countries?	<p>It is pretty widely known that quite a few Moslem and Arab countries do not recognize Israeli passports because they don't recognize Israel as a country.</p>  <p>I am pretty sure there are other places recognized as countries by most other countries, but not all; and/or places recognized as countries by only a minority of other countries.</p>  <p>Which, if any, countries do not recognize the passports of which other countries? Is Israel really the only case <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/22179/is-it-possible-to-travel-to-israel-if-its-not-recognised-by-your-passports-cou?noredirect=1#comment36887_22179">as asserted in a comment on a recent question</a>?</p>  <hr>  <p>Yes I know the term "country" is particularly tricky in this question where some and maybe most people don't regard a place to be a country, but at least that place and some other countries do.</p>  <p>Answers should focus on places which issue their citizens passports. For some places which assert they are countries their citizens have passports issued by another country, as is the case with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, whose citizens can obtain Russian passports.</p> 
22179	Is it possible to travel to Israel if it's not recognised by your passport's country?	<p>I'm wondering if it's possible for passport holders of countries that do not recognise other countries to travel to that particular country. Israel is not recognised by the Malaysian passport, so would it be possible for a Malaysian (passport holder) to travel to Israel and just not have their passport stamp, or would Israel refuse the bearer entry/visa?</p> 
9654	Are there any "Fantasy Passports" that are recognised by other countries?	<p>I've read about the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/4066/101">Conch Republic</a> passports, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Hutt_River" rel="nofollow">Hutt River</a>, and am wondering - these so-called fantasy passports - are any of them actually recognised anywhere else in the world?</p>  <p>@mindcorrosive also pointed out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Passport" rel="nofollow">World Passport</a> which the EU declared to be a 'fantasy passport'.</p>  <p>According <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage_passport#Legality_of_camouflage_passports" rel="nofollow">to Wikipedia</a>: the legality is one thing - they're legal to posess in NZ and the EU, for example, but the section on effectiveness is empty... :(</p> 
4308	What is the most comfortable way to sleep on a plane?	<p>Some people have the amazing ability to doze off whenever and wherever they are. For the rest of us, sleeping on planes is a constant battle of trying to get comfortable in a cramped space. There are lots of options: special pillows, leaning against the window, folding over flaps on the headrest, leaning on the shoulder of a friend next to you, etc. Certainly something must work...</p>  <p>What have you found to be the best way to comfortably sleep on a plane (in a standard economy seat; first class is a whole different world)?</p> 
10598	18 hr layover in London....should I get a transit visa to explore London....is sightseeing allowed on a transit visa?	<p>Details: I hold a Indian passport with a valid and unexpired US student visa (F1). I would be travelling from Los Angeles to Mumbai via a 18 hr layover at London Heathrow airport in December 2012.</p> 
12967	What is the best way to get ARS using USD?	<p>The current (official) exchange rate for USD to ARS is around 1:5, but I've heard that due to the fluctuation recently there may be a way to get a better value for USD in Argentina.</p>  <p>Any pointers?</p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
22216	How do you call a local service number, when abroad?	<p>I need to call a local service number, but I am out of the country. I am calling a local service a number a short phone number that is easy to memorize or where the receiver is either earning money, or paying the call. In Belgium these numbers are of the format 0800-xxxx, 0900-yyyy 070-zzzzzzz. I am aware that different countries have similar service numbers. </p>  <p>Is it at all possible to call these service numbers if you are out of the country? If I need to be specific about a country, I need a solution for Belgium.</p> 
3624	Are there ways to call "international" toll-free phone numbers?	<p>I just had a lot of grief changing a plane ticket from a somewhat exotic location.</p>  <p>It involved calling with Skype from Tbilisi Georgia to the nearest office for my airline in Istanbul Turkey.</p>  <p>It turned out the office's booking system for the airline was having some trouble but he told me I could call the airline direct on a toll-free number. He assured me it would work even though I didn't expect such things to work internationally.</p>  <p>I tried using Skype and I tried using a Georgian mobile phone. I couldn't get either to work.</p>  <p>So that's the back story. The actual question is <strong>Is there a way to call "international" toll-free phone numbers?</strong></p>  <p>The reason for the scare quotes on "international" is because it's a vague term. It may mean either of these things:</p>  <ul> <li>Something like <strong>800 / 0 800 / 1 800</strong> numbers that can be called from any country.</li> <li>Toll-free number in country A that can be called even if you're in country B. In which case you'd need to use the country code as well as the <strong>800 / 0 800 / 1 800</strong> part somehow.</li> </ul> 
7649	Are there any cheap ways to get from Jamaica to Cuba?	<p>I'm looking for a flight from Montego Bay to Santiago de Cuba (preferred) or La Havana, but I can't find anything below 400 euros (my trip is one way, at the end of July).</p>  <p>Are there any cheap airlines, ferries, or cruise lines that serve this route? Is there a way to transit through another Caribbean island to save money?</p> 
21941	Can I change terminals in Heathrow to access airport lounges?	<p>I have a long layover in Heathrow, like 6 hours, and I have a Priority Pass card to access several lounges on terminals 1 and 3. But I will be arriving to T5, and leaving from there as well. Is there any way to change terminals so I can relax at some lounge?</p> 
17709	Can we switch terminals at Heathrow (LHR) for shopping only?	<p>We will be flying into and out of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. Now, my wife has taken fancy to a certain duty-free store located at Terminal 3. Assuming we factor in enough time before boarding our outbound flight from Terminal 5, <strong><em>are we allowed to enter Heathrow from Terminal 3, shop and then shuttle over to Terminal 5?</em></strong></p> 
20126	How to get same-day emergency money in Thailand?	<p>A Canadian guy at my hostel here in Bangkok lost his wallet last night so is without cash and cards. He flies back to Canada later today but needs some money to survive on and pay the hostel bill.</p>  <p>He called the Visa emergency number and I was surprised to hear that they cannot get him emergency money today. I have used this service in the past in more difficult places than Thailand but I guess things have changed.</p>  <p>There are Western Union offices or agents nearby and he has PayPal. But Googling for the two in combination I learn that Western union does not support PayPal at this time and, worse, there are some scams around involving the pair.</p>  <p>He also asked at the hostel if he could pay his bill using PayPal and transfer some extra money that they might be able to give him in cash - but apparently it's not possible.</p> 
14623	What happens if you cannot pay for a hotel?	<p>What happens if you cannot pay for your hotel stay because you accidentally run out of money (can happen) or your credit card was blocked (much more likely)? I assume you cannot arrange the money on your own in different of ways (like e.g. money transfer).</p>  <p>Are they allowed to hold your passport until you come back and pay? What happens if they call the police? Are you going to be fined? Can the police or other authorities lend you money in this or other more critical situations?</p>  <p>I know this can be a general question about what happens if you run out of money while being abroad, but a hotel is the most common travel-related post-paid service.</p> 
13482	What are the consequences of a US citizen overstaying a Schengen visa?	<p>According to law, what are the consequences of a US citizen overstaying a Schengen visa?</p>  <p>In practice, how likely is one to be penalized for overstaying by a day, 10 days, and a month?</p>  <p>Are there countries that are more likely to enforce the rules on departure?</p> 
8768	Consequences of overstaying Schengen visa in Switzerland	<p>I overstayed my Schengen visa by 2 weeks when I traveled to Switzerland. The police in Switzerland gave me a paper saying that I will receive a penalty order in one or two months requiring me to pay a fine and that I may also be issued a prohibition of entry forbidding me from entering Switzerland and the Schengen states for a period of one or more years.</p>  <p>I am holding a Vietnamese Passport. This occurred today, and I am worrying about what will happen to me.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how much is the fine for overstaying a Schengen visa?  Will I not be allowed to enter the Schengen states?</p> 
22285	Can a hotel kick you out if you let an unregistered guest share a room with you?	<p>We are going to an event and because of this event all hotels are fully booked. Now a friend wants to join us, but can't find accommodation. We are okay with him crashing in our hotel room, either on the couch or on a self-inflatable mattress. We have done this in the past where we secretly sneaked the "guest" in. </p>  <p>It is not that we don't want to pay the tourist tax, it is that when ask and the hotel says no, we can't sneak him in, because we drew attention to ourself. In many hotels you can just order another bed, but there are also a lot that don't have that service. </p>  <p>I don't have any ethical problems with my behavior of secretly hosting a guest. I did pay for the room. I don't like being sneaky about it, since again I do pay for the hotel room. Also if I have to choose between sneaking someone in the room to crash on the couch or let him/her sleep on bench in the park. I opt for the first. </p>  <p>Am I just worrying to much and will being honest about it in the end be acceptable to most if not all hotels?</p> 
11210	Are there good dive spots easily accessible from Kuala Lumpur, without flying?	<p>Somewhat annoyingly, Malaysia Airlines Enrich miles <a href="http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/in/en/enrich/faqs/managing-your-enrich-account.html" rel="nofollow">expire after 3 years from being earnt</a>, and are not extended by subsequent flights with them. Because of this, I have a reasonable amount of miles that I need to use or lose during 2013.</p>  <p>Currently, on the plus side, Malaysia airlines are offering <a href="http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/my/en/products/enrich-live-the-dream.html" rel="nofollow">50% off miles redemption flights booked by the 31st Dec 2012, to fly by 30th June 2013</a>. Under this offer, I have enough for a return flight from Europe to Kuala Lumper, so I'm thinking that's a good way to use the miles before I lose them!</p>  <p>I was wondering about flying out to Kuala Lumper, heading off for a few days diving, then seeing a bit of the city while I wait until I'm safe to fly post-diving. For this plan to work, I'd need to be able to travel between KLA and the diving overland (no flying to avoid the min 24 hour wait post-diving to return), and ideally not taking too long to get there (I'm a bit short on holiday so I can't spend too long there)</p>  <p>Are there any good dive sites in Malaysia that are fairly near to Kuala Lumper? Or is my only option for great diving to have a longer trip, and fly / take a long overland journey?</p> 
1451	What is the best time of year to visit Reykjavík?	<p>When I ask for the "best" time of year, I am looking for a reasonable balance of the following criteria, in order of importance: </p>  <ol> <li>Mild weather. Ideally, warm enough to have coffee outside in a light jacket during the day, cooling down at night.</li> <li>Not too much tourist activity. I'd like to be able to get a table at a restaurant and be surrounded by more locals than visitors.</li> <li>Inexpensive accommodations and flights. I prefer apartment rental to hotel rooms, but will accept data on either. </li> <li>The higher the likelihood of nice aurora sightings, the better!</li> </ol>  <p>Is there a time of the year when all of these factors intersect in Iceland?</p> 
19143	Is a 4x4 essential in Iceland at end of August?	<p>We are making a 4 day trip to Iceland from 24-28 August 2013.</p>  <p>We want to rent a car. We heard that the F-roads (for which you would need a 4x4) are normally closed in August.</p>  <p>Questions:</p>  <ol> <li>Are the f-roads normally closed at end of August?</li> <li>If they are closed, is it still worth getting a 4x4? Do you need it on the normal roads?</li> </ol>  <p>We don't mind driving quite a bit and would like to get to the eastern glacial if possible.</p> 
21428	Restrictions for an EU citizen travelling through EU and working along the way?	<p>I am citizen of a country in the EU, I want to fund my travelling within EU by working in other countries. Would I need a Work Permit to gain employment in another EU country?</p>  <p>I only expect to do temporary work as I go from country to country. Or are there some restrictions?</p> 
11698	Do I need to take any precautions regarding smog when travelling?	<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21002385" rel="nofollow">Beijing had issues with severe smog</a>.</p>  <p>I understand that too much smog can be unhealthy, but also that the likelihood of possible damage is probably related with the exposure time. For sunshine, one uses sunscreen for preventing to get too much sun-burnt. Which, if any, precautions should I take to prevent any smog-related issues?</p>  <p>While Beijing is the city mentioned, naturally this would apply to any city with high levels of smog cover.</p> 
21408	Where can I charge my laptop at SFO internationational terminal?	<p>They have internet at SFO, but I am running out of battery. I have checked all the bars, but none seem to have outlets. Is there any way I can charge my gadgets while waiting for my flight?</p> 
633	Proper policy on using electrical plug outlets in Toronto Pearson International Airport	<p>I tend to be always on long layovers, delayed or even cancelled flights from Toronto. So I like to do work on my laptop and most of the times, I am already out of charge from the previous flight. Are there any policies on what plugs I can and cannot use in Toronto Pearson International Airport? </p>  <p>For example, I know that in some coffee shops, students bring power strips, can I use one in an airport? A next example, plug outlets near the entrances of gates.</p> 
22372	In Asian restaurants and airlines is it correct etiquette to use the hot towel on my face?	<p>In many Asian restaurants both inside and outside Asia, and also on some Asian airlines such as Korean and JAL if I recall correctly, hot cloth towels are given out to all passengers before each meal.</p>  <p>I know they're for cleaning your hands prior to eating but I've never been sure whether it's correct etiquette in the relevant Asian cultures to also use the towel on my face. I'm always too shy to ask.</p>  <p>I've definitely seen other westerners use them on their face and I've done so myself and found it very refreshing, but I've always been a bit worried that I might be doing something other people might find vulgar or even disgusting since I know ideas of hygiene vary widely and in surprising ways around the world.</p>  <hr>  <p>(I'm not asking if I should do it, I'm just asking if it's good or bad etiquette in Asian cultures. Obviously it's my choice whether to regard other passengers'/diners' sensibilities or not.)</p> 
12850	Backpacking to East Malaysia, where to start? where to end?	<p>When travelling to East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), what is the recommended starting town? and which town should be the final landing point?

730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
3559	Can you buy duty free at Kuala Lumpur for travel to Australia?	<p>Currently, Australia has <a href="http://travelsecure.infrastructure.gov.au/international/lags/dutyfree_to.aspx" rel="nofollow">tough restrictions on liquids for both departing <em>and</em> arriving flights</a>. These mean that for a flight to Australia, you will be re-screened before boarding the plane, with liquid restrictions in force again at this point.</p>  <p>One effect of this is that you can't buy duty free in Europe and take it with you to Australia on a "direct" flight, as you won't be allowed to take it with you through security when boarding the 2nd part of the flight. (Your only option would be to only check your bags as far as the change of planes, then collect your bag, clear customs and immigration, put the duty free in your suitcase and re-check. This'll only be possible on a long layover, and is impossible on the usual 1-2 hour stop on most "direct" Europe to Australia flights)</p>  <p>According to the <a href="http://travelsecure.infrastructure.gov.au/international/lags/dutyfree_to.aspx" rel="nofollow">TravelSecure Duty Free info page</a>, if you buy duty free at the last airport you visit before boarding the final leg to Australia, and if that airport delivers your duty free to the gate, then you can bring duty free with you. However, if the airport doesn't deliver to the gate, and instead gives you your purchase, then you're stuffed as you won't be allowed to take it through the screening at the gate.</p>  <p>What I've not been able to find out is if Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL) offers duty free purchases delivered to the gate or not? Does anyone know if the duty free shops there do offer it? </p> 
7523	Full-day stopover at Toronto between two international flights	<p>I have booked round-trip tickets from Paris to Chicago, departing in a few weeks.</p>  <p>The return leg, operated by Air Canada, includes a connection at Toronto (YYZ). The arrival from Chicago is scheduled early in the morning, and the outbound flight is to take off around 8pm.</p>  <p>I would spend better time seeing the city than sitting for hours in the international terminal. As EU resident, can I get a visa to leave the airport for the day? Also, are there any left luggage facilities available?</p> 
7340	Driving license in California	<p>I am relocating to California from New Jersey and will be there for around 7 months. Do I have to surrender my NJ driving license and get a new one in CA?</p> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p>

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
21236	Duration of Schengen visa while travelling to non Schengen areas which allow Schengen visa	<p>I'm planning to travel to the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Turkey. I'll be in Netherlands for 4 days, Bulgaria for 4 and Turkey for 2. I'm applying for a Schengen visa for the Netherlands. Considering that Bulgaria and Turkey are not in the Schengen Area (but accept Schengen Visas for entry), will the duration of the visa be determined by only the Netherlands leg of the trip? Ideally I would want the visa to be valid for at least 10 days to include the entire trip.</p> 
5538	Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?	<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>  <p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p> 
13242	Single/Multiple entry Schengen Visa for visiting Italy and Croatia	<p>I am from India, and I plan to visit Europe for a month. I will be starting with Switzerland, and then I plan to go to Croatia.  If I have a single entry Schengen Visa, go to Croatia, will I be allowed to enter back into a Schengen country (maybe Italy)? Or, do I need a multiple entry Schengen Visa?</p>  <p>Thanks in advance!</p> 
19753	What kind of ID does the US accept when visiting bars or drinking age events?	<p>For tourists visiting the states, what kind of ID do you need to carry with you to visit bars or drinking age events?  I understand the passport is the main piece of ID but do they accept any other forms of ID from other countries such as a driver's license with a photo?</p> 
17855	Schengen visa holder issued by the Italian embassy - getting into Romania via Frankfurt?	<p>I'm planning to go to England, Romania and Italy in June.</p>  <p>I have applied for the English and the Italian visa and both were approved, But when I went to the Romanian embassy in Dubai, I was told that I don't need a visa to enter Romania because I hold a multiple entry Schengen visa and that will allow me to enter Romania for 4 days. </p>  <p>Now I have booked my tickets - Dubai - England, England - Romania via Frankfurt, Romania England via Frankfurt and then England - Italy. </p>  <p>My question is would I be fine traveling to Romania via Frankfurt, considering that I got my Schengen visa from the Italian embassy and that is not my first destination and I do not hold the Romanian visa? </p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
5193	Best way to make my ears pop?	<p>What is the best way to make my ears pop when landing on a plane? The hold-your-nose-and-pitch method is very painful; are there any other methods to pop ears?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
20252	Are there subcategories of seats even within economy class?	<p>Recently I had to travel by Singapore Airlines (Economy class). But when I tried to change the return date of my ticket, customer care office informed me that there are no more seats in my class for the expected date. They ask me to pay some extra few dollars to book the seat on the day I need. Then I  asked him what is the new class my seat is under. He said it is also Economy class. I was surprised, he explained me a long description. But as summary I understood, there are inner categories of seats inside economy class and, air ticket price change according to particular category.</p>  <p>Is this true or are they cheating me to get few more dollars?</p> 
19459	How to visit Capilano Suspension Bridge Park and Stanley Park from Vancouver Airport?	<p>Suppose I have ten hours waiting time in Vancouver airport, I want to visit Capilano Suspension Bridge Park then Stanley Park. What is the efficient way to do it? I don't want to miss my flight.</p>  <p>My flight will land in the airport around 11 am and take off in 10 hours. Here are the issues:</p>  <ol> <li>I have a big luggage, I am not sure should I pick up it? The flight is from China to USA. just stop at Vancouver for connection flight. </li> <li>I have a carry on baggage, I don't want to carry it in my visiting. I only want to bring a camera.</li> <li>I don't want to rent a car or bicycle. I would like take skytrain or free shuttle or walking.</li> <li>Of course I have to consider eating meals time.</li> </ol> 
1668	Getting from downtown Vancouver to the Airport on a Friday night	<p>Later this year I'm going to be at a conference in Vancouver, and potentially I'll need to make a quick getaway to the airport on a Friday night once it finishes.</p>  <p>I've had a look on the <a href="http://tripplanning.translink.ca/" rel="nofollow">TransLink Trip Planner</a>, and it suggests that I take a bus to the nearest SkyTrain stop on the Canada Line, and then take that to the airport. In theory it should be about 40 minutes from the hotel to the airport. This would seem to be the best way to do the trip, quick and much cheaper than a taxi.</p>  <p>What I'm slightly worried about is that on a Friday night, the bus along West Georgia Street (from the hotel to the SkyTrain) may be late/full/etc, or there may be problems with the SkyTrain itself. Should I generally be fine trusting the trip planner timings, I do I need to allow longer for a Friday night? </p> 
8314	Re-checking luggage at connecting airports	<p>I'll be leaving Morocco within the next week, and I'm wondering whether I'll need to re-check my luggage after my connecting flights. I fly from Casablanca to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to London via Lufthansa. From London I fly to Newark, this time with United Airlines. Will my luggage automatically be put onto all of my connecting flights, or will I be responsible for handling this?</p>  <p>I'm somewhat nervous about the Casablanca and Frankfurt airports. In Casablanca, I don't know how easy it will be to check in since I speak no French and only a little Arabic. In Frankfurt, I only have 54 minutes between my flight to London. And that's if the flight is perfectly on schedule. Will things at the Casablanca airport be fine? And is 54 minutes (potentially less) enough time to go through security and board my next flight?</p> 
10947	Saving leftovers from restaurants in Paris	<p>Doggy bags for saving leftovers in restaurants are extremely common in the USA, especially as portions sizes are usually too large to consume in one meal.</p>  <p>But I have read in various forums that it isn't socially acceptable to ask for a box for leftovers in France, and that some restaurants don't even have take-home boxes available. Is this true? If so, are there alternatives to having uneaten food thrown away and wasted? What do the locals do if they can't finish their meal?</p>

2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
21737	Does having a US drivers' license reduce car insurance versus a Dutch drivers' license in the US?	<p>I am currently studying in Buffalo, NY and have no need for a car.<br> However, I may want to go on a road trip and the end of my stay on the west coast. Will it make insurance cheaper to get a driving licence here if I want to rent or buy a car for 4 weeks? I am in possession of a Dutch driving licence.</p>  <p>Also, do they make a distinction between in-state and out-of-state licences when renting a car?</p> 
17748	United Airlines does not comply with baggage policy from IATA Resolution 302?	<p>My itinerary: </p>  <ol> <li>UA: Indianapolis -> Newark (operated by ExpressJet). Flight# UA*<em>*</em></li> <li>ANA: Newark -> Tokyo (operated by UA). Flight# NH*<em>*</em></li> <li>VNA: Tokyo -> Hanoi.

I tried calling UA customer service and was told they have recently changed their policy. The rep however was unable to point me to the document announcing said change.</p>  <p>However the information <a href="http://www.ana.co.jp/wws/us/e/asw_common/guide/baggage_rule_2011/iata_302.html">here</a> says that the Most Significant (marketing) Carrier policy will override other carriers', which means only ANA policy will apply to my itinerary.</p>  <p>Am I missing something? Can I use this information to fight with them at the counter when I'm actually flying? This is a big deal because my family are flying together and it may cost us over $300 on checked baggage.</p>  <p>EDIT: added flight numbers.</p> 
1340	Where is wild camping possible in Europe?	<p>Are there countries in Europe where wild camping with a tent allowed or at least tolerated? How high is the probability that someone will get angry at you or even call the police? </p>  <p>Please consider only cases where the travellers would be using common sense - not making noise, leaving no trace behind, staying out of sight of roads and houses, etc. In our case, the tent is small and easy to hide (dark green) and we won't need a camp fire.</p>

17907	Zen meditation in Kyoto, Japan	<p>A while ago I've read that in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engaku-ji" rel="nofollow">Engaku-ji</a> or in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kench%C5%8D-ji" rel="nofollow">Kencho-ji</a> in Kamakura everyone is welcome to try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen" rel="nofollow">zazen</a> (seated zen meditation) and that the zazen session is really noob-friendly.</p>  <p>Since I'm a noob myself and I always wanted to try this type of meditation I was wondering if there are temples in Kyoto where I can experiment zazen in a friendly-and-noob-proof environment where even the more ungraceful tourist is welcome. </p> 
22323	"Cheek kissing" between men in Mongolia	<p>This afternoon in Ulaanbaatar I was sitting in a coffee shop in a shopping mall trying to make the best of the flaky Wi-Fi there.</p>  <p>A local guy who was obviously slightly drunk arrived and joined my table and decided to befriend me even though we did not have a language in common.</p>  <p>The guy was in his thirties, had a family, and was an artist and rock musician. Once he decided we were now friends he put his hands around me and made an action like kissing my cheek. My policy is when in Rome do as the Romans, and go with the flow. Instead of making contact with my cheek it seemed he took one sniff.</p>  <p>This took place one or two more times before he left. Once while the waitress was there serving as interpreter. She didn't change her expression to suggest it was something unusual, or more unusual than a drunk customer.</p>  <p><strong>Is this a customary thing between men in Mongolia?</strong> I hadn't seen it before and I've spent a day or two hanging out with local truck drivers. <strong>What was this guy doing? Where can I learn about this?</strong></p> 
15997	Start cheek kissing on the left/right side	<p>Cheek kissing is a very discussed topic in each site like this, because it is quite different depending on the country (number of kisses (especially), when to cheek kissing, men/women...) and it is a thing a foreigner will do even in a short stay. There is a lot of information on the internet about each country culture respect of it, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=230482140423484&amp;set=a.145693298902369.29485.145691885569177&amp;type=1&amp;theater">this map</a> of France.</p>  <p>I didn't ever think about which side should be kissed first, until I moved to (southern) Italy and I had a few of embarrassing situations because here they start kissing left cheek, i.e. moving the head to the right. It is even more embarrassing when men also cheek-kiss here.  Then I realized in Spain we always start kissing right check. </p>  <p>But I didn't find information (regarding a few sentences on Wikipedia) about this matter. Is it any cheek-kissing-depending-on-countries collection including it? Maybe it is more stablished in countries with an odd number of kisses?</p> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm.

2589	How to prevent "Delhi Belly"?	<p><em>Montezuma's revenge</em>, <em>Aztec two step</em>, <em>mummy's tummy</em>, or <em>Cairo two-step</em> in Egypt, <em>Kurtz Hurtz</em> in Uzbekistan, <em>Bombay belly</em> or <em>Delhi belly</em> in India.</p>  <p><em>A case of the sh--</em> or <em>Hershey Squirts</em> or <em>The McSh--</em> in North America, <em>Down Under Butt Chunder</em> in Australia, <em>Karachi crouch</em> in Pakistan, <em>Suryavarman's Revenge</em> in Cambodia.</p>  <p><em>Kabulitis</em> in Afghanistan, <em>holiday tummy</em> in United Kingdom, <em>Bali belly</em> in Bali, or <em>Taghazout Tummy</em> in Taghazout or <em>Kathmandu quickstep</em> in Nepal.</p>  <p><em>Beaver fever</em> in Canada, Thailand it's <em>Thai-dal wave</em>.

22663	How to find the genuine websites for consulates, embassies, and immigration offices around the world?	<p>Very often when travelling about the world you need to check the official word on obtaining visas and visa extensions and other related information.</p>  <p>But increasingly it's getting very difficult to find the true official sites with so many "fake" sites offering up information on these services which mostly seem to be there to harvest clicks from search engines. Others are less evil sites run by tour companies but both tend to be inaccurate, out-of-date, and conflict with each other.</p>  <p>The problem is that many of them look official or have official-looking URLs.</p>  <p><strong>What are some ways to decide which of these websites are the genuine ones?</strong></p> 
13877	To how much radiation are you exposed on a transcontinental flight?	<p>You often hear people object to being scanned because of the "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/6021/correct-reasons-for-opting-out-of-millimetre-wave-scanners">radiation</a>" argument. I find this always quite amusing from people just being exposed to higher radiation levels during the average airplane flight. I once read a article on the levels of being exposed to radiation in everyday live, but I lost the article. I remember that the exposure in planes was quit substantial. Somewhere in the order of one body scan is equal to 10 minutes of your average transcontinental flight. </p>  <p>So my question is, to how much more radiation are you really exposed while traveling in an airplane, compared to staying on the ground?</p> 
9027	Layover at Narita, Japan. Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes. I am planning to stay within the airport during this period. Does anyone know if I will require a transit visa at Narita?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
7623	Getting from New York JFK airport to Manhattan, without the sneaky airtrain exit fee?	<p>The last time I flew into JFK, I took the "free" <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk-airtrain.html">AirTrain</a> from the terminal out to the subway. I was rather surprised and annoyed, on getting to the subway transfer, to discover that it wasn't free after all. Between terminals is free, but to transfer to the subway you had to pay a special exit fee of $5. Only after that could you then buy your subway ticket, and head into town. By the time I was at the subway station, it was too late to change plans, so I had to grudgingly pay. They kept this very quiet until you got to the end, and it was too late to change your plans!</p>  <p>For my next trip, I should have more time (I land mid-afternoon, but I'm not meeting friends until after work). I know that with other airports with high charges for the public transport connection, there's often a hidden way to avoid it that locals know. (In Sydney for example, there's a bus that'll take you a couple of miles to a normal railway station, or you can walk just over a mile to another one).</p>  <p>What I'm wondering is if there's something like that for JFK? I'm aiming to get to either lower Manhattan, or Brooklyn Heights. Can I get either to a subway station, or all the way down to somewhere like that, without having to pay the airtrain exit fee? (The subway from out by the airport to Brooklyn/Manhattan is only $2.25, and the current airtrain exit fee is an extra $5, so anything involving private buses/shuttles will likely work out much more!)</p> 
4961	How can I travel with a double bass?	<p>I need to travel among several eastern US cities to auditions and must bring along my instrument: a (huge) double bass.</p>  <p>What is the best way to travel, given that I do not drive, but that most of the cities on my itinerary are connected by rail, bus services, and, of course air. For example, does anyone have experiences taking a double base on the Acela, or in a Manhattan cab?</p> 
13562	How do you choose a restaurant when travelling?	<p>When travelling almost everyone wants to enjoy a local meal. It's part of the travelling experience. If you're not careful, you may end up in an expensive, "extremely" tourist-oriented place, which may not even represent the local gastronomy.</p>  <p>How do you pick a restaurant? Where do you search for information before travelling? Are there any good online guides? </p>  <p>On the spot what are the dos and don'ts? Do you ask locals? Are they a good source?</p>  <p>Note: The problem with locals is that sometimes they try to be extra nice with you and will send you exactly to places you want to avoid. They don't eat in those places, but it's common that they think it's a nice place for you, since it's always full of tourists :)</p>  <p>One of the problems with most review websites is that restaurants go into a positive spiral. They get attention for some reason. From there, they will attract more visitors due to their position, and of course, those visitors will review them again, reinforcing the spiral. That means one may be losing other, maybe even more interesting possibilities, if only looking at "tops".</p> 
20937	How can I reliably make myself a cup of coffee in my hotel room that doesn't suck?	<p>Like most people, I have a habit, and that habit is Coffee. Unfortunately, this can be an expensive habit. There are plenty of methods of making it less expensive, but in my experience, most of them are pretty bulky and not conducive to being carried around the country. Others are more portable, but taste <em>dire</em> (looking at you instant coffee, cheap cup from a gas station, etc...)</p>  <p>Assuming the coffee maker in a given hotel room isn't capable of doing anything besides producing hot water competently, how can I make myself a decent cuppa, easily, cheaply, and effectively? What sort of equipment would I want to look into buying or using to do this? Cost effectiveness and ease of use is as important as portability/quality here. I'm open to cold-brew solutions, though hot coffee is definitely preferred.</p>  <p>As far as resources that can be assumed: Hot water and tap water is 90% of what can be relied upon. A fridge or microwave is occasionally present, but I wouldn't count on either.</p> 
22687	Can you access the Roma Street Parklands from Roma Street Station, without a train ticket?	<p>The <a href="http://www.romastreetparkland.com/pages/default.aspx3" rel="nofollow">Roma Street Parklands in Brisbane</a> are located just on the north edge of the city centre, and feature a nice variety of plants, landscaped gardens, grass etc. They also have some rather unusual locals living there...</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/E6EVE.jpg" alt="One of the locals"></p>  <p>From much of the city centre, the obvious way to get to them would be via Roma Street station. The <a href="http://www.romastreetparkland.com/explore/Pages/gettingthere.aspx" rel="nofollow">parklands website describes</a> how to enter the park from the station tunnel and platform 10. The only trouble is, coming from town, there are barriers at each ends of the station tunnel that you'd need to pass through.</p>  <p>If you're coming in by train, that's no a problem, since you can just exit on the platform 10 side and go into the gardens. However, from town on foot, that isn't the case.</p>  <p>Is it possible for a pedestrian to enter the gardens from the station for free, or would you have to buy a ticket to get through (or more likely just take a long walk to another park entrance!)</p> 
14297	Is it possible to travel on cargo airplanes?	<p>Some time ago I heard someone telling about travelling in cargo planes. Apparently some of those planes have a limited amount of extra seats and companies would sell them for an extra profit.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any information about this? Is that still possible? </p> 
9885	For fear of flying is drinking alcohol a healthier option than pills?	<p>I have a series of flights ahead of me and I have a fear of flying. I usually drink in excess prior to boarding. I have had people recommend pills. I have also heard a mix of opinions on which option is more healthy. Which option is considered to be least harmful to the health?</p> 
22527	Which locations are traditionally Santa's home - i.e. where can you visit Santa Claus year-round?	<p>Obviously around this time of the year, Santa and his minions will be out and about, finding out who is naughty and nice, and delivering presents.</p>  <p>However, the rest of the year he's back at his home.  Where is that generally considered to be visitable?</p>  <p>Yes, in some traditions it's the 'North Pole', but I know at least one other country (Finland) has Rovaniemi as his home.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGGQ7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:20121123_SantaClaus-Chicago.JPG">Image source: Wikipedia</a></p> 
21226	Best options for crossing Lake Victoria by ferry	<p>I'm looking for the best option for crossing lake Victoria between Uganda (Entebbe) and Kenya (Kisumu) in either direction.</p>  <p>Before anyone suggest <a href="http://www.earthwiseferries.com/">earthwise</a> I have attempted calling them (number not found) and have emailed them, and as yet no reply.</p>  <p>My criteria for best is: </p>  <ol> <li>Reliable (runs to a regular schedule, but I'll settle for running) </li> <li>Safe (details of safety equipment and recent mishap record)</li> <li>Cost</li> </ol> 
22735	Is there a ferry running from Mwanza (Tanzania) to Kisumu (Kenya)? Schedules?	<p>I would like to travel by ferry from Mwanza in Tanzania to Kisumu in Kenya. Is there a ferry on that route / something close to it, and if so are there published schedules for them?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
22441	How do I know if my US phone will work overseas?	<p>I have a smartphone bought in the US through a US carrier, not rooted or otherwise modified.  I understand that some phones will work overseas, some won't, and some can if I make modifications to the phone.  How do I figure out if any given phone will work in any given country?</p>  <p>I imagine that the factors include hardware (specific phone, network technology), who my carrier is, and exactly where I'm going.  I'm not asking about <em>costs</em>; I understand that overseas use might be expensive and I would have to check with my carrier and my specific plan.  I'm asking how to know, before going, if I'll be able to make calls and use data at all (other than through local wireless networks).</p>  <p>I'm trying to ask this question generally, rather than about one particular phone that will make the question obsolete in a year.</p> 
16617	How to convince airport security that I am not dangerous when having metallic parts in my body?	<p>I had an operation some time ago and now I have small screws in my shoulder which will not be removed anymore. When I decided to fly for vacation, I supposed that these will may bring me into trouble at the airport when going through the metal detector.</p>  <p>So I asked my doctor and at the hospital if there is any kind of "passport" or something similar which confirms the screws in my shoulder so that I do not get into many problems. Unfortunately, they told me such things do only exist if you get a new knee or something, not if you just have a few screws in your body.</p>  <p>When I flew from Vienna to Amsterdam and back, my fears were confirmed: The security staff inspected me very precise, and I had to explain them my story. Thank god I have some scars left so they believed me!</p>  <p>However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any international "passport" which my doctor and hospital do not know about? If not, what else are my possibilities?</p>  <p>I am not that afraid when travelling within the EU, however I fear that this situation might get quite dangerous when I'm in other countries...</p> 
9305	Are there other country-based theme parks in Japan besides "Huis ten Bosch"?	<p>During my visit to Japan, I was surprised to find <a href="http://english.huistenbosch.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">Huis ten Bosch</a>, while on my way to Nagasaki. It is a park where major and historic buildings from the Netherlands are remodelled on a same-size base. Amsterdam Central Station was there, as well as the Dom Tower from Utrecht and a lot more. Being of Dutch origin, visiting this theme park was hilarious. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/12eMC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I once heard that Japan has more of these theme parks, where historic buildings from a foreign country were rebuilt in actual size. Is this true and if so, which country could I "visit" while traveling through Japan? </p> 
21456	Visiting Stonehenge on the way from London to Bristol	<p>I'm planning a weekend trip with a friend from London to Bristol, and we would like to visit Stonehenge on the way.  I'm aware of tours to Stonehenge that depart and arrive at the same place in London, for instance.  Even the directions from (what I gather to be) the <a href="http://www.stonehenge.co.uk/arrive.php#3">official Stonehenge web site</a>, provide to/from directions from London. For example, the instructions by bus involve taking a bus from/to Heathrow airport.</p>  <p>Is it feasible to visit Stonehenge on the way from London to Bristol (or vice versa) using public transportation (bus and/or train), without a lot of backtracking?</p> 
17625	Alternative to trains in Japan	<p>So we all know about these pretty amazing trains they have in the "Land of the Rising Sun". They are always on time, clean, comfortable. But they are somewhat expensive for the average backpacker.</p>  <p>I'm aware of the Japan Rail Pass and I'm really considering buying it for my upcoming trip there but I'm still evaluating alternatives.</p>  <p>What about buses? Would it be possible to sacrifice some comfort in order to save money and move around Japan (Honshu and Kyushu mostly) with flexibility? Is there something like JRP for buses (it would be cool if you could use it even for buses inside cities)?</p> 
20849	Schengen tourist visa refused. Can I appeal for reconsideration?	<p>My Schengen tourist visa was rejected by the German Consulate, Chennai stating that my date of flying from Chennai to Berlin (02-Nov-13) is not the same as the starting date of leave approval from my office (06-Nov-13).</p>  <p>But my company has sanctioned me leave considering the fact that 02-Nov-13 to 5-Nov-13 are office holidays.<br> I wouldn't blame the consulate because they wouldn't know that and they consider mismatching dates to be a discrepancy.</p>  <p>Now, what could I do?<br> Shall I appeal for a reconsideration without paying the visa fee again? If yes, how do I do that? And also, what is the probability that they would reconsider again?</p>  <p>Or, shall I reapply fresh again with a correction in my leave letter from the office? I have sent a mail to the consulate but they haven't replied.</p> 
22826	Where can I read about the food safety ratings in restaurants in China?	<p>At least here in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia I see posters/signs on the wall of most restaurants that seem to be issued by some government body giving a food safety rating.</p>  <p>Only three ratings are possible:</p>  <ul> <li>A green smiling face.</li> <li>A yellow expressionless face.</li> <li>A red frowning face.</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lhWvM.jpg" alt="Shanghai food safety rating sign"><br> <sup>Shanghai: 食品安全监督公示 "food safety inspection notification" - Thanks to [Harald Groven / Flickr][4] for the photo.</sup></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K6PIf.jpg" alt="Hohhot food safety rating sign"><br> <sup>Hohhot, Inner Mongolia: 餐饮服食品安全等级公示 "Food Safety Grades Notification" - Photo by hippietrail.</sup></p>  <p>But where can I read what they mean? Does the red frowning face mean "gutter oil detected" or "received more than ten complaints over twelve months" or "botulism / E. Coli found in samples" etc?</p> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
8994	Should one bring a power strip when travelling from the U.S. to Europe so that one won't have to get more than one power adapter?	<p>Since then you could presumably plug the power strip into the power adapter and then not have to get multiple power adapters?</p>  <p>Or is this unnecessary?</p> 
14799	Traveling to tomorrow/yesterday	<p>This question always comes to my mind and I cannot find a logical answer to it. We all know that there are some hours differ in the time if we travel from east to west or from west to east.</p>  <p>Suppose I am now at one of the most western countries (like Hawai) where the time is 7 PM on Saturday and I travel to one of the most eastern countries (Like Newsland) where the time would be around 6 PM on Sunday, would it be considered as traveling to tomorrow?</p> 
22897	Where to buy cheap secondhand samue and yukata in Tokyo?	<p>I will be next few days in Tokyo (Shinjuku area) and I want to buy secondhand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samue" rel="nofollow">samue</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukata" rel="nofollow">yukata</a>. Anyone can recommend something?</p> 
12942	Is weed still legal for tourists in Amsterdam?	<p>I have heard it's not legal starting from 2013. I also heard they postponed applying this? So what's the deal? Allowed or not?</p> 
22880	Going to gyms in Japan	<p>I'm planning a trip to Japan and was wanting to do a Gold's Gym there and am curious how it'd compare to a gym in the USA.</p>  <p>So with gyms in the USA I'll often go there with a drawstring backpack with my gym clothes in it. I'll change and then go workout with my drawstring backpack beside me (I don't use the lockers since I've had stuff stolen from them before and don't intend to have it stolen again). Is doing that okay in Japan as well?</p>  <p>Also, I read somewhere that you're supposed to take a different pair of shoes to work out in in Japanese gyms. Is this true? In the USA I normally work out in the same shoes that I went to work in and walked about the city in. ie. I have just one pair of shoes and I wear it everywhere. Do I need to get two pairs of shoes to do gyms (or other stuff) in Japan?</p> 
18415	Car rentals in USA for drivers under age 25	<p>Most companies in the US have a heavy surcharge on drivers under the age of 25. What is worse is that it doesn't matter if you are 21 or 24.9 when you rent. What can be done by under 25 drivers to rent cars cheaply?</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
22916	Can I pick up my luggage between flights with the same company?	<p>I have a flight from Madrid to Aalborg with a stop in Amsterdam. The connection time betweeen the flight from Amsterdam and Aalborg it´s 1 hour and a half. The thing is that I want to stay in Amsterdam for a week and I want to pick up my checked in luggage at the Amsterdam airport. Can I do that if the flight it´s with the same company (KLM for instance) ?</p>  <p>I mean I can tell them that I want to pick up my luggage in Amsterdam right?</p> 
22982	How cheap are the cheapest accommodations in Saudi Arabia?	<p>So I know Saudi Arabia is know for being rich and for not issuing tourist visas.</p>  <p>But if somebody were to go there on some other type of visa, such as a business visa, and then attempt some independent backpacker-style tourism to experience, what would be the lowest price range for hotels or accommodation?</p>  <p>I know there are no hostels and I assume you can camp in a tent in the countryside for free. But I also know not everybody there is rich, and sometimes non-rich people still have to visit other parts of their country where they can't stay with relatives.</p>  <p>Also in rich countries there are often very large expat and guest worker populations. So there are conceivably hotels run by and for Indians and Pakistanis.</p>  <p>Assuming somebody that's not worried about the language barrier or staying in "no star" accommodation, what are the lowest prices for a bed or a room anywhere in Saudi Arabia?</p>  <p>(Aslo assume a non-muslim, not on a Hajj pilgrimage.)</p> 
5779	What is the absolute cheapest accommodation in Kuwait (besides couch surfing)?	<p>I hear that food and some other things are very cheap in Kuwait but that accommodation is "expensive".</p>  <p>Unfortunately the usual sources, such as Wikitravel don't say how much money "expensive" is.</p>  <p>Also I know there are many guest workers in Kuwait from much poorer countries, including the Philippines.</p>  <p>So what prices am I looking at for the cheapest places to crash? Are there hostels? Are there places to camp in a tent? Are there cheap hotels or something else intended for guest workers but where backpackers would also be able to stay?</p>  <p>I'm interested both for the entire country and for the capital, Kuwait City.</p> 
22014	How to find places with Wi-Fi and electricity in China?	<p>I don't travel with a smart phone and I don't want to.</p>  <p>My netbook battery died during my trip and I tried and failed to get a new or reconditioned one in China.</p>  <p>Because I'm hitchhiking I sometimes end up in a cheap hotel with no internet, but I need to research the next day's travels, finding the ways to expressways, tollbooths, service areas, etc, and hostels for upcoming destinations.</p>  <p>Generally I've already researched this info but sometimes I omit an important detail, and other times I lose it all while trying to sneak a peak at the computer without AC power.</p>  <p>In tourist cities there will be hostels with Wi-Fi. But sometimes even then you arrive in the city and need to get to the hostel.</p>  <p>Some chain restaurants like KFC and Dico's have Wi-Fi, but only rarely do they have power sockets.</p>  <p>I had this problem last night in Baotou, the second-largest city in Inner Mongolia where there was no hostel, and again this afternoon in Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia.</p>  <p>Asking people in English doesn't work. They don't understand my attempts at Chinese. Sometimes they can direct me to a place with Wi-Fi, but asking for electricity always stumps them, in English or Chinese. Cafes seem to be hidden in cool areas or student areas, which are not easy to find if you're new.</p>  <p><strong>Are there any foolproof methods that have much higher success rates than my haphazard attempts outlined above?</strong></p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
13608	Visiting CERN in Switzerland	<p>Is it possible to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN" rel="nofollow">European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</a> as a tourist to Geneva? Are there any guided tours? Which parts can be seen?</p>

22149	Are the Bodleian Library's Magna Cartas on show?	<p>The Bodleian Library in Oxford holds four of the remaining copies of the Magna Carta (3x 1217 and a 1225).  Their own website has <a href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/whats-on/online/parliament-week/parliament-week-2011/magna-carta">a page for them</a> which points me to an exhibition they held with the Magna Cartas on the display, but <a href="http://treasures.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">unfortunately that closed back in 2011</a>.  I'd like to see them but I can't tell whether or not I'd need to be an official reader (member) to get access to them.</p>  <p>Are these historical documents on display for the general public to view?</p> 
21557	Cheap cafe or restaurant with Wi-Fi in Jincheng, Yunnan, China?	<p>I'm in a non-tourist city about 40km south of Kunming, Yunnan, China.</p>  <p>For the first time in China I have a hotel with good Wi-Fi but I also like to be able to sit in a pleasant public place surrounded by local sights and sounds while I pursue my online activities.</p>  <p>There are "Internet Bars" which are just huge rooms filled with desktop computers, all inside and with no atmosphere. I'm not looking for these.</p>  <p>In cities further south I found a chain called "Tea Story", some of which had free Wi-Fi and electric outlets.</p>  <p>I'd prefer a place away from the big dusty main roads, but the other main roads are fine. Inside a mall is fine. Hidden in a maze-like shopping area is fine. Perhaps near a school or university? I personally need a place where I can plug in my power supply since my battery no longer holds more than a ten minute charge. But that might not be an issue for other travellers who come here.</p> 
18394	If, like Edward Snowden, your passport was revoked or cancelled, how could you travel?	<p>As per the news, NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden has had his passport revoked by the United States Government.  </p>  <p>From the article:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It was not immediately clear how Snowden was able to travel,</p> </blockquote>  <p>However, he was able to fly from Hong Kong to Russia, and apparently plans to continue on to Latin America / Cuba.  </p>  <p><strong>With a revoked passport, how is one legally able to travel internationally??</strong></p> 
12967	What is the best way to get ARS using USD?	<p>The current (official) exchange rate for USD to ARS is around 1:5, but I've heard that due to the fluctuation recently there may be a way to get a better value for USD in Argentina.</p>  <p>Any pointers?</p> 
20184	Are Australian passports expensive in comparison to other western / developed countries?	<p>I decided not to renew my passport before starting this trip because passports are very expensive in comparison to my income and my low travel budget.</p>  <p>But when asking people I find their passports in other countries are much more affordable than in my country. Typically Australian passports are in the range of roughly double the price friends have to pay in other developed countries or other western countries.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Ordinary adult passport:<br> <code>AUD</code> $238  (<code>USD</code> $212; <code>EUR</code> 161)</p></li> <li><p>Adult frequent traveller with more pages:<br> <code>AUD</code> $358  (<code>USD</code> $320; <code>EUR</code> 243)</p></li> </ul>  <p>Is this a rip-off? Are most passports in "rich" countries so expensive or are they roughly half the price as the impression I have so far?</p>  <hr>  <p>It's true I overlooked passport validity. That's the most important thing I've learned with this question. Assuming all passports have the same number of "visa pages" I should instead ask what the <strong>"price per year or decade of validity"</strong> is.</p> 
6915	Is there a booking site for chartering flights?	<p>Are there booking sites for chartering flights? A Google journey revealed many sites where one could enquire for details on chartering a plane, but so far all the enquiring needs to be done by sending an email.</p>  <p>Are there sites where you can indicate the number of people in your traveling party, plus origin and destination, and then get an instant quote?</p>  <p>In other words, I want to go from Airport A to B, with say a party of 10. I want to find out how much would that cost me if I rent a complete plane with pilots instead of booking 10 tickets.</p> 
18688	Are there any airlines that allow electronic cigarettes?	<p>Unfortunately, I am a smoker. In the 20th century things were easier and many airlines allowed smoking onboard which is <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5224/are-there-any-airlines-that-still-allow-smoking-on-board-flights">almost impossible now</a>. Anyway the electronic cigarettes were introduced few years ago and I have heard that some airlines allow them onboard. What airlines do allow the use of electronic cigarettes onboard?</p>

8314	Re-checking luggage at connecting airports	<p>I'll be leaving Morocco within the next week, and I'm wondering whether I'll need to re-check my luggage after my connecting flights. I fly from Casablanca to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to London via Lufthansa. From London I fly to Newark, this time with United Airlines. Will my luggage automatically be put onto all of my connecting flights, or will I be responsible for handling this?</p>  <p>I'm somewhat nervous about the Casablanca and Frankfurt airports. In Casablanca, I don't know how easy it will be to check in since I speak no French and only a little Arabic. In Frankfurt, I only have 54 minutes between my flight to London. And that's if the flight is perfectly on schedule. Will things at the Casablanca airport be fine? And is 54 minutes (potentially less) enough time to go through security and board my next flight?</p> 
16476	Do I need to pick up my luggage and re-check it between Washington, DC and and Shanghai?	<p>My flight is from Reagan National Airport (DCA) to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK, operated by American Eagle) then to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX, operated by AA) and then to Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG, operated by AA). My luggage will be checked through or I need to pick it up and re-check it at one of these airports?</p> 
17441	Is it possible to buy a ticket where the luggage cannot be checked to the final destination?	<p>My brother recently flew on a flight from the USA to Africa involving three flights on three different airlines. When he checked in, the agent told him that it was impossible to check the bag all the way to the final destination as they did not have an interline agreement with the final airline. As a result, he was forced to pass through immigration/customs on arrival in South Africa to recheck the bag, missed the last flight of the day to Mozambique and spent the night at an airport hotel in Johannesburg (at the airline's expense).</p>  <p>I have a hard time believing that they could sell a ticket for an itinerary that does not allow the bag to be checked to the final destination. Was the gate agent correct or just incompetent? The itinerary was booked as a single ticket through one of the major online travel websites. Also, some of flights were codeshares, but I'm not sure if that makes any difference for luggage.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I know that on international to domestic connections it is usually necessary to clear immigration/customs and recheck the luggage. The same is true for an international to international connection in the USA, but in both of these cases <strong>all passengers</strong> are required recheck bags even though the luggage should be tagged to the final destination. I'm asking about a situation where I know that is <em>possible</em> to change planes without rechecking luggage, but for some reason depending on the ticket or airlines involved they will not check the bag through.</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
12825	Schengen visa for non-EU spouse of EU citizen	<p>Most of the already posted questions were about traveling between EU countries. In my case I would like to visit Austria with my South African wife. We got married over 20 years ago in Austria, lived there together for 6 years, but moved to SA 16 years ago. The permanent residence my wife had once expired and she needs a Schengen visa. The Austrian Embassy tells me that my wife has to apply in person, show proof of income, proof of accommodation, has a travel insurance and all fulfills all other requirements like every ordinary applicant.</p>  <p>Is the Directive 2004/38/EC only applicable for spouses when they are already within the EU or is it also valid in our case? </p>  <p>In particular the personal appearance is a problem as we are living in the Southern Cape and going to the embassy means a round trip of 2600 km, closer is the consulate in Cape Town but still requires a 1200 tour.</p> 
13395	Schengen visa for non-EU spouse	<p>I am an EU citizen (French) living in Asia (Indonesia). I would like to take my non-EU spouse on holiday to Holland and am wondering if DIRECTIVE 2004/38/EC applies in obtaining a free short term Schengen visa without having to show bank statements and hotel bookings. We don't want to move to Europe, just visit. We will also visit the UK and Ireland and both of those countries' embassies tell me that my spouse's visa is free but the Dutch embassy says we need to apply and pay like any other tourist and also show bank statements and hotel bookings etc.  </p> 
19205	Schengen visa for Pakistani national married to British citizen wife	<p>I am a Pakistani citizen holding a Pakistani passport, my wife is dual national meaning Pakistani and British citizen and lives with me in Pakistan; We have been married for 7 years and I have travelled to the EU 4 times previously on business with a Schengen visa. I would like to know: does my wife being a British national make it easier for me to get an express Schengen visa or do I have to follow the long tedious process? Also can my visa be denied if we are applying together to visit France? What benefits can I avail by being a husband of a British citizen when applying for a Schengen visa?</p> 
6132	Visa for France - showing actual hotel booking?	<p>I am in UK planning to apply for Schengen visa via French Embassy. The application document requirements for the visa states that you are required to submit:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Proof of Hotel reservation confirmation required from the actual   hotels throughout the whole itinerary showing the hotel's full contact   details, proof of payment and applicant's name</p> </blockquote>  <p>However I am planning to get the hotel booking done from <a href="http://booking.com">booking.com</a> as it is convenient and has better offers. Will that be acceptable for visa submission? Is it ok to submit the confirmation from booking.com as long as it states my name and complete hotel details (name, location..)?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p> 
9027	Layover at Narita, Japan. Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes. I am planning to stay within the airport during this period. Does anyone know if I will require a transit visa at Narita?</p> 
4941	Is it a good idea to order a ticket for the London Eye in advance?	<p>On the <a href="http://www.londoneye.com/TicketsAndPrices/Tickets/Default.aspx">official site</a> of London Eye, you can buy online tickets that are 10% cheaper than tickets book directly at the location.</p>  <p>If I buy a standard ticket, do I have to specify a date or even a time when I want to visit it? Or can I order a time range? There is also the possibility to buy a fast track ticket. It is almost 9 GPD more expensive than a standard ticket. Are the queues really that long that it would justify such a a huge amount of money?</p> 
2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>". In one <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa/1214#1214">answer</a> it is said that "international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible". The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p> 
956	What is the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA?	<p>Given the extensive time taken for immigration formalities in the US, what is the shortest time to consider between connecting flights in the US, when coming from abroad?</p>  <p>Until now I have always entered the US at my destination. This is not always the cheapest option. I was told that 3 hours is the advised time to go through immigration and boarding of a connecting flight. Online booking sites still offer connecting flights, with a transfer times sometimes even less then 1 hour. </p> 
22927	In which places in China can travellers not stay at just any random local hotel?	<p>I have now heard a couple of times from different sources that in some parts of China you can't just stay wherever you feel like as a tourist.</p>  <p>I hitchhiked from the Lao border to the Mongolian border and never encountered such a problem. If I didn't know of a hostel or guesthouse I would just find a cheap hotel for around 50-70 yuan. It was generally pretty easy.</p>  <p>But I've met other travellers and also either been told or read online that in some areas you can't do this because only certain more expensive places have a licence or permission from the government to allow foreign travellers to stay.</p>  <ul> <li><p>I thought I once heard that this was a problem in the provinces with political unrest, such as Xinjiang province in Western China. </p></li> <li><p>But then I thought I heard about it in areas near the big cities like Beijing or Shanghai.</p></li> </ul>  <p>One of these stories was from a Latvian guy in the same hostel as me in Xi'an about six weeks ago. I thought he was talking about the Beijing area after he finished the Trans Mongolian train trip, but I'm longer sure.</p>  <p><strong>So is this something I should know about before heading west or east? In which parts of China is this the case?</strong></p>  <p>If it's simple, just answer with the list of places. If it's more complicated, answer with a link to a resource with the actual situation.</p>  <p>Just to be clear, I'm not asking about places with general travel restrictions, such as needing a permit to visit Tibet, I'm just asking about where I can stay in any old hotel vs. where I can only stay in "approved" hotels.</p>  <hr>  <ul> <li>Here's an article from six months ago making it sound all good: <a href="http://www.lostlaowai.com/blog/china-stuff/china-travel/foreigners-allowed-hotel-registration-tutorial/">Foreigners Allowed! – Hotel Registration Tutorial</a></li> <li>Here's an article from just over a year ago making it sound all bad: <a href="http://thechinachronicle.com/foreigners-are-still-banned-from-most-hotels-in-china/">Foreigners Are Still Banned From Most Hotels in China</a></li> <li>Here's a thread on TripAdvisor from just over a year ago full of conflicting reports: <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294212-i2147-k5808897-Are_foreigners_allowed_to_stay_in_any_hotel_in_China-Beijing.html">Are foreigners allowed to stay in any hotel in China?</a></li> </ul> 
23246	Accommodation that accepts foreigners in Dandong, China	<p>Here in my hostel in Beijing there's a European couple who want to travel to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Dandong">Dandong</a>, which is a city right on the North Korean border.</p>  <p>So Wikivoyage lists some suggested places to stay but, along with all the places in their Lonely Planet, none of the places will accept bookings from foreign guests.</p>  <p>Obviously this is deemed a sensitive area. But also obviously it was recently possible to stay in places listed in the aforementioned travel guides.</p>  <p>Are there some known hotels or other accommodation in Dandong which have permission for foreign guests to stay, or is the whole city now off-limits to tourists who wish to stay overnight?</p>  <p>If it's really not possible to stay in the city right now, the closest place nearby where it is possible to stay would also be of interest.</p> 
18532	Shower rooms at Incheon airport	<p>I will be in transit at the Incheon airport for a couple hours and wanted to make use of their 'shower rooms'. Has anybody used them? Can you take your luggage in the shower room?</p>  <p>The airport's website links you to <a href="http://www.wellss.com/new/wellss_service_shower.htm">http://www.wellss.com/new/wellss_service_shower.htm</a> and they have some pictures of the showers here - <a href="http://www.wellss.com/new/hub_shower/">http://www.wellss.com/new/hub_shower/</a></p>  <p>At least from the pictures it seems one can easily take their carry on luggage with them inside the shower room. Just wanted to confirm with someone that it was indeed the case. I don't wish to leave my carry-on luggage else where.</p>  <p>Alternatively, are there any good wet wipes for freshening up for long flights?</p> 
711	What are the main differences in traffic regulations between the US/Europe?	<p>There are the obvious ones. The US has the keep-your-lane system, where as in Europe you are expected to keep to the right (left for UK) as long as possible.  On my latest travel to the US, I was confronted with the possibility to go through a red light if you turn right, unless it is explicitly not allowed.  So my question is, what a european driver should know when driving in the US. What are the do's and don'ts compared to driving in Europe. </p>

So my brother agreed to not come and take my sister with me. Can I take my sister on the same ticket which is booked on my brother's name? Or is there a way I can change the name on already booked ticket to reflect my brother's name or is there a way I can cancel the ticket and book the same ticket on my sister's name?</p> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm. I'm an Indian national and have a valid US visa.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay airside?</p>  <p>I have been scared that British Airways have stopped a few people from boarding flights (no details just rumors).</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay landside? I want to do some sightseeing. What are the chances of getting past officials using transit without visa concession?</p>  <p>Real stories will help a lot to calm the butterflies in my stomach.</p> 
2973	Rent a car in Poland without a credit card	<p>This summer I tried to rent a car in Warsaw without a credit card. It wasn't an easy task and it took my hours of talking until I could convince them that it is possible. However, I had to pay the whole bail money in cash.</p>  <p>For the next time, I would like to ensure if there is a company in Poland that does not require a credit card for renting a car.</p>  <p>Last time I used <a href="http://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/home/home.ex" rel="nofollow">Budget</a>.</p>

They say there's no way to do that without a major credit card or debit card + credit history. (Hertz, enterprise, avis, etc.)</p>  <p>I have my insurance, I can make a safe deposit if required, or I have friends who are not traveling with me but have a credit card and are willing to help. but Hertz said you cannot do that.</p>  <p>Is there any way to rent a car in my situation? I'm a little scared about renting a car on craigslist.</p> 
23311	What to do if denied boarding due to the airlines' fault?	<p>Last week, my wife and I were traveling to the United States. During the beginning of the trip, the airline agent suggested that we re-route our trip to avoid some visa-related issues in UK <strong><em>because apparently my wife had an expired US visa and we were going to India to get it renewed - she recently got a job and had applied for a H1-B visa</em></strong>. We did have the proper documentation supporting this but the agent convinced us that we cannot take this itinerary. We agreed with him and paid him an additional $1500 to obtain a new set of tickets. Although I am not quite sure what the agent did, our return trip got canceled. After numerous calls to the airlines' customer care line, I understood that the agent did not make the changes properly because of which the outgoing flight marked us as "No Show" even though we completed the first half of the trip and automatically cancelled our return trip. </p>  <p>The call center agent informed us that it was not our mistake that this reservation got cancelled. After some long conversations with the customer care agent, we were offered an to be placed on an alternate route. However, because the total trip time exceeded 36 hours, we requested that we be placed on a different airline at the least. The agent ignored us and hung up on our request. Because we were not left with any other options, we booked another set of tickets to come back to US.</p>  <p>I have been depressed over losing such large amount of money (nearly $1500 for the one-way trip + an additional $3500 that I paid to buy another set of tickets) and am not sure what to do. I would be very grateful if the experts here can help me with the following: I am currently a graduate student in the US soon entering the job market. What is the safest way to seek retribution against what happened to us without affecting my future employment prospects? Should I even bother doing anything about this or is it lost money?</p>  <p><strong>Trip Details:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Trip: Flying from United States to India and back</li> <li>Airlines: American Airlines (with part of the trip fulfilled by Emirates)</li> <li>Original Itinerary: Chicago ORD to Manchester, UK to Dubai to India</li> <li><p>Altered Itinerary: Chicago ORD to Doha to India with an additional charge of $1500</p></li> <li><p>Expenditure Breakdown:</p>  <ul> <li>Original Expected Expenditure: $2909.06 roundtrip for my wife and myself to fly from USA to India</li> <li>Adjusted Expenditure: $2909.06 + $1496.72 (paid to the American Airlines Agent who issued us Qatar tickets at the Chicago airport) = $4405.78</li> <li>Money lost due to boarding being denied: $2909.06/2 = $1454.53 for one-way tickets of two people</li> <li>Money lost due to re-booking tickets for the next earliest flight on Cathay Pacific: $3542.29 (one-way for two people for the next available flight) + $106.26 (foreign transaction fee) = $3648.55</li> <li>Total money lost due to incompetence of American Airlines: $1454.53 + $3648.55 = $5103.08</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong>  If you have time to kill, here's an open letter (<a href="http://autapsen.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/an-open-letter-to-american-airlines/">blog post</a>) I wrote to AA out of frustration. I don't think I will publicly advertise this anywhere but am putting it here to get an opinion. I thought it might shed more details into the incident. If majority think its my mistake, let me know and I'll back off.</p> 
23324	Was this itinerary switch valid?	<p><strong>Note:</strong> This question is in relation to a slightly complicated scenario outlined <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/23311/what-to-do-if-denied-boarding-due-to-the-airlines-fault">here</a>. You don't need to read that question to get a sense of this question.</p>  <p>My wife and I were traveling to India from United States. Our itinerary was as follows:</p>  <pre><code>American Airlines Flight 54 From Chicago (6:00 PM) to Manchester (7:45 AM) Emirates Airlines Flight 22 From Manchester (8:45 AM) to Dubai (7:45 PM) Emirates Airlines Flight 524 From Dubai (10:00 PM) to India </code></pre>  <p>I was on a F1 student visa. My wife's situation was the following:</p>  <ul> <li>My wife was on F1 visa which was set to expire by August 2013</li> <li>She recently secured a job and subsequently obtained a H1B visa which was valid from October 2013. </li> <li>She was carrying the employment letter, visa appointment confirmation letter (proving that she was going to India to obtain her H1B stamping) and the document that stated that her H1B was approved</li> </ul>  <p>The agent that we talked to at the Chicago airport for boarding tickets denied us boarding. The reason that the agent stated was that we din't have the proper travel documents --  specifically because my wife did not carry a valid US visa. We explained clearly that the H1B was approved and that we were going to India to get a new visa but he did not accept that explanation.</p>  <p>Even though this was supposed to be a transit flight and the gap between transit was exactly 1 hour, he said that he cannot allow us to board this flight. He kept telling us that there is a <strong><em>chance</em></strong> that we can still get through in UK but that he did not want to take the risk at any cost.</p>  <p>As we were in a hurry, after much discussion, he offered to book another itinerary for us through Doha that does not touch UK. </p>  <p>One of the replies to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/23311/what-to-do-if-denied-boarding-due-to-the-airlines-fault">original question</a> suggested that I find out if the agent was right in switching our itinerary. However, I am unable to find any concrete evidence. Can someone help me?</p> 
19031	Will a train ticket to Singapore be accepted as proof of onward travel to fly one-way into Malaysia?	<p>So I've booked my ticket to start my next big overland trip and I've elected to start in Kuala Lumpur because it's the cheapest place to fly to from Sydney.</p>  <p>I've previously expressed some concerns that flying into KL on a one-way ticket could end in being refused permission to board the plane or to enter the country on arrival:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3598/what-happens-if-you-arrive-in-malaysia-with-a-one-way-ticket-but-are-asked-for-p">What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?</a></li> <li><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18615/fly-into-singapore-or-kuala-lumpur-on-one-way-ticket-to-begin-overlanding-trip">Fly into Singapore or Kuala Lumpur on one-way ticket to begin overlanding trip?</a></li> </ol>  <p>Based on advice in those answers my plan is to buy a train ticket from Alor Setar to Hat Yai in Thailand, or perhaps from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore and use that as proof that I'll be leaving Malaysia.</p>  <p>But will this be sufficient? Should I buy a one-way ticket to Singapore and specifically avoid a return ticket? Or would I be better off buying a train ticket north since Singapore is the end of the line to the south whereas the north can take me to many countries far from Malaysia?</p>

18570	Prepaid Data Plan for cell phone in Italy	<p>What is the best option for a prepaid data plan for a cell phone for a short stay in Italy (Sardinia)? I am looking for a Micro-Sim Card. I don't need to call and I need approximatively 300-500 MB.</p>  <p>Ideally, I would like to buy the Sim card in Italy. Where can I buy those cards?</p>  <p>Alternatively, are there other options for such a situation? I heard the EU has passed a law that lowers the roaming fees (I have a German carrier) but it still seems pretty expensive.</p>

19073	Prepaid SIM card for Austria, with mobile internet and relatively cheap foreign calls	<p>I'm planning to spend about a week in Austria.</p>  <p>I'd like to have mobile internet (mostly for geocaching). 100MB should be enough, however, it would be good to have a bit more. I'd like also to have the possibility to call foreign numbers with reasonable price (my travel friends).</p>  <p>Crucial factor: prepaid card should be ready to use just after purchase, so if internet registration is required, it would be rather no-go (the need to search for Internet Cafe etc.).</p>  <p>Does something like that exists? If not, what would be the nearest hit? </p>  <p>For example, in Germany there's Lebara, with mobile plan for 10 Euro, and very cheap foreign calls, but it requires internet registration. T-Mobile is registered by purchase and ready to go just seconds after, but it has extremely expensive foreign calls. If the situation is similar in Austria, in worst case I would have to choose one of available options, or buy both. </p>

11114	Can I visit Schengen countries on a long term French Visa?	<p>I have requested for a French long term student visa from India. It's a national visa and not a Schengen visa. My question is that can we still go to other Schengen countries on this visa? If not then can we get a Schengen visa from the Indian embassy in France?</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
22867	Can I visit all the countries in the Schengen area with a national visa?	<p>I'm an exchange student from Russia, and I have the national visa D type. But it's written there "valid for Italia". Can I go to other Schengen countries with this kind of visa? Because I want to visit France but I don't know if I can. Now I'm in Italy.</p>

My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p>

9651	What documents should you carry with you when travelling internationally?	<p>I actually saw this on a list of top new traveller questions, and figured it'd be a good one to have on here.</p>  <p>Obviously with international travel, you'll need your passport, but are there any other important documents you should consider taking with you when travelling?</p> 
21171	SA nationals in transit from Canada to Jo'burg through LHR - landside visa required?	<p>We have friends travelling from Canada to South Africa later this month - and routing through Heathrow, travelling on SA passports.</p>  <p>We'd love to meet up with them for the ten hours or so they'll be available between flights, but am not clear on their visa status / requirements.</p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p>

23090	UK tourist visa refused 3 times. Need to get there for flight home	<p>Around 3 years ago I applied for a temporary working visa for the UK, but it got rejected because I lied to the police once and had some old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence" rel="nofollow">DUI</a> charges. So I never went to the UK.</p>  <p>I recently arrived in Gatwick on a flight from Amsterdam while on my journey backpacking around Europe. I though surely for those offences a tourist visa would be OK, but no. After keeping me all night, they decided to send me back to Amsterdam. They told me the main reason was that I didn't have any documents with me concerning my transit out of the UK (all of it is on the internet).</p>  <p>When in Amsterdam I collected the massive pile of flight information which I had already booked weeks earlier – my flight home to Australia is from London. </p>  <p>Then I tried to catch the Eurostar from Belgium with the documents they'd asked for. The way I was treated was so disgusting that I still can't believe it. I was asked if I was a "Shanty" (whatever that is). When I told an officer that I'd planned to stay in Brixton to see my friend, he asked me, "Is he black?" When I said, "No – <em>she's</em> not," he said, "There's a lot of black people there." This may give you an idea into the kind of "people" I was dealing with. </p>  <p>After hours of intense questioning where he'd try to catch me out on any tiny little thing I said, and actively try to trick me, and say, "This stamp was wrong," or, "That stamp doesn't exist" and me having to grab the passport and show it to him, they said no, because now they thought I'd work illegally. They knew I wasn't going to, and they knew I knew. It was just about them winning and me doing as I was told. Even if they were wrong.</p>  <p>He told me there was nothing stopping me going to Dublin. So, with only a few days left on my Schengen visa, I did. And they, like every other country I've been to in my 4 years of backpacking, let me in. And today I flew to Glasgow, and soon I will take the train to London.</p>  <p>My problem is, I have a flight booked from London to Iceland, then a return flight to London, where I have 5 days before my flight back to Aus., and they will again probably stop me. My question is this: if I enter the UK from the EU and am rejected again, what will they do with me if my visa is not valid anymore for the country I arrived from? If they'll send me home, that's fine, and to be honest, I'd love to see the UK pay for that after all the money and stress they've caused me. My other question is – if I book a connecting flight to Dublin – will I still have to pass immigration? Or can I stay in the security area?</p> 
10322	Indian Trains Wait List - will I get a seat?	<p>After the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9562/where-to-book-indian-train-tickets-online">fiasco</a> of registering an account to book train tickets online using my British VISA card, I finally got into a position of being able to book a ticket, but what it appears to be telling me is that I'm only being added to a wait list, which I assume means my tickets aren't confirmed.</p>  <p>Can someone explain how the wait list works, and what my chances are of getting on the train successfully? </p>  <ul> <li>It currently says the wait list is 7</li> <li>The train is the Mandor Express, from Delhi to Jodhpur on the 18th of Nov</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> So I got the train! Although it didn't get confirmed until a few hours before it was due to leave. </p>

16846	What is cheapest phone option for a short trip to Europe?	<p>I'm leaving for Europe in a couple days. I'm spending a few days in England and then a few days in Hungary before returning to the US. Unfortunately, I have not given much thought to my phone/internet options until now.</p>  <p>Anticipated needs: </p>  <ul> <li><p>5-10 phone calls total, all in-country, with no more than 60 minutes total talk time;</p></li> <li><p>30-50 text messages total, all in-country;</p></li> <li><p>light Web browsing, with a conservative (high) estimate of 75MB/day for data use.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I have a Verizon iPhone 5 and am willing to take it to use with a different SIM or, if I must, to use as-is with Verizon's "Global Services" rates. For reference, the latter are the same for both England and Hungary: $1.29/minute for voice, $0.50/$0.05 to send/receive texts, and $0.25/MB for data.</p>  <p>What is my best option? Best means both cheap/convenient, but weighted mainly toward cheap.</p>  <p>Happy to elaborate if more info needed.</p> 
19073	Prepaid SIM card for Austria, with mobile internet and relatively cheap foreign calls	<p>I'm planning to spend about a week in Austria.</p>  <p>I'd like to have mobile internet (mostly for geocaching). 100MB should be enough, however, it would be good to have a bit more. I'd like also to have the possibility to call foreign numbers with reasonable price (my travel friends).</p>  <p>Crucial factor: prepaid card should be ready to use just after purchase, so if internet registration is required, it would be rather no-go (the need to search for Internet Cafe etc.).</p>  <p>Does something like that exists? If not, what would be the nearest hit? </p>  <p>For example, in Germany there's Lebara, with mobile plan for 10 Euro, and very cheap foreign calls, but it requires internet registration. T-Mobile is registered by purchase and ready to go just seconds after, but it has extremely expensive foreign calls. If the situation is similar in Austria, in worst case I would have to choose one of available options, or buy both. </p> 
18570	Prepaid Data Plan for cell phone in Italy	<p>What is the best option for a prepaid data plan for a cell phone for a short stay in Italy (Sardinia)? I am looking for a Micro-Sim Card. I don't need to call and I need approximatively 300-500 MB.</p>  <p>Ideally, I would like to buy the Sim card in Italy. Where can I buy those cards?</p>  <p>Alternatively, are there other options for such a situation? I heard the EU has passed a law that lowers the roaming fees (I have a German carrier) but it still seems pretty expensive.</p>

6545	Booking travel tickets for visa without paying?	<p>I am in the process of filling the forms for my wife and daughter (Chinese) to travel with me (British) to the UK for a short holiday. On the government advice located at <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/out-of-country/visitors.pdf">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/out-of-country/visitors.pdf</a> it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Accommodation and travel details</p>      <p>You may wish to submit  the following documents to help show us your   accommodation and travel arrangements in the UK and on which date you   intend to leave the UK. We advise that you do not make any payments   for accommodation,  travel and so on until you have received your   visa. </p>      <ul>   <li>Details of accommodation and return</li>   <li>travel bookings</li>   </ul>      <p>This could be:</p>      <ul>   <li>hotel booking confirmation (usually email) travel booking</li>   <li>confirmation (can be email or copy of tickets) travel agent</li>   <li>confirmation of both accommodation details with a supporting letter    from the occupant confirming  that you are able to stay there</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>But how do you have tickets for a flight if you haven't made payments.

22065	Visa for a Chilean citizen joining a tour from a US agency	<p>I have a friend in Chile (Chilean citizen) with whom we wanted to go on a tour in Italy (January 2014).</p>  <p>I am from the USA, and to make things easier, I was planning to order a tour locally from somewhere like Globus or Virgin-Vacation for both of us, and then to arrive to Rome (me from USA, she from Chile) and meet there to start the tour (get picked up by the tour operators to hotel and so on).</p>  <p>However, she had some concerns recently, because she was speaking about this with their local tour agents. What they have told her, is that she could get deported if she does not present the right documentation for her stay in Italy (which I found very odd, but wanted to make sure once again that she will not have possibility of such problems). Another thing that they have told her is that supposedly it is compulsory for her to have tour insurance to be able to go to Italy? (Is this really true? even for me, tour insurance is optional, if I understand it correctly). My gut feeling tells me like those tour agents are just trying to sell her their own tour packages, however, I want to be sure what is true and what is not.</p>  <p>She will have a return ticket, obviously (with a connecting flight most likely in Spain or Portugal). The tour invoice should also include her name and information of each hotel and rail pass there (any problems of it being ordered from tour company in a different country?). I also know that Chileans have no need to have visas to go to Italy or any Schengen area.</p> 
2720	Is it really forbidden to cross the Indian border with Indian rupee?	<p>Last week I tried to exchange some Swiss Francs into Indian rupees. For that I visited a big bank and they told me that they have rupees but I'm not allowed to import any into India. Is this really true?</p>  <p>And if so, what's the reason behind such a law?</p>  <p>P.S. The bank also told me that in practice it isn't a problem if you take money below 200 Swiss Francs into the country.</p> 
23622	Who pays for the return ticket when a country refuses entry?	<p>If I am on a tourist visa, and refused entry into the intended touring country, then who pays for the return ticket?</p>  <p>I would assume I will have to. But if I have no money of any kind, then what happens?</p> 
23610	UK landside visa queries	<p>I am planning to travel from Chicago to Delhi via London with intention of ~36 hrs in transit.</p>  <p>I am Indian resident, with valid US visa (until 2015).</p>  <p>Going by UK border agency information <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/transitthroughtheuk/visa-to-transit-landside/" rel="nofollow">here</a> I will be needing land side visa.</p>  <p>I have following queries:</p>  <ol> <li>Is it possible to get the land side visa <strong>on arrival</strong> or do I need to apply prior to leaving US?  </li> <li>If it is on arrival, and for some reason I am denied, will I need to wait for connecting flight within airport for that long?  </li> <li>What is the procedure and fees? I scanned through the UK border agency site, but could not find a procedure, and further details. It seems very scattered.  </li> <li>I see that one of the flight option has 48 hrs 15 min difference. Can landside visa be applied for this case?</li> </ol> 
23417	Can I travel within US if name on ticket is abbreviated?	<p>I booked a flight from LA to Miami using my abbreviated name 'Chris' instead of my full name 'Christopher' (per my passport) and the right surname. As the ticket is non-refundable the airline refuses to correct the name. The only other type of 'id' I have with the name 'Chris' is a credit card. Will I be able to use the 'Chris' ticket or shoulkd I buy another?</p> 
21929	I have a Schengen visa but my UAE Residence visa cancelled. Can I still travel then?	<p>I'm a Philippine passport holder.  I have applied recently for a Schengen and UK visa and was approved.

Will all these be possible to do?</p> 
23630	Is a Brazilian tourist visa tied to specific entry and exit ports and dates?	<p>Brazil requires that US Citizens have flight reservations prior to applying for a tourist visa.  Per the suggestions in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/6545/444">this question</a>, I have found what I believe to be the most reasonable round-trip, fully-refundable flight into Brazil, from Miami (MIA) to Manaus (MAO).</p>  <p>If I were to purchase this ticket, get my visa, then cancel the ticket in favor of a discounted ticket from, say, Lima to Sao Paulo, would this create any issues with my visa, as my application would have said I was flying to and from different cities?</p>  <p>Would it also be a problem if I ended up entering Brazil a day or two later (if post-visa application prices have changed to make this financially advantageous).</p>  <p>My international travel is limited, but I would expect the visa simply to be valid from X date to Y date, and the ports of entry and exit would be immaterial. But I don't want to make a >US$1000 gamble on this assumption.</p> 
14417	I had a J1 trainee visa, can I go to Canada and come back with an ESTA?	<p>I'm from Italy and I had a J1 visa for the US for a year and a half. Now it's expired (I'm in the grace period) but I want to stay longer in California to travel a little bit, because this year I did this trainee-ship and I didn't have the possibility to visit all places that I wanted to.</p>  <p>The question is: Can I go to Canada and come back to the US with an ESTA? I'm not subject to the two years rule to go back to Italy? Is it risky after a J1? Do they believe me? How can convince them that I want to travel a little? </p>  <p>Is it easier to do this via Canada than Mexico? My lawyer said yes but I want to be sure.</p>

It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p>

8249	How to order reservations for European trains online (with pass)?	<p>I have a European rail pass, bought in the US, but to go really long distances I still have to order reservations (without ticket). The lines I'm particularly interested in are TGV in France, ICE, and Thalys. Everywhere I read says to do this at the station, but it seems like you wouldn't be able to make reservations for French trains from Germany, and if I wait until I'm in France it will be too late.</p>  <p>Deutsche Bahn's website only sells reservations for trains within Germany. Supposedly you can search and order them at <a href="http://raileurope.com">raileurope.com</a>, but every single one is "unavailable." <a href="http://raileurope.co.uk">raileurope.co.uk</a> seems to work, but the prices for TGV lines are all about £18, much more than the €3-5 that <a href="http://www.ricksteves.com/rail/pdfs/reservations.pdf">this guy</a> says they should be. Most other websites are a pain to navigate and only seem to sell full tickets in the end.</p>  <p>Surely there's another way?</p> 
7935	Which trains in France are included in an InterRail card?	<p>I have two questions related to an InterRail in France, I'm planning to have in August.</p>  <p>I'm planning to get an InterRail pass for France only, or for France and Benelux as well.</p>  <p>Not sure if there are differences between these InterRail cards, inherently to the type of trains I can book/reserve.</p>  <p>What are the trains that I cant take or that require additional reservation costs?</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <ul> <li>are TGV covered except for the reservations or they are not covered at all?</li> <li>how do I know if a train is not covered? for example RATP is a not supported trains company</li> <li>are all trains available on the official french trains website www.voyages-sncf.com covered by the InterRail pass?</li> <li>Ive been told to use the German railways website www.bahn.de because it is more efficient. Any tip is welcome.</li> </ul> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student).

22560	Travelling to the US on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to attend a job interview	<p>I am a UK citizen who has been invited to the US for the purposes of an onsite interview in a few weeks' time. I have been looking online for an answer to this question and have found many conflicting reports (for examples of such differing opinions google terms like 'vwp job interview' and read the many answers).</p>  <p>While applying online using the ESTA form I came across this question (emphasis mine):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>D) <strong>Are you seeking to work in the U.S.</strong>; or have you ever been excluded and deported; or been previously removed from the United States or procured or attempted to procure a visa or entry into the U.S. by fraud or misrepresentation? *</p> </blockquote>  <p>There is no additional context to this question such as 'on this visa' and so looking at it objectively it seems that the only correct answer in my scenario is to answer 'yes' - I <strong>am</strong> seeking to work in the US, albeit in many months time if and when the company a) offers a job and b) acquires an appropriate work visa.</p>  <p>Clearly answering 'yes' to this question is the 'wrong' answer and looks very much as if it would result in a rejection. I do not wish to answer 'no' and be seen as having lied due to the above reasoning (especially if asked at the border what the intention of my trip is - the truth is that I am there to attend a specific interview and leave).</p>  <p>I'm asking here because I cannot find anywhere official that states whether this scenario counts as 'seeking to work in the U.S.' or not. I have only found several people across the web who are utterly convinced of their own reading of the phrase 'seeking to work' and their implicit assumption of non-existent context in the question.</p>  <p>The company in question now tells me I need a B1 visa instead which I have begun the process for, however I am not convinced yet that this is required for my situation, considering my trip will be 2-3 days only. I have tried emailing the embassy in London but it will be a few days before I potentially hear back.</p>  <p>Thank you for any help you may offer.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After reading links in the comments, an additional question is in regards to the difference between the B1/B2 and the VWP - does a B1/B2 visa offer anything regarding job interviews to the holder aside from more time in the US (which in this scenario is not an issue)? <a href="http://travel.state.gov/pdf/BusinessVisa.pdf">This pdf</a> for example does not include mention of a job interview and is linked from <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#overview">this VWP page</a> giving the impression that the two paths of entry are functionally the same in terms of business travel. If anyone knows of an official statement regarding the visa to use for pre-arranged job interviews then this would be extremely useful.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I have received an email response from the London Embassy. They state:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you are travelling to the United States exclusively for an interview or meetings, you may do so on a B-1 business visitor or visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if you are otherwise eligible. Please be aware that you are not permitted to undertake any work on a B-1 visa or the VWP and must obtain the relevant work visa in order to do so.</p>      <p>At the time that you apply for entry to the United States you will be require to demonstrate that your purpose of travel is appropriate for visa-free travel or the visa you hold, and that you intend to comply fully with your conditions of entry and that you have sufficiently strong social and economic ties to your country of residence to compel you to depart the United States at the conclusion of a temporary visit.</p>      <p>Immigration officials at the port of entry make the final determination of each individual’s eligibility to enter the United States.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am still looking for written confirmation about the answer to give to question D) above. It looks as if the answer is simply that the question is worded terribly and that in fact the correct answer is to say 'No' - but this is not directly confirmed yet.</p>  <p><strong>FINAL UPDATE</strong>: I successfully traveled using the ESTA (marking <strong>no</strong> for the aforementioned question) and had no problems at the border when explaining that I was visiting for a job interview. On my landing card I marked that my trip was for business purposes. I didn't even have to show any documentation other than my passport (I had printed my ESTA confirmation, hotel information, interview confirmation etc.) but obviously this may vary. Hopefully this question helps anyone in a similar situation.</p> 
16006	Will I Need a Transit visa or ESTA for the US as a Canadian?	<p>I'm a Canadian traveling from Toronto To Warsaw and I have connecting flights in New Jersey and Frankfurt. Will I need an ESTA or a Transit Visa?</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p> 
22394	Travelling from US to Sri Lanka, do I need transit visa for Canada?	<p>Passport : Sri Lankan Holding a valid US Visa (F1). Spending only 3.15 hours at Toronto Airport. Flying in through United and leaving to my next layover (London) in Air Canada.</p> 
8248	How do I get compensation for messed-up flights?	<p>Short form: the airline I'm traveling on managed to mess up <em>every</em> leg of my round trip (international trip), ultimately costing me most of a day at each end and also some money for expenses along the way.  I'm not interested in vouchers, as I rarely fly and when I do why would I trust this carrier again?</p>  <p>What is the best strategy for obtaining financial compensation?  Or is that just the way the world works now and I'm out of luck? </p>  <p>Longer form (per request in comments): they sold me an itinerary that was tighter than they claimed, the first plane was late, they rebooked the missed flight with a two-leg one, the first of <em>those</em> was late, and I arrived about 16 hours late.  On the return trip the first flight was delayed 8 hours for a proposed ultimate delay of about 15 hours; I think I have that down to 10 after rebooking but I'm not home yet so we'll see.  I will have had about $125 in incidental expenses because of the delay, and the ticket price was about $1700.  Airline is Air Canada.</p>  <p>Blog posts with gory details: <a href="http://cellio.livejournal.com/930425.html">http://cellio.livejournal.com/930425.html</a> and <a href="http://cellio.livejournal.com/931959.html">http://cellio.livejournal.com/931959.html</a> .  The urgency alluded to in the latter is a family medical situation that came up just before I was due to leave anyway.  (It is only because of that that I got the less-late flight.)</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
7144	In the context of air travel, are layovers different to stopovers?	<p>In a recent question somebody <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7140/how-does-customs-work-if-my-layover-is-in-a-third-country">asked about a <em>layover</em></a> without mentioning how long the stop would be, thus implying it might perhaps be understood whether <em>layover</em> generally refers to a stop not requiring an overnight stay.</p>  <p>In Australia where I'm from we don't really use <em>layover</em> but we're familiar with it from American TV and movies, in which travellers never appear to take breaks between flights to stay a few days.</p>  <p>In Australia we do use <em>stopover</em> (it can also be spelled <em>stop over</em> and <em>stop-over</em>) and very often we do take a break on our flights, because they can be very long, to stay one night or many nights in a destination other than our ultimate destination.</p>  <p>So is it that <em>layover</em> means a short break where you just hang around in the aiport and <em>stopover</em> means a long break where you'll spend some nights in a second place en route to your destination?</p>  <p>Or is it that both words mean a stop, either short or long, and the only difference is which is the more popular in each country?</p>  <p><strong>As evidence that they're not the same:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>We currently have two separate tags: <a href="/questions/tagged/stop-overs" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'stop-overs'" rel="tag">stop-overs</a> and <a href="/questions/tagged/layovers" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'layovers'" rel="tag">layovers</a></li> <li>The post <a href="http://maphappy.org/2012/03/the-difference-between-a-layover-and-a-stopover/" rel="nofollow"><strong>"The Difference Between a Layover and a Stopover"</strong></a> on <code>maphappy.org</code> states "Technically, though, a stay in an intermittent city under 24 hours is a layover.

5556	Modifying online flights to include stopovers	<p>I'm trying to get a visa for Canada, but that's beside the point. While I wait, I play with flights online, looking at prices.  I found that occasionally there's this weird multi-stop flight that shows up from Auckland, New Zealand to Nadi, Fiji, to Christmas Island, Kiribati, to Honolulu, USA, to Vancouver, Canada!</p>  <p>Now, these only have stopovers of like 1-3 hours, so it's for a refuel or to drop off passengers.  Certainly not enough time to get off.</p>  <p>However, if it were possible, I'd like to change the flight to include stopovers of a day to a week - I'm not fussed - I'm flexible, but I'd love to spend even a day in some of these places. </p>  <p>Most online booking sites don't seem to include stopover functionality, however.  Kayak allows you to display only flights with a certain length stopover, but this is in the  realm of hours, merely to let you configure it not to strand you in <a href="http://www.sleepinginairports.net/worst-airports.htm#.TznUHJWXdO0">Manila or LAX</a> for too long.  </p>  <p><strong>Is there a way to search online flights to configure stopovers of days in length, or do you have to book separate flights?</strong></p> 
9533	When does the 24 hour layover rule apply?	<p>I understand that most airlines have a 24 hour stopover rule which states that on an international flight if the connecting time at the intermediate point is less than 24 hours, it will count as a layover instead of a stopover (which typically costs extra). For example, the <em>United Contract of Carriage</em> states:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Stopover means a deliberate interruption of travel by the Passenger,   agreed to in advance by the carrier, at a point between  the place of   departure and the place of destination.  For International flights a   Stopover will also be deemed to occur at an  intermediate point from   which the Passenger is not scheduled to depart on the date of arrival,   but if there is no connecting  departure scheduled on the date of   arrival, departure on the next day within 24 hours of  arrival shall   not constitute a  Stopover.  If a portion of the routing is traveled   by surface transportation, one Stopover shall be deemed to have been   taken  for such portion.  For Domestic flights, a Stopover will also   occur when a Passenger arrives at a point and fails to depart  from   such point on:  </p>      <p>1) The first flight on which space is available; or </p>      <p>2) The flight that will provide for the Passenger’s earliest arrival   at intermediate or junction transfer point(s) or destination  point,   via the carrier and class of service as shown on the Passenger’s   Ticket; provided, however, that in no event will a  Stopover occur   when the Passenger departs from the intermediate/junction point on a   flight shown in the carrier’s  official general schedule as departing   within four hours after arrival at such point.</p> </blockquote>  <p>My question is: what is the definition of an <em>International flight</em>? If I fly, from Los Angeles to London stopping in New York City on the way, can I spend up to 24 hours in New York without counting it as a stopover? The first segment is domestic (LAX-JFK), but the second segment (JFK-LHR) is international. How does this work? Does it depend on the airline? </p>  <p>Finally, what is the best way to book a ticket like this? I cannot get long layovers to appear on any site online.</p> 
11047	Can we get a new visa waiver in Canada, for Alaska, when our old one expires in the US?	<p>We are UK citizens driving from Patagonia to Alaska, then shipping home from New York. We hope to be in the US for 3 months, a couple of months in Canada then into Alaska for a couple of  months and then back into Canada and the US. But cannot find information about whether we can get a new visa waiver in Canada for driving to Alaska and then back into the US?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p>

2736	Choices for prepaid GSM data with laptop tethering in Europe?	<p>Planning a trip to Europe later this year that will definitely include Italy, and will most likely include the UK, Germany, and a smattering of connecting and/or distractingly shiny countries. Here in the US, I have both a 4G and 3G mifi and it would be nifty to keep that kind of connectivity while I'm traveling. Both of those gizmos are US-only. My connectivity affects my ability to work while traveling, so it's no exaggeration to say that I'll stay an extra month if I can solve this issue.</p>  <p>I know the trick of landing with an unlocked phone and shoving in a local SIM card, but it's a pain to figure out tethering options for my laptop, which is my #1 priority. (#2 priority: Google Maps.) Are there no-contract providers for this kind of usage?</p>  <p>Question 1a) Alternately, are there EU grace periods for returning a phone and getting a refund? In the US, you get 14 days to return a cell phone.</p>  <p>1b) If the answer to the above is "no", as it would be in the US, are there better options for widespread wifi hookups than Boingo?</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
13504	Carrying my laptop to abroad from India	<p>When I was 14 I was going to USA with my family, my father was carrying his laptop, I was also carrying it but my dad was strictly not allowing that. Which is the solution to carry my laptop from India to abroad? </p> 
6531	How can I visit Chernobyl?	<p>I have heard that it's possible to visit Chernobyl as a tourist (and some questions here on Travel bear this out, asking <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2302/is-travelling-to-chernobyl-safe-for-tourists">if it's safe to do so</a>.)</p>  <p>I'd like to visit it.  What do I need to know to do so well, that is, to get there and to have a good trip?  I'd like to avoid overly-touristy tours, if they exist.  I also really enjoy urban exploration, and I'd love to be able to explore the city, although I think Chernobyl would be somewhere I would have to be careful!  So:</p>  <ul> <li>How can I visit it?  How is best to get there from (say) Kiev?</li> <li>Are there tour companies or guides?  Are these high-quality, interesting, at-your-own-pace or maybe even one-on-one tours, or 'touristy' tours?</li> <li>Can you stay nearby overnight, in order to not be hurried?</li> <li>(Related to the linked question) Are there maps of safe areas and irradiated areas?  How do you know where to go and where not to go?</li> <li>What specific things should I keep an eye out for?  For example, is it true you can see the nuclear plant glow at night?</li> </ul>

23031	How can I minimize the weight of the suitcase of my checked in luggage?	<p>I am going to travel soon and I need to maximize the weight of the content that I am taking in the checked-in luggage and minimize the weight of the bag/suitcase. Are there any tips for this?</p>  <p>I am thinking of taking a cardboard box. It's really light and cheap. It's also disposable at destination if I need to leave it behind. I am not sure one can take a card box and if it's strong enough/consistent to resist an trip (I've seen how luggage is handled). I would appreciate some comments and other ideas/sugestions.</p>  <p>Note: When I write a "suitcase" I mean any kind of bag.</p> 
14672	Inter-country one-way car rental in Europe?	<p>I'd like to rent a car in Germany, drive to Hungary, and return the car there.  Do any car rental agencies allow such a thing (without an enormous fee)?</p>  <p>I'd consider a fee less than 1-2 days additional rental (ie, an extra fee of around €100) to be "not enormous".</p> 
17964	Websites for car relocation in Europe?	<p>Is there a good website for car/camper relocation in Europe ? I mean, those companies that allow you to rent a car/camper for free from point A to point B.</p>  <p>Let's say between Netherlands and Italy/Spain?</p> 
3631	I have a tattoo. Can I visit a public swimming pool in Japan?	<p>A friend of mine is currently traveling in Japan. She has a small tattoo on her neck. Now she wanted to visit a public swimming pool but was denied entry.</p>  <p>It was difficult to understand the reason but it seems that tattoos "look too dangerous".</p>  <p>Can someone explain to me if it is true that you can't visit a public swimming pool in Japan if you have a tattoo? And if so, what's the real reason for it?</p> 
14015	Are airport duty-free shops really cheaper?	<p>I guess this one will be hard to answer because prices vary from airport to airpot, but...every time I travel friends tell me not to forget to "bring something from the free shop".</p>  <p>On a general basis it would be advisable to wait for the free shop to buy things you are willing to buy? </p>  <p>Is the price difference really worth the risk of not finding what you are looking for at the airport? or is it just a marketing stunt to get more sales?</p> 
21090	Biometric passport: How can I know if the chip is still working? Does it matter?	<p>My biometric passport inadvertently spent some time under the rain. It's not badly damaged but some sheets are a bit deformed and there are tiny brown spots on the side. I am wondering if there is an easy way for me to determine if the chip is still working. If it does not, can I still use the passport? Which countries require a biometric passport or actually use the data?</p>  <p>Also, how much of a problem can a lightly damaged/worn out passport be? Is it more likely to be an issue in some countries than others?</p>  <p>PS: Right now, I am preparing for a possible trip to the US and since there is still time, I will most likely ask for a (<s>costly</s>, turned out requesting a new one was free, for some reason) new passport just in case but I would be curious to know if that's really necessary or about potential issues in other countries as well. The passport in question is still valid for more than three years, still has many free pages and was issued by a EU country participating in the visa waiver program.</p> 
5809	The most difficult countries to travel in?	<p>Now at first sight that's a subjective question.  But I'll explain now that it's not.  So please don't answer subjectively either!</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aTransport-dush-khorog.jpg"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DJ73e.jpg" alt="Pamir Highway between Dushanbe and Khorog, Tajikistan"></a></p>  <p><em>Pamir Highway between Dushanbe and Khorog, Tajikistan</em></p>  <p>When papers or publications release pieces about "the richest country" it's usually based on something - maybe GDP, or debt, for example.</p>  <p><a href="http://hitchwiki.org/">Hitch Wiki</a> gives each country a 'hitchability' rating, for example.  But that's only one form of travel, and there's not much granularity in the rating system.</p>  <p><a href="http://meandmychucks.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/which-kind-of-traveler-are-you/"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3UcEE.jpg" alt="generic hitching picture"></a></p>  <p><em>generic hitching picture</em></p>  <p>Is there a publication or source that through some moderately scientific calculation, publishes a list of the hardest (or easiest) countries to travel through?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ssqq.com/archive/vinlin27b.htm"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IK9zE.jpg" alt="Yungas Road or &quot;Death Road&quot; in Bolivia"></a></p>  <p><em>Yungas Road or "Death Road" in Bolivia</em></p>  <p>I'm not sure myself how you would measure this - but similarly, I'm not sure how you'd compare crime stats between countries.

1932	Does being granted a Schengen visa and not going have any consequences?	<p>I'm granted a one-entry Schengen visa and now I can't go. Will having an unused visa in my travel passport have any consequences like future visas refusal? Do I need to do anything special?</p> 
5040	Can I apply for and receive a US visa when residing in country other than my own?	<p>I'm currently residing in a country other than my own, and am planning a business trip to the USA for a week. Being a Bulgarian citizen, I do not qualify for the ESTA visa waiver program, unlike other EU countries.</p>  <p>The US embassy in Sofia lists a <a href="http://bulgaria.usembassy.gov/to_apply.html">7-step procedure</a> which they inexplicably describe as "really quite easy". Unfortunately, some of the steps involved would be a major inconvenience for me, as I'm not residing in the country currently, particularly the interview and the visa/passport delivery.</p>  <p>I was hoping it could be possible to apply for a visa from the country of current residence rather than my own, but I wasn't able to find any information on the US embassy's webpages concerning this.</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
22065	Visa for a Chilean citizen joining a tour from a US agency	<p>I have a friend in Chile (Chilean citizen) with whom we wanted to go on a tour in Italy (January 2014).</p>  <p>I am from the USA, and to make things easier, I was planning to order a tour locally from somewhere like Globus or Virgin-Vacation for both of us, and then to arrive to Rome (me from USA, she from Chile) and meet there to start the tour (get picked up by the tour operators to hotel and so on).</p>  <p>However, she had some concerns recently, because she was speaking about this with their local tour agents. What they have told her, is that she could get deported if she does not present the right documentation for her stay in Italy (which I found very odd, but wanted to make sure once again that she will not have possibility of such problems). Another thing that they have told her is that supposedly it is compulsory for her to have tour insurance to be able to go to Italy? (Is this really true? even for me, tour insurance is optional, if I understand it correctly). My gut feeling tells me like those tour agents are just trying to sell her their own tour packages, however, I want to be sure what is true and what is not.</p>  <p>She will have a return ticket, obviously (with a connecting flight most likely in Spain or Portugal). The tour invoice should also include her name and information of each hotel and rail pass there (any problems of it being ordered from tour company in a different country?). I also know that Chileans have no need to have visas to go to Italy or any Schengen area.</p> 
23187	Discrepancy in address on passport and DS-160 form	<p>I'm likely to get opportunity to go to US for Business purpose through our company.

14280	Ship items back home while traveling?	<p>I am starting a trip around the world today! and my bag looks pretty full already. I am wondering were I will put new clothes/items if I decide to buy some while I am traveling.</p>  <p>Has anyone ever sent things back home (to the USA) in order to make room for new stuff? Which services have you used?  I checked FedEx but they charge about $700 for a 6 Kg pack from Japan. Are there any economical/best options?</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p>

2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p>

22457	Dual Colombian and US Citizenship - can I enter Brazil visa-free as a Colombian?	<p>If I have dual Colombian-US nationality, can I enter Brazil visa-free since they do not require visas for Colombians. Even though they do require visas for US citizens?</p>  <p>In others words, do I <em>have</em> to show both of my passports upon entering Brazil? Can I just show the Colombian passport and enter visa-free? Or will they, upon seeing <strong>both</strong> passports, require me to have a visa? Anyone have experience with dual citizenship like this?</p> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p> 
3085	Dual nationality, EU and Australian. Does it matter which passport is "travelled on"	<p>I plan to visit Australia from the UK, I am an Australian national with dual nationality - I also hold a Greek passport.  I have all the correct documentation and everything is fine.</p>  <p>However, if I leave the UK and present my Australian passport to immigration control on exit from Heathrow, will this then pose problems when I return back to the UK and present my Greek passport. I will be carrying both passports.</p>

21005	What is the difference between customs and immigration?	<p>Maybe this is a question that should be asked at <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com">english.se</a> in stead.

19941	One foot in Belgium and the other in the Netherlands!	<p>I come across this photo in Facebook where the borderline between Belgium and the Netherlands is drawn in the ground splitting a house in two sides one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. One can literally put one foot in Belgium and the other in the Netherlands. </p>  <p>Is this photo real and if so where is it exactly I am so interested in visiting.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uy0CX.jpg" alt="B-NL"></p> 
6751	Getting a SIM card (prepay) in India	<p>Unlike in the UK and most of the European countries (where one can buy a SIM over the counter in any of the shops), getting a SIM in India is a tedious process. One has to provide a copy of ID proof (both photo ID and an address proof) and then wait couple of hours, sometime one day to get the SIM activated. This doesn't seem to be a concern for an Indian resident as we can wait.</p>  <p>I am looking for information from tourists/visitors outside India who were on a short visit (tourist/business) and managed to get a cell connection. I would like to keep this information handy so that I can share it with my friends when they visit India. </p> 
10251	Can you visit the Lille Citadelle?	<p>Looking on a city centre map of Lille, I spotted a very interesting looking 5 point Citadelle at the edge of the old town, as handily shown by OSM:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XvADr.png" alt="http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/14/8330/5510.png"></p>  <p>I wandered over there, and saw some impressive looking walls and ramparts, but after a short walk round part of the surrounding park I couldn't spot anything about being able to go in.</p>  <p>Is the Citadelle generally open to tourists? And if not, are there any times when you can visit the inside of it?</p> 
16455	What should I do to apply for a Schengen visa without income tax return?	<p>I would like to apply for a Schengen visa to travel to Florence, Italy between 30th June to 8th July where I will be attending EuroPython. My request for the grant has been approved by EuroPython committee so accommodation and lunch are totally free for that period. For the visa there is a requirement for 3 years income tax returns, but I start to work last year and I don't even earn enough to file an income return. I would like to know how can I get a visa without an income tax return or what substitute documents I have to submit for the same.</p> 
11510	Buying airfare that permits a 'Free Stopover'	<p>I will use my specific situation, but this should only be considered as an example which should be applied generally. My itinerary would be as such:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>and my goal is to do this as <strong>cheaply as possibly</strong>. After receiving <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11501/one-way-versus-return-airfare-tickets">this epic answer</a> I learned that my best option is to find a flight via the US that allows for some sort of 'extend stopover.' referred to as a <strong>Free Stopover</strong>. Continuing my research I found a flight on the American Airlines website for a <strong>return</strong> ticket that has two stopovers, one in each direction:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Dallas --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; New York --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>for a very good price. To be clear <code>Dallas</code> and <code>New York</code> are stopovers. This would be ideal since Dallas is only a three hour drive from Austin. Now, the question is, <strong>how do I book this itinerary that allows an extended stopover.</strong> In other words, I would like to land in <code>Dallas</code> on Monday and then take the flight to <code>Rio</code> the following Friday i.e. 5 days later. </p>  <p>I realise there are already similar questions out there (such as <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10128/flight-with-stopover-how-to-find-a-similar-flight-but-with-1-week-stopover">this one</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1209/which-airlines-provide-free-stopovers">this one</a>), but they don't cover the specific and <strong>pragmatic</strong> issue of <strong>exactly how to book</strong> such a ticket. Obviously, I can already just buy the ticket online, but how do I <strong>change the date</strong> of the <code>Dallas --&gt; Rio</code> flight? </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>  <p>I should clarify, that the flight I found has two stopovers, but <strong>I only need the one in Dallas</strong>. Also, and I am not sure if I am becoming annoyingly redundant yet, but I am not looking to simply get a stopover, but to have what is termed a <code>Free Stopover</code>, that is being able to arrive in Dallas, but then have a flight for Rio scheduled days later, but still within the dates of my <code>return</code> ticket. </p> 
1209	Which airlines provide free stopovers?	<p>I have heard that British Airways provides free stopover in London i.e. a flight by British Airways via London costs the same as two separate flights from departure city to London and from London to destination city. So does Airfrance with Paris. Also I have recently seen an ad in subway about free stopover in Iceland from Icaelandair. Do you know more elsewhere, especially in Asia?</p> 
19588	How to get to Abisko, Sweden from Berlin	<p>How do I get from Berlin to Abisko, Sweden? I have a Eurail pass, so I would like to make the most out of that. </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I will be traveling in Winter. Still not sure yet, but any time between late October to end early January. I would prefer not to hitchhike, but am looking for an economical way to get there as long as it doesn't take too long. (My definition of too long is anything that would be more than an overnight ride. In fact, an overnight ride may be good in some instances as it doubles as lodging.) </p>  <p><em>Ideally</em>, I would like to get into Abisko in the afternoon, see the lights, and leave before midnight, get to Kiruna and take the train back to Stockholm. I don't even know if train times run that late, but the point is that I want to save money and time!</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Traveling in November/December.</p>

23658	Financial support proof for France Schengen visa	<p>I am planning to apply for France Schengen visa soon. This is 9 days total (including travel). They need my current account statements for the last 3 months.</p>  <p>Reg the proof of financial status, the minimum balance for me works out to be 65*9 = 585 euros say 600 euros.</p>  <p>My question is :  Do I have to have this minimum balance amount (600 euros) on <strong><em>each day</em></strong> in the last 3 months OR is it only that I must have this amount as balance only on the most recent statement? The reason I ask this is that on certain days during the last 3 months - my balance on current account got less than the minimum needed, but the most recent balance is quite more than this.</p> 
16617	How to convince airport security that I am not dangerous when having metallic parts in my body?	<p>I had an operation some time ago and now I have small screws in my shoulder which will not be removed anymore. When I decided to fly for vacation, I supposed that these will may bring me into trouble at the airport when going through the metal detector.</p>  <p>So I asked my doctor and at the hospital if there is any kind of "passport" or something similar which confirms the screws in my shoulder so that I do not get into many problems. Unfortunately, they told me such things do only exist if you get a new knee or something, not if you just have a few screws in your body.</p>  <p>When I flew from Vienna to Amsterdam and back, my fears were confirmed: The security staff inspected me very precise, and I had to explain them my story. Thank god I have some scars left so they believed me!</p>  <p>However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any international "passport" which my doctor and hospital do not know about? If not, what else are my possibilities?</p>  <p>I am not that afraid when travelling within the EU, however I fear that this situation might get quite dangerous when I'm in other countries...</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
6948	Crossing from Georgia into Turkey	<p>Going from Georgia into Turkey overland—can you do that without problems? (Assume no visa requirement for either country.) What border crossing points are there?</p>  <p>Also, what are the public transport options like: Are there any direct connections e.g. from Tbilisi or Batumi crossing over into Turkey? Or if you cross on foot, are there good connections for continuing from the border in the direction of Ankara and Istanbul?</p> 
289	Is the border between Georgia and Russia open to citizens of other countries?	<p>I know the one border between the Republic of Georgia and Russia that is not in a rebel province was officially opened in the last couple of years... but reports are conflicting as to whether people not from ex CIS countries can cross.</p>  <p>So can somebody please confirm one way or another, is the border between Georgia and Russia open for travellers?</p> 
921	Ferry connection between Crimea (Ukraine) and Georgia?	<p>Is there any reliable ferry connection between Crimea on Ukraine and Georgia? Does anyone have any information on that? </p> 
3874	How can I buy train tickets within the UK from abroad?	<p>Is there a machine pick up system like in other countries? Will it take foreign credit cards (Mastercard or Visa of course)? If so, in what locations are these accessible? </p>  <p>Otherwise, how can I get them mailed to me abroad (Sweden) in the most efficient way? I want to book tickets for 5 people in advance, for 6-7 seperate rail journeys. Since it will be quite a lot of tickets to keep track of, I want the simplest method possible of obtaining them to avoid the risk of losing them.</p> 
7807	Single vs. Multiple entry Schengen visa, for Spain and France?	<p>I am from Egypt and I'm planning a vacation to <strong>Spain and France</strong>.

14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days. I have already got visitor's visa for the same on my Indian passport. Particulars mentioned on my visa are:  1. 'Etats Schengen' , 2. Single entry 3. Dates of visit. &amp; 4. Type of visa : C.  I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p>

5605	A day at Dubai International Airport and the city?	<p>On my way to India I'm planning to stay one day in Dubai. I would arrive at 6am in the morning and leave at 3am the next day.</p>  <p>My naive plan is to lock my backpack at the airport and then walk into the city and around to see some of the architecture and then return to the airport in the evening.</p>  <p>So, two questions? Are there lockers or left luggage facilities at the airport? Is it possible to walk to/from the airport and in Dubai itself.</p>  <p>Is it worth spending more than a day, if I just want to look around a bit?</p> 
19052	Can I go to Germany with a Schengen visa from another country after failing to get a German visa?	<p>I have to travel to Germany and Switzerland for business purpose. I have already been here 2 years ago. I have applied for business visa to the German consulate twice and both times the application got rejected. They have put a green stamp on the last page twice. The reason is the purpose and information submitted regarding intended stay is not reliable. I have submitted the documents to Swiss consulate and they have accepted and granted me Visa. Now I have to first travel to Germany and then to Switzerland.</p>  <p>So my question is, with a Schengen business visa granted by Switzerland, may I enter in Germany? Does the rejection stamp has any impact for entering at German airport ? Does it mean I cannot travel to Germany but to other Schengen countries ?</p>

3377	Are there ways to keep long-distance land transport costs down in France when not planning in advance?	<p>Ten years ago I travelled around Europe for the first time and in some countries I was very frustrated by high cost of trains and lack of alternatives to them.</p>  <p>I remember being in Cannes with a friend who had tons of money. I had already spent most of my inheritance despite trying to keep costs as low as possible.</p>  <p>We wanted to do something vaguely like Cannes - Avignon - Lyon - Dijon - Paris (I can't remember exactly any more).</p>  <p>But it seemed that each hop in back-then prices on the TGV was about 50 euro whereas we could go straight to Paris for something like 100 euro.</p>  <p>Furthermore, unlike Germany which I was used to travelling around in by then, there seemed to be no cheaper options for slower trains. I always chose the slowest train because I was never in a hurry and enjoyed the scenery. But in France there was no such option.</p>  <p>In other countries I knew how to travel in, like Australia or Canada or Mexico or would take a long distance bus. But as covered by another question, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3375/why-does-there-seem-to-be-no-long-distance-buses-in-france">there don't seem to be any long distance buses in France</a>.</p>  <p>So this lone option of the TGV made it at least double the price and I had already blown some money on trains from Monaco to Nice to Cannes.</p>  <p>We argued and debated and decided it would be worth the gamble to take a train to Marseilles where we expected we would have a lot more options than in Cannes. But when we got there we found it bigger and busier but with the same expensive TGVs and still no other cheaper slower options.</p>  <p>We gave up and just went straight to Paris very grumpy. To this day I have been put off trying to travel around France for the same reason.</p>  <p>So enough whiny anecdotes and on with the actual question: <strong>Were we doing it wrong? Are there ways to visit all these places without blowing the budget on TGV tickets? Is there any other mode of long-distance overland travel within France?</strong> (No flying please, I want to go on roads or tracks through the countryside.)</p>  <p>Oh and just to make it difficult, I like to travel with no plans. So I can't buy passes or book tickets months ahead and I'm too old for student specials.</p>

20234	Documentation for one parent traveling with infant, Australia to Japan	<p>My wife may soon have to travel from Australia to Japan solo with our child, probably on Qantas or JAL.  She has a Japanese passport in her own last name, our son has an Australian one with mine.  We're resident in Australia and happily married, no custody disputes or other unpleasantness.</p>  <p>I know that some countries/airlines require notarized letters of consent from the other parent for international travel, but I'm having a hard time finding out if Australia takes this approach as well, and if so, whether actual notarization is required.  Any pointers?</p>  <p>I'm fairly sure Japan doesn't care, but on the flip side, Japanese parents are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_child_abduction_in_Japan">rather notorious</a> for abducting children from overseas, since the country was until this year not a Hague signatory.</p>  <p>And yes, I've seen <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13966/when-a-mother-travels-with-baby-2-years-without-father-what-documents-she-nee">this question</a>, but fortunately the US is not involved in her itinerary...</p>

18663	From Hong Kong to Macau: Stay over night or do the boat trip every morning?	<p>I am planning to visit Macau when I am in Hong Kong for 2 days.</p>  <p>I already have accommodation in HK, booked the entire week of cheap hostels, and I was wondering if it's worth to spend a bit more to stay overnight in Macau or do the boat trip "dance" back and forth every day?</p>  <p>The question is not only about the costs alone, but what would I be missing from the city when returning back to HK every night.</p> 
9987	How does one recover from a (personal) disaster while abroad, travel-wise?	<p>I was watching the Bond flick <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/combined">Die Another Day</a> last night. In it, Bond ends up in terrible shape, but manages to escape to the shores of Hong Kong, where he strolls into the lobby of a swanky hotel, is instantly recognized, and equipped, and away you go...</p>  <p>My question is this: supposing I'm NOT going to be recognized, but I've lost my wallet, all ID, everything. How do I get reconnected with my financials? Let me make it clear, I'm not asking how I get a free room and masseuse with no ID, I'm asking how does a real person get a place to stay for the night, some fresh clothes and food.</p>  <p>Let's also assume that I AM actually paying for it, somehow, though I don't have cash or a credit card.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p> 
23776	Chennai to Pune - bus or train?	<p>Summary: </p>  <p>I'm looking for the best photo-taking reasonably priced journey experience when travelling by land from Chennai to Pune in India. </p>  <p>This seems to leave a bus vs train choice.<br> Car travel options that I have seen seem to be very substantially more costly.<br> [Train 'sleeper' about $10!. AC sleeper  compartment about $25 - $50. Buses sleeper or semi-sleeper around $40. Car - $hundreds ]</p>  <p>Detail: </p>  <p>I'm intending to fly to Chennai in India and then travel 'by land' to Pune - about 1100 km away. This is my first visit to India. My intention in travelling by land rather than flying to Pune is to get a first feel for the countryside. When travelling by bus or train I take many photos  and I value being able to do so - dirty windows are a usually unavoidable hazard which I accept (although I have been known to clean the outside of a window by my seat :-) ).</p>  <p>I have been told that travelling by bus is liable to be far more arduous than by train. I have been told that the photo opportunities 'by train' will be about as good as 'by bus'. In other countries this is not always true. (eg in Malaysia the train runs for large distances through palm oil plantations with very few extended views - and these are mainly at road crossings where there is also a settlement.)</p>  <p>Indian travel sites indicate that the fastest land journey from  Chennai to Pune is by express bus (about 20 hours) with the fastest trains taking slightly longer - which contradicts the "buses are a hassle" suggestions. </p>  <p>Web suggestions are that train windows may offer limited views in "AC" compartments. Buses may offer a photo advantage if a window seat can be obtained. However, if the buses run in low visibility highways a train may be better.</p>  <p>Does anyone have personal experiences to offer?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>  <p>" Make my trip" <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com/railways/chennai-pune-train-tickets.html" rel="nofollow">Chennai to Pune trains</a></p>  <p>90 degrees <a href="http://www.90di.com/travel/#search_type=freetext&amp;search_query=/trains/CHENNAI/PUNE/" rel="nofollow">Chennai to Pune trains</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.indiasomeday.com/different-train-classes-in-india.aspx" rel="nofollow">India: classes of train travel</a></p>  <p><a href="http://photo.ecoglobus.com/indiantrainsen.htm" rel="nofollow">Photos of train interiors</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.ixigo.com/by-bus-service/chennai-to-pune-by-bus-cheap" rel="nofollow">5 cheapest buses Chennai to Pune</a> 20 to 23 hours</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ixigo.com/by-bus-service/chennai-to-pune-by-bus" rel="nofollow">5 fastest buses</a> looks much the same</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ixigo.com/from-by-road/chennai-to-pune-by-road" rel="nofollow">Route directions {by car}</a></p> 
2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
18570	Prepaid Data Plan for cell phone in Italy	<p>What is the best option for a prepaid data plan for a cell phone for a short stay in Italy (Sardinia)? I am looking for a Micro-Sim Card. I don't need to call and I need approximatively 300-500 MB.</p>  <p>Ideally, I would like to buy the Sim card in Italy. Where can I buy those cards?</p>  <p>Alternatively, are there other options for such a situation? I heard the EU has passed a law that lowers the roaming fees (I have a German carrier) but it still seems pretty expensive.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
2499	Finding a notary in France / Italy	<p>I sometimes need to have documents notarized while travelling abroad. How can I find a notary in a foreign country? The U.S. embassies and consulates will notarize things for me, but this is inconvenient and expensive.</p>  <p>Specifically, I'm looking for this kind of service in the south of France / northern Italy.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>In my specific case, I need a simple signature verification on a one-page U.S. form. In the U.S., I could walk into any Kinko's and get it done in 5 minutes for $10. </p> 
1444	How to find out your body weight while travelling?	<p>While on the road you don't have your handy scales at home, and without making an appointment to see a doctor, where else could you find some scales to determine your on-the-road weight? This is useful if say, your travel medicine is weight-related...</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p>

3907	Is possible to cross the Bering Strait without flying?	<p>I'm planning a trip and one of my main points is not to fly unless absolutely necessary. My biggest problem is how to cross from Asia to America without a plane. If it's absolutely impossible to cross the Bering Strait without flying, which is the shortest route? Maybe a small airplane?</p> 
543	Is it possible to get from the Philippines to Taiwan to Japan (or the reverse) without flying?	<p>It's not that I have a fear of flying but it seems the best way to see Island countries is by island hopping and these three countries are all relatively close to one another if you take into account their most outlying inhabited islands.</p>  <p>I know there used to be a ferry between Taiwan and Japan that went out of business in 2008. And there seems to be no ferry between the Philippines and Taiwan either.</p>  <p><strong>So how would a true adventurer do it? Can you pay fishing boats or the boats that presumably carry goods between these countries?</strong></p>  <p>I should make it clear that I don't expect to be able to do it on one single boat. One from Philippines to Taiwan and another from Taiwan to Japan would also be good. (More changes would also be good.) I've also included the reverse journey in the question as I'd consider either way to be a great adventure.</p>  <p>Also at which points can I legally enter each country for customs and immigration purposes?</p>  <p>And would it be a lot more difficult to find a boat starting in Japan which I assume to be a much more strictly controlled country?</p>  <p>(Please don't answer "just fly it's easier", such answers will be off topic.)</p> 
22394	Travelling from US to Sri Lanka, do I need transit visa for Canada?	<p>Passport : Sri Lankan Holding a valid US Visa (F1). Spending only 3.15 hours at Toronto Airport. Flying in through United and leaving to my next layover (London) in Air Canada.</p> 
3271	Travel to Okinawa from mainland Japan	<p>We are visiting Japan in April and I am thinking about a couple of days of sun, bathing and snorkelling in Okinawa. What are the travel options for this? Flying from Tokyo is probably one. Are there over night ferries? How long is the trip and what is the expected cost?</p> 
17993	How does "Fuel Dumping" work?	<p>Recently, I saw a lot of blog post, forum posts etc on Fuel Dumping. For me it seemed like you can book a flight with high fuel charges, and then add another unrelated leg to the flight that you not plan to use to get rid of the high fuel charges. However, I could not find any concrete explanation on how fuel dumping works.</p> 
2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen).

16968	Can I use my probationary Australian driver's license to rent a car in the United States?	<p>I got into this driving thing kinda late, which means I have a <a href="http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Licences/GetYourPs/RestrictionsOnPs/P1andP2Probationarylicencerestrictions.htm" rel="nofollow">probationary driver's license</a> from Victoria, Australia that looks kinda like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zuajxGrnHBE/UaQyAyRBeYI/AAAAAAAAOgw/OdfJlTaXHGo/s1600/Vic+Drivers+License1+copy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"> (courtesy <a href="http://angiesommer.blogspot.com/2008/08/drivers-license.html" rel="nofollow">Angie Sommer's blog</a>)</p>  <p>This basically means I've been driving for less than 3 years (these days 4!) and am thus not allowed to drink a single drop of alcohol before driving or rack up more than 5 demerit points/year (vs 10 for full license holders).</p>  <p>In Australia, these make you a leper as far as the major rental companies are concerned, they won't rent to you at any price and the smaller locals that do charge hefty surcharges (often $20+/day).</p>  <p>But now I'm going to the United States.  Can I rent a car there?  (And for what it's worth, I'm well over 25.)</p> 
24239	Do I need a bus/train/plane ticket out of Thailand in order to get a Visa-on-Arrival?	<p>Someone told me I need a ticket out of Thailand in order to enter.</p>  <p>I am traveling to Thailand, on March 18th. I have a Ticket from Bangkok to Sweden booked for June 4th. </p>  <p>I will be staying in Thailand for 2 weeks when I arrive there, then traveling around Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam until June 4th when I leave. </p>  <p>With that ticket out of Thailand, will I be able to get in and get a (30 day) Visa-On-Arrival (or not because the ticket out is not within the first 30 days). Or do I need to show proof that I am leaving within 2 weeks of being there at first? </p> 
5605	A day at Dubai International Airport and the city?	<p>On my way to India I'm planning to stay one day in Dubai. I would arrive at 6am in the morning and leave at 3am the next day.</p>  <p>My naive plan is to lock my backpack at the airport and then walk into the city and around to see some of the architecture and then return to the airport in the evening.</p>  <p>So, two questions? Are there lockers or left luggage facilities at the airport? Is it possible to walk to/from the airport and in Dubai itself.</p>  <p>Is it worth spending more than a day, if I just want to look around a bit?</p> 
21374	Theft insurance in India	<p>Are there any theft insurance options available while travelling in India. I am an Indian as well and I am planning to travel throughout India for a couple of months. I will be carrying my camera, laptop and mobile phone which I do not want to lose. Even if they are stolen, I want to make sure that my losses are minimum.</p> 
24431	What is a good data plan for Internet surfing in northern Italy?	<p>I've checked the webpages of some their providers, but franly, just like in the case of those in my own language, I literally cannot find my way around them. So if you wouldn't mind sharing a word of two or advice.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a good solution for mobile internet surfing in northern Italy, that can be connected to a laptop (you know, that usb stick with a SIM card inside kind of thing). 15 Gb or so at some decent speed. Can you perhaps give a recommendation or two of what to get?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to define what I'm looking for exactly. A data plan of 15 Gb with an internet key (usb stick into which a SMS card goes) that you plug into a laptop. Preferably non-contractual, so I can cancel when I leave.<br> I am not interested in surfing on my mobile phone since due to size I still prefer the smaller Nokia-like models for calls (smaller to carry) - no internet on them.</p> 
24153	How much hard cash can I carry while travelling overseas (India to Poland)	<p>I am going to travel from India to Poland.  </p>  <p>I have a travel card, but what's the limit of hard cash that I can carry?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p> 
12860	Half day in Berlin - after non-classical tourist spots	<p>I will have half a day to spend in Berlin, on a Saturday afternoon. What do you recommend I should go and see/taste? I am not aiming for classical "tourist" spots, as we have a guided city tour before, hopefully it will show all the interesting spots, but much more the the things that are not so obviously on the must see and do, but they are still interesting.</p>  <p>I am interested in going to <strong>an antique shop or two, to a food shop (where i can buy Lebkuchen and good German sausages) and I really enjoy the hidden architecture gems of old houses. Nothing new, nothing fancy, nothing modern.</strong> I'd like to skip the museums and galleries, I have the tendency to spend in there too much time, which I don't have with this occasion.</p>  <p><strong>Also, can someone recommend a Toy store in the area around the Tiergarten?</strong></p> 
5637	Activities in Montreal for a Bachelor party	<p>I'm currently planning a bachelor party for a friend, and plan on holding it in Montreal next month. There a some people in our group who have a passing familiarity with the area, but mostly only know the nightclub scene. (Which, if they're correct, is in St. Laurent. I couldn't find anything online to verify.)</p>  <p>So far, my research shows that most of the happening is in downtown Montreal, Mont Royal, and Plateau Mont Royal areas. However, searching for stuff to do repeatedly turns up historical/slow-paced activities in Montreal (e.g., Vieux/Old Montreal, Place de Beaux Arts).</p>  <p>Given this, can anyone provide recommendations for activities? I'm mostly interested in daytime activities, but I'm open to nighttime ones as well. (And if it makes any difference, we're from the US, and know no French.)</p> 
7695	Layover at Tokyo Narita airport: can I travel outside, and what kind of visa would I need?	<p>I am traveling from Singapore to San Francisco and an airline which I am choosing has a layover of 7.5 hours at Tokyo Airport (NRT). I am wondering if I would be allowed to go out to experience the city for a while in some form a visitor visa.  I know, Singapore has such facilities, but does anyone know if I can do something similar in Tokyo? Any suggestions or pointers are welcome. Note - I do not have a visa for Japan yet, but I am hoping that 1 day visitor visa could be possible at airport.</p> 
24547	Ferry from Motobu, Okinawa to Kagoshima, Kyushu?	<p>I know there is a ferry from <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Naha">Naha, Okinawa</a> to <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Kagoshima">Kagoshima, Kyushu</a>.</p>  <p>I know it takes on the order of a whole day or longer and that its price is approximately equivalent to $150. I am also aware that there might be flights to the main islands of Japan for less.</p>  <p>In my searching I found a mention that the ferry stops at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motobu,_Okinawa">Motobu in the north of Okinawa</a> on the way. Naha is in the south. But I can't seem to find any information on whether it's possible to for a passenger to board the ferry in Motobu and, if so, whether the price might be a little cheaper.</p>  <p>(I am also interested in other ways of getting from Okinawa to the main islands of Japan by sea too but have not come across anything else.)</p> 
7091	How to use Turkish toilet tap?	<p>I was in Turkey a while ago, and encountered sit toilets with taps (edit: taps controlling a nozzle a wee way below a normal western sit-toilet rim, making a little fountain from the back to the front inside the bowl). While I was brave enough to turn the tap on briefly, I was perplexed that the stream wasn't particularly forceful, so it's obviously intended that one uses one's hand, but since toilet paper was provided, I didn't need to experiment.</p>  <p>My question amounts to: how does it work? Is it basically the same leaning to one side to wipe? If so, do you follow up with soap both on hands and derrière, or... how do you know which towel to sully? (Edit: aside from it being a chilly experience, I don't want to end up with an uncomfortably and embarrassingly wet bottom or find myself having used over half a roll to get dry, or use the wrong towel, assuming there's one even there!)</p> 
19790	Are the hoses in toilets in Asia something I should know about?	<p>I have noticed random bits of hose without proper fittings before I think for example in India and just assumed they are for use by the cleaners or for filling the water jug in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3080/ok-were-all-adults-here-so-really-how-on-earth-should-i-use-a-squat-toilet">squat toilets</a>.</p>  <p>But Now I'm travelling in Malaysia and Singapore and there are more western toilets than squat toilets in the places I've been yet proper hoses with proper fittings are very common in toilets:<br> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pUCe2.jpg" alt="A hose in a toilet in Malaysia"><br> <sup>(Hose next to a Western style toilet in my hostel in Chinatown, Kuala Lumpur.)</sup></p>  <p>At one place in Singapore there were even signs on each cubicle door stating whether it contained a western or squat toilet, but also whether there was a hose! (I didn't take a photo of the sign, unfortunately)</p>  <p>This makes me think there is a use for the hose for clients, not just cleaners. But for what purpose? Should I know how to use it as a tourist? Please tell me it's not a kind of alternative to a bidet!</p>  <p>Possibly related is the fact that many toilet floors are awash with water. This can be a big problem if you're not wearing waterproof shoes or have to lower your trousers and keep them dry. Other than this toilets are pretty clean and I've seen both the hoses and the wetness in what I would regard as somewhat "fancy" places.</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
6971	Avoiding the traveller's 'fanny pack' / money-belt	<p>A friend insists on wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_belt">moneybelt</a> while travelling.  Some prefer (shudder) '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_pack">fanny-packs</a>' .</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sBQ5M.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H5pc0.jpg" alt="Moneybelt"></p>  <p>I can't be bothered, frankly, I used to when I was 20 (have a money belt), but these days it's a wallet for me.  To be fair, I was once pick-pocketed but that was at La Tomatina, I had 10 people pressed up against me and couldn't do much about it - although I admit a moneybelt would have prevented it then.</p>  <p>However, there must be a better solution than a moneybelt? I've seen people with chains attached to their wallets, or carefully putting their wallets in a backpack, but that of course comes with its own risks.</p>  <p><strong>Is there a commercially available, <em>socially acceptable</em>, safe way of securing the money you carry with you?</strong></p> 
22647	Baggage didn't clear customs - how do I get it?	<p>I was traveling from India to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada via Montreal by connecting flight.</p>  <p>My airline's (Qatar) agent told me in India that you will get your baggage at the final destination (Saskatoon) so I didn't pick up my baggage at Montreal airport.</p>  <p>However, I didn't get my baggage at Saskatoon Airport, so had to file all the relevant baggage claim and custom forms.</p>  <p>After two days gone I am still waiting for my baggage because I have very important documents in one of my bags. So, please help me what to do next and what are the procedure for claiming the baggage?</p> 
16255	I'm an Indonesian citizen. Do I need a visa for South Korea?	<p>I'm an Indonesian citizen holding an US visa. My itinerary is USA -> China -> South Korea -> China -> USA. All within 2 weeks. Do I need to apply for a South Korean visa?</p> 
22065	Visa for a Chilean citizen joining a tour from a US agency	<p>I have a friend in Chile (Chilean citizen) with whom we wanted to go on a tour in Italy (January 2014).</p>  <p>I am from the USA, and to make things easier, I was planning to order a tour locally from somewhere like Globus or Virgin-Vacation for both of us, and then to arrive to Rome (me from USA, she from Chile) and meet there to start the tour (get picked up by the tour operators to hotel and so on).</p>  <p>However, she had some concerns recently, because she was speaking about this with their local tour agents. What they have told her, is that she could get deported if she does not present the right documentation for her stay in Italy (which I found very odd, but wanted to make sure once again that she will not have possibility of such problems). Another thing that they have told her is that supposedly it is compulsory for her to have tour insurance to be able to go to Italy? (Is this really true? even for me, tour insurance is optional, if I understand it correctly). My gut feeling tells me like those tour agents are just trying to sell her their own tour packages, however, I want to be sure what is true and what is not.</p>  <p>She will have a return ticket, obviously (with a connecting flight most likely in Spain or Portugal). The tour invoice should also include her name and information of each hotel and rail pass there (any problems of it being ordered from tour company in a different country?). I also know that Chileans have no need to have visas to go to Italy or any Schengen area.</p> 
12787	Finding flights to Cuba with a flight search engine	<p>Several of the main flight search tools (Kayak, matrix.itasoftware.com) and the like either won't show or tell you they can't show flights to Cuba due to legal reasons and them being American websites.</p>  <p>Is there a search tool that will? I realise I could go to LAN or Copa or other airline's individual websites, but I'd rather there be an easier way to find flights from, say, DFW to HAV (yes I realise it'd most likely have to go  through another country first).</p>

2310	Which countries, if any, offer on-arrival work visas?	<p>After seeing <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2287/108">this question</a> I began wondering - are there countries that say, Aussies or Kiwis (or anyone else) can get a work visa on arrival, or while in the country?</p>  <p>The best I've found is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html">http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html</a></p>  <p>which indicates availability of working holiday programs, but for several of them (Argentina for example) you are required to apply to Wellington (in my case) before being accepted.</p>  <p>Chile, on the other hand, you can't get one on arrival, but you can apply for one while being a tourist in the country.</p>  <p>So a chart or definitive source of countries where you can basically wander in and start working (legally) would be the ideal answer for this :D</p> 
2287	Where can a middle-aged couple move for a couple of years working holiday and travel base?	<p>I'll try to be specific so that this question is not too open ended and can be answered.</p>  <p>We are vaguely dreaming about moving to a different country to work for several years.  Most destinations are a long way from Australia so we would like to live and work in another country to experience that country and as a travel base to nearby countries.</p>  <p>Some facts about us to make this question specific:</p>  <ul> <li>We are too old (40) for student working visas</li> <li>I have skills in IT/finance and she has skills in hospitality/real estate</li> <li>We speak only English (while willing to learn some local language realistically we would need to be speaking English in the workplace)</li> <li>We would be looking at staying for 2 or 3 years if this is possible</li> <li>Could take a pay-cut compared to Australian incomes so long as we have enough money to live on</li> <li>We are both Australian citizens only (no dual citizenship avenues)</li> <li>It's possible that only one of us needs to work and the other could volunteer</li> <li>We have travelled in East Africa and India/Nepal</li> </ul>  <p>About possible destinations:-</p>  <ul> <li>Developing world would be good (and not say, US, UK, Canada, NZ)</li> <li>A warm place would be better than somewhere cold</li> <li>Location should be a good travel base for the nearby region</li> <li>Obviously we would need to be eligible for a working visa</li> </ul>  <p>What are the options?</p> 
22190	Besides Arab/Muslim countries re Israel, are there other countries which don't recognize passports of any other countries?	<p>It is pretty widely known that quite a few Moslem and Arab countries do not recognize Israeli passports because they don't recognize Israel as a country.</p>  <p>I am pretty sure there are other places recognized as countries by most other countries, but not all; and/or places recognized as countries by only a minority of other countries.</p>  <p>Which, if any, countries do not recognize the passports of which other countries? Is Israel really the only case <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/22179/is-it-possible-to-travel-to-israel-if-its-not-recognised-by-your-passports-cou?noredirect=1#comment36887_22179">as asserted in a comment on a recent question</a>?</p>  <hr>  <p>Yes I know the term "country" is particularly tricky in this question where some and maybe most people don't regard a place to be a country, but at least that place and some other countries do.</p>  <p>Answers should focus on places which issue their citizens passports. For some places which assert they are countries their citizens have passports issued by another country, as is the case with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, whose citizens can obtain Russian passports.</p> 
16968	Can I use my probationary Australian driver's license to rent a car in the United States?	<p>I got into this driving thing kinda late, which means I have a <a href="http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Licences/GetYourPs/RestrictionsOnPs/P1andP2Probationarylicencerestrictions.htm" rel="nofollow">probationary driver's license</a> from Victoria, Australia that looks kinda like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zuajxGrnHBE/UaQyAyRBeYI/AAAAAAAAOgw/OdfJlTaXHGo/s1600/Vic+Drivers+License1+copy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"> (courtesy <a href="http://angiesommer.blogspot.com/2008/08/drivers-license.html" rel="nofollow">Angie Sommer's blog</a>)</p>  <p>This basically means I've been driving for less than 3 years (these days 4!) and am thus not allowed to drink a single drop of alcohol before driving or rack up more than 5 demerit points/year (vs 10 for full license holders).</p>  <p>In Australia, these make you a leper as far as the major rental companies are concerned, they won't rent to you at any price and the smaller locals that do charge hefty surcharges (often $20+/day).</p>  <p>But now I'm going to the United States.  Can I rent a car there?  (And for what it's worth, I'm well over 25.)</p> 
23696	Do I require airport transit visa at Frankfurt?	<p>I am flying from Mumbiai to Montego Bay via Dubai and Frankfurt as my final destination. Do i require airport transit visa at Frankfurt. i will be having invitation letter from husband and  even visa from Montego Bay.</p> 
24583	Electronic visa having Old Passport number	<p>I have Dubai work permit mailed to me by my employer.

13324	I'm travelling from Heathrow to Toledo in the USA with 2 connections, will I need to see to my luggage before I get to Toledo?	<p>I'm worried as it's my first trip on my own. All my flights are American Airlines and I have connections at Raleigh/Durham and at Chicago O'Hare, however there are no terminal changes, just connection times of under 2 hours, so will my luggage be automatically transferred plane to plane? or will I need to re-check them?</p> 
13464	What harm can be done with a copy of one's passport?	<p>In one of the questions on this site, it was suggested the use of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/6602/141">Dropbox</a> to save a backup copy of your passport, in case you need to proof who you are if your original document is lost. </p>  <p>I like the idea, but what if someone gets access to your Dropbox folders and is able to acquire the copy of your passport.  The same goes for when you leave a copy of your passport at a hotel receptions desk. Once someone has the info printed on that copy, would that make it easier to steal your identity?</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
9484	Where can I find old flight stats?	<p>I'm looking for some old flight stats as Flightaware provides me for the last 4 months. However, I'm looking for flights from the past 5 years. Is there any database that is capable of doing so?  For example, I'm interested in KLM1964 on January 5, 2012.</p>  <p>Specifically, statistics including departure/arrival times, and aircraft type.</p> 
22864	Have I invalidated my own ESTA and if I fly to Mexico does that mean I will not be allowed back into the States?	<p>The ESTA that I entered the States on back in October was due to expire on January 8th. As I wished to stay a little longer (an extra couple of weeks) I searched the internet to see how this was possible. </p>  <p>On another forum I read that you could create a new ESTA, resetting the 90 days, by just filling in a new ESTA form and paying another $14, over-riding the dates already in place. I did this at the beginning of December, thinking it would give me until the end of February to leave the country. I now see that this was not intended for use as an extension and that it is instead intended for people who have not yet entered the country and wish to change their dates.</p>  <p>If I now attempt to 'retrieve' my ESTA online using the original application number it states that is has expired. I guess because I over-rode it with a new application. Am I now in breach and does this mean I will not be able to re-enter the country? </p>  <p>Also, I wanted to fly to Mexico, and then travel around Central and South America and then come back to America (maybe sometime in May or June) and fly home. I understand that Mexico is included in the visa waiver region - even though I will be travelling to other countries, will this also affect my ability to return to the country? Would it be better for me to fly to another country (I've heard Costa Rica is not included in the visa waiver region) and then travel to Mexico later - would this make a difference?</p>  <p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks Jo</p> 
20485	Is there Spanish assistance for connecting flights within the USA?	<p>My parents, who are from Mexico, want to visit the US but they only speak Spanish and they are worried about getting lost trying to get to the connecting flight. We have thought about booking a direct flights but they are more expensive. </p>  <p>Do airlines offer assistance in this cases?</p> 
5687	Can I carry on/check in a child's car seat for free for a flight?	<p>I am not flying with my child. Instead, I will meet my child at the destination of my flight. I have a small backpack and one carry-on bag, which is free for most airlines. Can I carry on additionally a child's car seat? In fact, it is a booster seat. It will not be used during the flight, but will be used in a rental car in the destination city.</p>  <p>To be more specific, I will fly with Delta and JetBlue this time. If checking in the booster seat would be free, that should be the best solution for me. Can I?</p> 
16576	Daisetsuzan (Hokkaido, Japan) Grand Traverse, how hard?	<p>I'm planning a trip to Japan and I'd like to spend one week immerse in Japanese nature. I've read something about the "Daisetsuzan Grand Traverse", which is a 5 days and 55km trekking on a route that connects the Asahi-dake and the Tokachi-dake. I don't usually go for trekking in my home country, even if I enjoy doing it from time to time, so I'm wondering if anyone did that and can actually tell how difficult could be for someone who is not even an amateur trekker (I'm in not in a bad shape, tho). If you also have any other alternative route that you enjoyed feel free to share! </p> 
7775	Is 50 minutes enough time to transfer between Terminal A and C at Newark (EWR)?	<p>We'll be arriving at Newark airport (with two kids under 7) at Terminal A and our flight connection is in Terminal C.

2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>". In one <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa/1214#1214">answer</a> it is said that "international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible". The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p> 
7043	Do I have to enter the UK on my UK passport?	<p>I'm a British National (Overseas), which basically means that while I don't have the right of abode in the UK, I am permitted to visit the UK without a visa. However, my passport has expired, and while it's being renewed, the schedule is a bit tight.</p>  <p>At the same time, I'm an US Citizen, and since I'm only planning to visit the UK, I don't need a visa if I enter on my US passport.</p>  <p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p> 
14604	What are the rules for renting a car in Italy?	<p>I am traveling to Italy next month and part of my trip is to Florence. I would like to rent a car for the day to see the countryside in Tuscany. Some sites I've read say I have to have an international driver's license while others say I do not. I checked and it appears I can easily rent a car from Avis in Florence but I do not see any guidance as to driver's license requirements. Obviously, I am a licensed driver in the US. Can someone tell me what the requirements are based on experience or refer me to a reliable source for this information? </p>

5538	Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?	<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>  <p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p>

25029	How can I effectively haggle for a decently-priced auto ride?	<p>Pretty much wherever you go in India, you'll come across 3 wheeled autos or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw">auto rickshaws</a>, which normally look like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XJ1Ag.jpg" alt="From &quot;A tea but no e&quot; from www.flickr.com/photos/ateabutnoe/213708300"></p>  <p>In some places where you want to get one, there's an office or cabin where you can go, pay a small fee, and get a fixed price for the trip. As long as you can successfully communicate where it is you want to go, this gives a known low price, and you're all set.</p>  <p>I'm told that almost all autos have a meter, and that's how most locals handle it for shorter journeys. However, since it's fairly obvious to anyone looking at me that I'm not a local, and I'm normally trying to get an auto outside of a hotel / bar / office, they never seem to want to use the meter for me....</p>  <p>That leaves two options. One that should be avoided - hop in, give a destination, negotiate a price on arrival. Seriously - never do this, you'll get massively ripped off! The other is to negotiate (haggle) for a fixed price before you set off. This can give a good deal, if you know what price to start at, and how to haggle. It can give a bad deal if you don't!</p>  <p>What strategies can you use to ensure you negotiate a decent price for your trip?</p>  <p>(As an example of variability, on my first trip I paid what I thought was a good price, but turned out to be about 10 times what it should've been. Yesterday I went from my hotel to meet some friends, mid evening, and paid twice what my friends negotiated for my return at the late-night rate!)</p> 
2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
8197	Availability of ATMs and exchange places in Morocco	<p>I'm thinking about going to Morocco, and I would be avoiding the most touristic places. </p>  <p>I've read the question  <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10/when-traveling-to-a-country-with-a-different-currency-how-should-you-take-your">When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?</a> which recommends withdrawing cash using a low/no foreign exchange fees card. However, I don't know if that'll be an option for me. What is the availability of ATMs in the country - outside of major cities like Casablanca and Marrakesh?</p>  <p>If a lack of ATM availability means I'll need to take cash with me,  I was wondering, what currency should I take? Would it be easy to exchange US dollars or Euro, and which should be more popular? Or maybe I should exchange money before and just bring Morrocan dirhams with me?</p>

It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days.

Anyone know if there are tours, preferably in North America or Oceania, where you can see this?</p>

18644	Prepaid SIM card for data in UK, France, and Finland	<p>I want to buy a SIM card with prepaid data plan in UK. I will travel around France and Finland. I'm staying for less than a month, and I expect to use &lt;250 MB. It seems that most plans don't allow data roaming across countries for pre-paid plans.

7690	Renting a car in Chicago with California license on a tourist visa	<p>I'll be visiting Chicago next week as a tourist, and I'll enter the United States with the standard tourist visa. I am a French resident. Three years ago, I lived in California as a student on a F-1 visa. During that time, I took the driving test and got a California driver license, which is set to expire in 2013.</p>  <p>If I ever need to rent a car during the upcoming trip :</p>  <ul> <li>Is it legal to drive in Illnois with a California license?</li> <li>Is the "temporary tourist" status compatible with the use of such a license?</li> <li>Do I need to get additional insurance apart from the rental company coverage?</li> </ul>  <p>Edit: I do not own any French license; that's why I'm asking such a question here. Taking the test here needs months of planning in advance.</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
12823	It is cheaper to buy the whole trip or leg by leg?	<p>I am wondering what is my best option. I am planning a trip to Rio and then to Hong Kong.</p>  <p>The thing is that my dates are flexible so if there is not a huge difference I prefer to go to Rio and stay there as long as I wish and then move to Hong Kong.</p>  <p>When I test my itinerary using Kayak and using the exact same dates I got a cheaper option buying leg by leg than using multi-city as my option which sounds good to me.</p>  <p>As I will pay someone to buy me the tickets (and I can't ask them to check both without paying for both option) I would like to know if anyone has any experience with a similar question to give me some tips.</p> 
20695	Travelling to Canada after 90 days in USA	<p>I am doing a ski season in Lake Tahoe (not working), or at least 90 days of it. I then want to fly to Canada for a few weeks to visit friends before flying home to Australia.</p>  <p>I am an Australian citizen, who will be entering USA on the VWP. My question is, if my return flight to Australia is out of Canada, how long can i spend in Canada, if I've already spent 90 days in America?</p> 
23820	Transit in LA after 90 days in North America under VWP/ESTA	<p>I am from NZ and have spent 90 days in the USA with an ESTA visa waiver, and I am going to Canada before returning to NZ. My return flight is from LA but I have already used my 90 days of my ESTA and have not technically 'left' North America (Canada apparently doesn't count). My question is, how do I catch my return flight from LA? Can I get another ESTA even though I haven't left North America?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
21317	Schengen visa in almost full passport	<p>My Indian passport is almost full, I have 4 blank pages, but not facing pages (1 blank page at the beginning of my passport, one in the middle, and the very last page recto/verso).</p>  <p>Do I need to renew my passport or can I apply directly? The rules are not so clear, do the blank pages need to be facing one another, just be consecutive, or it doesn't matter?</p>

13562	How do you choose a restaurant when travelling?	<p>When travelling almost everyone wants to enjoy a local meal. It's part of the travelling experience. If you're not careful, you may end up in an expensive, "extremely" tourist-oriented place, which may not even represent the local gastronomy.</p>  <p>How do you pick a restaurant? Where do you search for information before travelling? Are there any good online guides? </p>  <p>On the spot what are the dos and don'ts? Do you ask locals? Are they a good source?</p>  <p>Note: The problem with locals is that sometimes they try to be extra nice with you and will send you exactly to places you want to avoid. They don't eat in those places, but it's common that they think it's a nice place for you, since it's always full of tourists :)</p>  <p>One of the problems with most review websites is that restaurants go into a positive spiral. They get attention for some reason. From there, they will attract more visitors due to their position, and of course, those visitors will review them again, reinforcing the spiral. That means one may be losing other, maybe even more interesting possibilities, if only looking at "tops".</p> 
14274	Tipping in Australia	<p>I will be travelling to Sydney and just wanted to know about the tipping etiquette in Sydney. </p>  <p>I have read somewhere that the Service tax is already included in the price and there is no need to tip. Also, in countries like US (NYC specifically), bartenders/waiters are paid minimum wage and therefore there is a culture of paying tips. Is it similar in Sydney?</p>  <p>Is it required to tip the taxi drivers?</p>

25196	Valid Schengen visa in unmarried name and old expired passport, can I travel with both again?	<p>I am a spouse of a British citizen and applied and was granted a Schengen visa from the French embassy last year, which is valid till 2015, this was however in my passport which has my maiden name. I have recently changed all my documents and passport to my married name including getting a new passport. When I got the new passport, my old one was made void by punching 2 holes through the bio data page.</p>  <p>My question is, I would like to go to Spain for a wedding next month, can I travel with both my passports or will I need to cancel the old visa in expired passport from French embassy and then apply for a new visa from the Spanish embassy?</p> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p> 
19283	What are the cheapest sites to find hostels around the world to book?	<p>Always when I'm going to travel to someplace, I book my hostel with precedence.

12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p> 
21994	How to use toilet paper	<p>If someone who has never used toilet paper ever travels to countries where only toilet paper is used - how could one learn to use toilet paper?</p>  <p>One of my (Asian) colleagues who is more of a friend confessed he is going paranoid after knowing the fact that he can only use toilet paper while travelling/staying in the US. He was alright being stationed in Dubai, where bidets/water is used to 'wash'. But no more looking further West. Are there any videos (on dummies)/tutorials that one can watch? Youtube doesn't have a tutorial on this either. Any other suggestions please</p>

When talking about how many items (electronics, jewelry, perfumes, watches etc) we can take in luggage bags and/or cabin bags there is always confusion.

18854	Is it okay to board only the second flight of a return ticket? The return ticket is much cheaper than buying one way	<p>I was browsing flight price at Singapore Airlines website, and a one-way flight from SIN to SFO cost this much:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x1kMl.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>That's quite expensive.

25671	Resource for local cuisines and specialties across Japan	<p>I'm wondering if there's some website that's like a "Foodie's Guide to Japan", or maybe a "Foodie Wiki" covering the whole world including Japan, etc.</p>  <p>I know there are lots of special local dishes all over Japan, many of them are seasonal, only on one mountain or island, etc.</p>  <p>Usually I've found out about these by chance if they happened to be mentioned in a Wikivoyage or Wikipedia article on a prefecture or town, or if I'm somewhere in Japan and a friend says "This dish is very famous from here", or sometimes from looking at what's being sold at Service Areas and Michi-no-ekis along expressways and large rural roads.</p>  <p>But now when I try Googling for local food/cuisine/specialties along with a place name, I'm not finding a lot so I'm wondering if there's some dedicated specialized resource I don't know about.</p>  <hr>  <p>An example, I just found some evidence that Hasaki in Ibaraki grows the most of at least some kind of chilies / peppers in Japan, but when I try to track down more details, Google is proving to be insufficient. Where else can I turn to?</p> 
14051	VWP question regarding re entry	<p>I entered the USA on a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) on 1 July 2012 and stayed until 16 Sep 2012 (78 days).  On what date in 2013 will I be able to travel to USA again under VWP?</p> 
6266	What to use instead of credit cards in Iran?	<p>I've read that it's not possible to pay for stuff by international credit card like debit cards. What do you recommend to do in such a situation? As far as carrying a lot of money is not safe at all.</p> 
23622	Who pays for the return ticket when a country refuses entry?	<p>If I am on a tourist visa, and refused entry into the intended touring country, then who pays for the return ticket?</p>  <p>I would assume I will have to. But if I have no money of any kind, then what happens?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
7410	Booking flight tickets together or in separate parts?	<p>I'm flying from A to C via B with Norwegian. Booking flight ticket from A to C costs 285.20 euros. If I buy flight ticket first from A to B and then from B to C, total price is 253.20 euros with exactly the same flights. Both total prices include luggage. Why booking the flight in parts is cheaper than buying the whole flight at once? What's the catch?</p> 
2312	What happens if you miss a connecting flight?	<p>What happens if you book tickets through an airline or travel agent, but on the travel date miss a connecting flight (either because the first flight was delayed, or because immigration/security took too long at the connecting airport)? Will you be put on the next flight for free? Are you expected to pay for a new ticket or a change fee? I'm specifically wondering about Continental/United, but also curious about airlines in general.</p> 
22114	Boarding a train in India at another station	<p>I have booked a ticket on a train from Mumbai to Chennai and boarding at Pune. Since my schedules have changed, I will be in Mumbai on that day. Can I board the same train in Mumbai in my own ticket and claim the seat/berth?</p> 
24359	How can I find bundled air fare discounts?	<p>I recently used <a href="https://flightfox.com/">Flightfox</a> to book a flight from Monterrey, Mexico to London.  The cheapest flight I found was US$1109, Flightfox found one for $959.  It was well worth my $49 fee.</p>  <p>However, I'm puzzled as to how they found me this bargain price.  The flight they found for me included third flight, which I didn't use (and indeed couldn't use), from San Jose, California to Reno, Nevada, on Alaskan airlines.... on a date I was in the UK.</p>  <p>The retail price on this trip was roughly $1300, and I got it for $959.</p>  <p>Somehow by bundling this flight with my round-trip fare from Mexico to the UK, I was able to save money.</p>  <p>How was Flightfox able to find this deal? How can I find them myself--assuming that's even possible, without some special agent mojo?</p> 
25657	Train from Nice to Monaco during Grand Prix weekend	<p>I am staying in Nice for the Monaco Grand Prix and will be travelling by train to and from Monaco on Saturday and Sunday. Can I book an 'open' return for each day rather than selecting a train time for each journey? I would like to book the tickets on line before I travel. </p> 
25016	Is free camping permitted in Japan?	<p>I'm planning to go to Japan this summer, and after visiting a relative, I'm planning to go on a hike for 5 to 7 days.</p>  <p>I was wondering if camping out in the wild is permitted anywhere in japan, like it is in Scandinavia. I don't mind about the costs, but I just like the solitude and the idea of pitching your tent wherever you want.</p>  <p>I'm particularly interested in going to Hokkaido, maybe to Daizetsusan National Park.</p> 
4091	What are the wild camping regulations in Iceland?	<p>I've read <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1340/where-is-wild-camping-possible-in-europe">here</a> that "<em>in Iceland you are allowed to do this by law as long as you stay away from houses and use common sense like you say</em>". Wild camping in Iceland is one of my ideas for the next summer. The question is what does it means "stay away from houses"? And what should be understand as "common sense"? For instance, if I rent a car to move along the island, may I stop at the side of the route with the car and camp? Of course, I'm not talking about the Ring Road. I'm thinking in secondary trails.</p> 
7741	Random camping along Central and South Californian coastline	<p>I'm from the UK and I am planning on spending about 6 days driving from San Francisco down possibly as far as San Diego and then back up again.</p>  <p>I'd love to stop at random beaches/interesting places along the way and doing a bit of surfing/sight seeing and then move on. Since I clearly lack any planning I don't want to book hostels in advance. Will I be able to wing it this freely without getting stuck with nowhere to sleep?</p>  <p>I'm thinking if I see a reasonable motel along the way then great but if not am I allowed to just drive off road a bit and put up a tent? Or if it is not strictly legal will I get away with it? There is only two of us.</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
25809	How to fly with a spider	<p>I'll be visiting Brazil soon, and a friend of mine in Mexico City is a bit of an arachnophile, and has asked me to return with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_whiteknee_tarantula">Brazilian Whiteknee Tarantula</a> for her.  I realize there are likely legal obstacles to doing this, but lets assume that I have that all worked out. (Legal question <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/25810/444">here</a>.)</p>  <p>Practically, how can one fly with a tarantula, without injuring the animal, and without scaring the !@#$% out of airline staff?</p>  <p>If it matters, it would be roughly a 15-hour transit, with a 1.5-hour flight followed by a 10-hour flight.</p> 
25810	What are the legal implications of exporting a tarantula from Brazil to Mexico?	<p>I'm not sure if this fits on this site or not, since it boils down to a question about animal import/export.</p>  <p>As mentioned <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/25809/444">here</a>, a Mexican friend has requested a rather odd souvenir from Brazil: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_whiteknee_tarantula">tarantula</a>.</p>  <p>What are the legal implications for export from Brazil, and import into Mexico if I were to try to fulfill her request?  Is this even legal?</p> 
6024	Checked baggage size limits	<p>I am going to be flying Emirates, which limits checked baggage to 30kg, but doesn't appear to have specific size limits for luggage. I am going to be buying some new luggage and I would like to minimise potential issues when flying with other airlines. Do other airlines tend to have specific size limitations for checked baggage and what might they be?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
21650	Must I enter Europe with Schengen visa from the country where I applied?	<p>If I applied for a Schengen visa from "country A" and I got the visa but I had some commitments in "country B" and I have to finish it before going to Europe should I get back to "country A" to travel to Europe or can I use the visa from any where? </p> 
2589	How to prevent "Delhi Belly"?	<p><em>Montezuma's revenge</em>, <em>Aztec two step</em>, <em>mummy's tummy</em>, or <em>Cairo two-step</em> in Egypt, <em>Kurtz Hurtz</em> in Uzbekistan, <em>Bombay belly</em> or <em>Delhi belly</em> in India.</p>  <p><em>A case of the sh--</em> or <em>Hershey Squirts</em> or <em>The McSh--</em> in North America, <em>Down Under Butt Chunder</em> in Australia, <em>Karachi crouch</em> in Pakistan, <em>Suryavarman's Revenge</em> in Cambodia.</p>  <p><em>Kabulitis</em> in Afghanistan, <em>holiday tummy</em> in United Kingdom, <em>Bali belly</em> in Bali, or <em>Taghazout Tummy</em> in Taghazout or <em>Kathmandu quickstep</em> in Nepal.</p>  <p><em>Beaver fever</em> in Canada, Thailand it's <em>Thai-dal wave</em>. Peacekeepers to Arabic-speaking countries have called it <em>yalla yalla</em> (Arabic for "fast, fast").</p>  <p>In Central Asia, it was ridiculous, with every second backpacker walking around with toilet paper on them, regularly having to make a 'run' for it. In Egypt, half my tour group got sick, by the time we'd converted into a mobile pharmacy!</p>  <p><strong>Regardless of what it's called, what's the best way to try and prevent it?</strong></p> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm. I'm an Indian national and have a valid US visa.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay airside?</p>  <p>I have been scared that British Airways have stopped a few people from boarding flights (no details just rumors).</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay landside? I want to do some sightseeing. What are the chances of getting past officials using transit without visa concession?</p>  <p>Real stories will help a lot to calm the butterflies in my stomach.</p> 
7319	Is it always wise to book flights as soon as possible?	<p>So I'm booking flights to go to Europe in September n October.</p>  <p>And it's a long way off, but I've already noticed in the space of a week or so, that the prices have started creeping up. Not by much, but I've just realized that generally, the prices I was quoted a week ago is now a little bit more expensive.</p>  <p>Then again, out of interest, I've looked for earlier flights in like August or July, and some are even cheaper, so I don't know if it's just the general fluctuation of prices or if the flights on the dates I've set are really getting more expensive.</p>  <p>I kind of presumed that airlines have a kind of first in, best dressed type policy where the first couple of seats they sell on a flight is cheap then progressively more expensive?</p>  <p>But is that how it works? If so, on any given flight, a seat is not going to be any cheaper than it is now and therefore I should just book as soon as I can. Or should I be holding out for a while and monitoring prices until I get the price that I want and buying then? </p> 
11618	How to find decent airfares when you need to travel urgently due to personal circumstances and only for a very short time?	<p>Having a global dispersed circle of friend and family, it happened already twice that I needed to travel urgently because of serious personal circumstances. When I had to travel to the deathbed and subsequent funeral of a relative, I even paid twice the price of normal first class ticket for an economy ticket. </p>  <p>When you are confronted with an urgent situation in your family (death or serious illness) how can you find a more economical airfare? I don't mind paying more then normal, but the fares airlines charge you for very short and urgent trips are often outrageous. </p> 
1372	What is some useful software for brainstorming/planning long trips?	<p>I'm planning on taking my partner and his family on a trip around the UK next year, and I have a ton of ideas in my head that I want to have written down in some form that makes it easy to edit and move things around. So I'm looking for suggestions for software that ideally makes it easy to enter information about transport and hotels, as well as thoughts on potential destinations, day trips, etc. I have used <a href="http://www.tripit.com/" rel="nofollow">TripIt</a>, but it requires me to be a bit too specific with dates and times, I want something that is more flexible and lets me brainstorm without pinning me down to certain things.</p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
8754	Is there an online community to find travel partners (for mountains, sightseeing etc.)?	<p>Is there an online community to find travel partners for mountain trekking or sightseeing or anything else?</p>  <p>I don't want to travel to foreign mountains alone, but I don't know where to search company. There's a great community for accomodations (I mean <strong>CouchSurfing</strong>) so I think there should be something in "reverse" direction (searching not the place to stay but the people to go with).</p> 
25631	Stopping overnight at London Heathrow - do I need an arrival visa and what kind?	<p>In May I'm stopping at Heathrow Airport for 24 hours, on the way to New York from New Delhi. I'm an Indian passport holder and I have a 10 year US visitor visa.</p>  <p>Can I leave the airport and which visa would I need for that?</p> 
5046	How to find historical airfares?	<p>Is there a way to find out how much it <em>would have cost</em> to buy a particular airplane ticket at some point in the past?  </p>  <p>For example, how could I find out how much it would have cost to buy a one-way itinerary from airport A to airport B on October 1, 2011 for travel on November 1, 2011?</p> 
21347	Why do hotel booking sites ask for the number of people? Does it matter how many I say?	<p>I was planning a stay at a hotel in Chicago for an overnight layover and checking prices on the hotel's booking site (in this case the Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport) for a room with 2 double beds. The site asks for the number of people in my party. In my case there will be 3 adults, no kids.</p>  <p>I experimented with different answers to the # of adults question and found that 1-2 people sharing a room gave a price of $94, for 3 people it was $118, and 4 people raised it to $142. </p>  <p>I don't get the extra charge since it will be the exact same room in all of those situations. Do most hotels do this? If I just book the room specifying 2 people and bring a 3rd is there any risk involved? </p>  <p>I'd also like to hear any insight from hotel insiders about what is behind the logic of charging different rates for the same room depending on how many people will be in it (assuming you don't need an extra roll-away bed). It would make sense if there was a free breakfast or something, but this hotel doesn't offer that.</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
7144	In the context of air travel, are layovers different to stopovers?	<p>In a recent question somebody <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7140/how-does-customs-work-if-my-layover-is-in-a-third-country">asked about a <em>layover</em></a> without mentioning how long the stop would be, thus implying it might perhaps be understood whether <em>layover</em> generally refers to a stop not requiring an overnight stay.</p>  <p>In Australia where I'm from we don't really use <em>layover</em> but we're familiar with it from American TV and movies, in which travellers never appear to take breaks between flights to stay a few days.</p>  <p>In Australia we do use <em>stopover</em> (it can also be spelled <em>stop over</em> and <em>stop-over</em>) and very often we do take a break on our flights, because they can be very long, to stay one night or many nights in a destination other than our ultimate destination.</p>  <p>So is it that <em>layover</em> means a short break where you just hang around in the aiport and <em>stopover</em> means a long break where you'll spend some nights in a second place en route to your destination?</p>  <p>Or is it that both words mean a stop, either short or long, and the only difference is which is the more popular in each country?</p>  <p><strong>As evidence that they're not the same:</strong></p>  <ul> <li>We currently have two separate tags: <a href="/questions/tagged/stop-overs" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'stop-overs'" rel="tag">stop-overs</a> and <a href="/questions/tagged/layovers" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'layovers'" rel="tag">layovers</a></li> <li>The post <a href="http://maphappy.org/2012/03/the-difference-between-a-layover-and-a-stopover/" rel="nofollow"><strong>"The Difference Between a Layover and a Stopover"</strong></a> on <code>maphappy.org</code> states "Technically, though, a stay in an intermittent city under 24 hours is a layover.

25558	What constitutes "studying" in the UK for visa purposes?	<p>A <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/25537/444">comment on this question</a>, points to a <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/informationForInternationalStudents/visasAndImmigration/ifYouHaveANon-StudentVisa.aspx" rel="nofollow">document</a>, which specifies that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>You cannot study in the UK with General Visitor or Business Visitor permission</strong> and you cannot register at LSE if you have permission as a general visitor for any kind of programme of study.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What constitutes <em>study</em>?</p>  <p>During my 2-month stay in London, I took several walk-in dance classes.  Would this technically be a violation?</p>  <p>What about something more regular, but not accredited? A 6-week Karate course, for instance?</p>  <p><em>Do I ever need to worry about accidentally taking an illegal course or class?  Or will any eligible institution know to ask for my residency/visa status before admitting me?</em></p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
16266	Can I bring my desktop computer as check-in baggage on a flight?	<p>I am moving from Malaysia to the US, and planning to bring my desktop computer with me. I plan to pack it in my checked-in luggage. Will the computer risk being damaged? Any precaution should I take to reduce this risk? Will there be any trouble with the airline or immigration about bringing computer?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
23820	Transit in LA after 90 days in North America under VWP/ESTA	<p>I am from NZ and have spent 90 days in the USA with an ESTA visa waiver, and I am going to Canada before returning to NZ. My return flight is from LA but I have already used my 90 days of my ESTA and have not technically 'left' North America (Canada apparently doesn't count). My question is, how do I catch my return flight from LA? Can I get another ESTA even though I haven't left North America?</p>

4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
17362	How should I wash clothes in Japan?	<p>I'm going backpacking for a month in Japan and I plan to pack lightly. So I have couple of questions about how I can wash my clothes in Japan. </p>  <p>I expect laundromats to be quite common in big cities but what about little towns in rural area (for example, Hokkaido)?</p>  <p>I'm used to washing my clothes in hot water, but I've read that clothes are washed in cold water in Japan. How different is from what I'm used to? Do I have to use different detergents and/or in a different way?</p>  <hr>  <p>I asked couple of questions here but since they are all pretty much related to the same topic I don't think it would be useful splitting this question.</p> 
25584	Book connecting flight, but only board at second airport?	<p>I'm looking to book flights from) Philadelphia (PHL) to Detroit (DTW). Direct flights are quite expensive. I noticed, in expanding a search to surrounding airports, that I can book from Allentown (ABE) to Detroit for <strong>far</strong> less, and the connection is through Philadelphia.</p>  <p>Can I book this flight but board in Philadelphia? I'll be traveling with carry-on luggage only, so on the return, it's obviously no problem. But would I be allowed through security and on to the plane in PHL with out having flown from Allentown? </p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
26008	Travel from Lyon to Geneva Airport (French side)	<p>I'll be in Lyon for a few days in June (taking a train from Paris) and plan on renting a car to use around Lyon. It sounds like I can drive from Lyon to the French side of the Geneva airport and drop off the car. Is that possible? Should I take the train instead? My flight is at 12:30 p.m. on a Tuesday. </p> 
18019	Someone else is booking international ticket for me using their credit or debit card. Do they need to be present physically at the time of check in?	<p>If someone else is booking international ticket for me using his credit or debit card, does he need to be present physically at the time of check-in? </p>  <p>Suppose I am coming back from Singapore to my home country and my ticket is booked by my friend for me, who lives in my home country. Do airlines in Singapore ask for the person to be present physically to check in? </p> 
11239	When visiting Brisbane, how can you work out if you should get a GoCard, or the new SEEQ one?	<p>The last time I was in Brisbane, the standing advice was to get a <a href="http://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card" rel="nofollow">GoCard</a> to use on Buses / Trains / Ferries, as it was quick to get and the savings over paper tickets quickly made it worth while. You can even get the $5 deposit back at the end of your trip, so there's nothing to lose!</p>  <p>I've noticed that since my last trip, they've introduced a new visitor focused card, the <a href="http://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/seeq-card" rel="nofollow">SEEQ card</a>. There seems to be lots of advertising for it, suggesting to visitors that it's the best thing to get, but without a lot to explain why.</p>  <p>Is there any easy way to decide if, as a visitor, you're best off getting a regular GoCard, or if you should go for a SEEQ one? </p>  <p>(I still have my GoCard from last time, but some people staying here don't have either yet and are unsure of which to opt for)</p> 
2041	London on public transport: what kind of tickets to use?	<p>I'm visiting London for a couple of days, and planning to use public transport while there. </p>  <p><strong>What kind of ticket(s) would it make most sense to use?</strong> Do I get the most value out of single tickets, day travelcards, an Oyster card, or something else? (I'm guessing the Oyster card is more geared towards residents of London, but I'm not sure.)</p>  <p>I'd mostly move around in central London (within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_1">zone 1</a>) with accommodation being located a little further away (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stations_in_London_fare_zone_2">zone 2</a>). Most probably I'd take several trips each day (some of which might be during rush hour).</p>  <p>Bonus question: while I would surely be using the tube the most, are the same tickets generally valid for buses too? </p> 
22888	Is a flight number unique for the schedule, origin and destination?	<p>For example, if we have a flight with a code <code>SU0102</code>, does it always goes from Sheremetyevo to John F. Kennedy or the origin and destination points can change for this flight? The same about schedule: does a flight <code>SU0102</code> always leave at 15:40 and arrives at 17:10 or the hours can change?</p>  <p>In short words, can the schedule, origin and destination change for a flight with a certain number and if so is it frequent?</p> 
25975	Schengen visa "refresh"	<p>On August 17th I need to visit a conference in Germany. The problem is that I already have a Schengen visa valid until 9th of August.</p>  <p>I might not be able to get a new one before my flight to Germany, because, as far as I know, embassies take at least a week to give visas (also, airlines require visa information several days before, so the "window" is less than a week). The one I have now was given by the consulate of Spain.</p>  <p>I am a citizen of Russian Federation and I live in Moscow.</p>  <p>Is it possible to apply for a new visa before the one I have expires? </p>  <p>I've tried googling, but the data I found was full of contradictions.</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
983	Can I get warfarin in Tajikistan (or nearby?)	<p>I've run into a major problem, requiring urgent Warfarin.  However, am in Khorog, Tajikistan, and there's NONE in town, and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country, save for the 5 tablets in my bag.</p>  <p>My question is, <strong>what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for (NZ passport), which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin</strong>.</p>  <p>I have an entry visa for Russia if need be - if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...</p> 
2346	How can I determine which airlines are relatively safe?	<p>The world is full of different airlines ranging from ones with proven track records of safety and security to ones with old, poorly-maintained planes that are falling apart. Are there any resources for travelers to help determine which airlines are widely considered safe to fly?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
23820	Transit in LA after 90 days in North America under VWP/ESTA	<p>I am from NZ and have spent 90 days in the USA with an ESTA visa waiver, and I am going to Canada before returning to NZ. My return flight is from LA but I have already used my 90 days of my ESTA and have not technically 'left' North America (Canada apparently doesn't count). My question is, how do I catch my return flight from LA? Can I get another ESTA even though I haven't left North America?</p> 
24341	What is typical buy/sell spread in cash exchange booths for EUR, USD in Serbia?	<p>What spread (buy vs sell exchange rate difference, %) can be typically expected in cash currency exchange booths in Belgrad airport, Terminal 2? In rural regions of Serbia (e.g. Kopaonik)?  Interested both for EUR and USD.</p>  <p>(follow up from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/24267/serbia-which-currency-typically-has-the-smallest-spread-buy-vs-sell-in-exchan#comment40997_24270">this thread</a>)</p> 
12953	What cheaper alternatives exist to transport luggage in Europe?	<p>I will be flying from Portugal to the Netherlands but I will be only taking hand luggage. What is the cheapest ways of bringing more luggage (excluding the air plane)? (around 30kg).</p>  <p>This question can be extended to Europe. It's not the first time I have had this problem. What is the most affordable way of transporting luggage if you don't carry it along with you while travelling?</p>  <p>Note: Usually companies like TNT and UPS mainly work with other companies. If you ask them a quote it's either very expensive or you will hear a "No". Mail services are usually very limited in weight and are very expensive.</p>  <p>Note2: feel free to give any comment on time constraints. I think this may be useful. I've been in both situations: Where the time for my belongings to arrive was not very important and the opposite while travelling for short periods.</p>  <p>Note3: This question is getting more relevant with low cost plane companies charging extra for luggage. E.g.: When you travel from A->B->C, sometimes it would be very nice just to have things shipped directly from A to C. You may save money and you travel light.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
26261	Boarding point change for an Indian rail reservation	<p>I booked a train ticket on the Yeswantpur (Yeshvantapur, YPR) to Calicut (CLT). I gave my boarding point as Yesvantpur (YPR). My reservation is from Yeswantpur. Am I entitled to board at Karmelram (CRLM)?</p> 
16192	How to send baggage from US to Australia?	<p>We are planning a trip to Australia. We are going to spend some months there and we would like to take with us more than the current baggage limit. One option would be carrying in the plane just what we strictly need, and sending the rest of the things (between 3 and 4 large suitcases) by boat (we don't mind if it takes several weeks, or if it is not a door-to-door service). We though this was possible... however, this seem to be expensive: the best estimates we could get are around $2000 (container spaces, or international moving companies).  Maybe our research wasn't pointed in the right direction... do you have any advice?</p>  <p>We are travelling from LAX (Los Angeles, California) to Melbourne.</p>  <p>Edit: this would be a one-way service. It doesn't matter if we can't bring everything back.</p> 
11594	Is there a ZIP code I can enter when paying-at-the-pump in the USA with a foreign credit card?	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kQL2im.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>In the USA, many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_at_the_pump">pay-at-the-pump</a> fuel dispensers that accept credit cards require a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code">5-digit numeric zip code</a> that corresponds to the billing address of the credit card.  In Canada, for instance, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada">6-digit alphanumeric postal codes</a>, so it's not obvious what you're supposed to type in since the gas dispensers have only numeric keypads.  Entering '00000' or '90210' seems to always result in failed authorization.</p>  <p>Is there a zip code that works for credit cards with foreign billing addresses?</p> 
9263	How to get to Mythbusters' duct tape island	<p>After watching the <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/photogalleries/duct-tape-island/pictures-02.html">Duct tape island</a> episode of the MythBusters show I was totally in love with that uninhabited island. They say it is in Hawaii but no more details. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RvncW.jpg" alt="duct tape island"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9KHv9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><strong>Whats the name of that island? if it has one!</strong><br /> <strong>Is there a way to actually get to it and spend a night or two there?</strong></p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
14853	What is wrong with eating while walking in Japan? It doesn't seem to be an issue in other Asian countries	<p>I have seen on many etiquette questions about Japan that this is a no no, but I can't seem to find what the reason for this is. I know that in countries like Taiwan or China it doesn't seem to be an issue at all, so I would like to know why there is such a difference.</p>  <p>Also, does this also apply to any public places, or just while moving around?</p> 
22043	Miles and more for a family	<p>I recently registered to the <a href="http://www.miles-and-more.com/">Miles&amp;More</a> frequent flyer program and I was thinking all flights I buy with reference to this frequent traveler number can earn points (miles). </p>  <p>For example, I bought two tickets for my parents and another time I bought return tickets for my wife, my daughter and myself. Finally only the miles I got are from the tickets I personally used (flight), not the relatives. </p>  <p>Is this a classic normaly way to count?  Do I need to make a different card (number) for each member of my family? </p>  <p>It looks strange to make a card for a 2 year child, isn't it?</p> 
19241	Can a normal backpacker obtain a multiple-entry Chinese visa while on the road?	<p>I'm an Australian citizen backpacking around Southeast Asia, currently in Bangkok. I would like to criss-cross China several times on this trip to visit some of its neighbouring country by crossing land borders. So I need to apply for a multiple-entry tourist visa for China.</p>  <p>At the time I originally asked this question I had hunted for information on this and finally found <sup>(on a <a href="http://www.visaforchina.org/KUL_EN/visainstruction/256948.shtml" rel="nofollow">page</a> that's now a dead link)</sup> what seem to be extra prerequisites for multiple-entry tourist visas that are not necessary for single entry visas:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>(vii) If applicant can furnish one of the following documents, applicant may apply for multiple-entry L-Visa:<br>   (1) Real estate certificate in China (original and photocopy); or<br>   (2) Notarized kinship or marriage certificate (original and photocopy); or<br>   (3) At least twice China immigration entry records and photocopy.  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Another site user has found <a href="https://visasdirect.com.au/china-visa.php" rel="nofollow">another current page here</a> with a similar list.</p>  <p>I don't even know what some of these things are. Does this mean it's not possible for a backpacker to get a multiple-entry visa? Does anybody have experience with this? Would the fact that I'm not applying in my home country present an extra problem?</p>  <p>If the rules or the actual practice of the application process varies from country to country, is Bangkok a better or worse place to apply, or would I be better off postponing it and applying in another country in Southeast Asia?</p> 
9004	Male nerd here, how on earth can I listen to an "otohime" / "sound princess"?	<p>The other day, I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan#The_Sound_Princess" rel="nofollow">"otohime", also known as "sound princess"</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Many Japanese women are embarrassed at the thought of being heard by   others during urination (see paruresis). To cover the sound of   bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously   while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process.   As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was   introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound   of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand   name commonly found is the Otohime (音姫, lit. "Sound Princess," also   homophone with a legendary goddess Otohime)</p> </blockquote>  <p>As a male, is it possible to hear one in real life?</p>  <p>Do they exist in mixed gender / unisex toilets? If so, where are mixed gender toilets most common? (I haven't noticed any in my previous two trips)</p>  <p>Otherwise, should I try finding an otohime in an Akihabara shop, or possibly some sort of museum?</p>

22271	UAE Tourist Visa validity and how many days I'm allowed to stay?	<p>I'm an Indian and my brother has been working in Sharjah around ten years. It is the first time I'm travelling abroad. He arranged me a tourist visa of 60 days validity and I can stay there up to 39 days (as stated by the visa agent). I should leave on the 40th day. </p>  <p>But in India my travel ticket agent said that I can stay there up to 29 days and I should leave on the 30th day.</p>  <p>I have added my visa image below. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QqX6c.jpg" alt="Redacted UAE Tourist Visa"></p>  <p>Could someone please clear up the confusion for me?</p>

3983	Packing a cardbox box as checked luggage	<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3748/flying-with-a-desktop-computer-as-checked-luggage">another question</a>, I'm planning on traveling with a desktop computer as checked baggage. After considering the options, I've decided to take it in its original cardboard box (used for shipping), making sure to pad everything inside very well.</p>  <p>What should I do to securely prepare the box before checking it in? Some suggestions others have given me so far:</p>  <ul> <li>Spray paint the box black so it's not obvious there's a computer inside.</li> <li>Wrap the entire box with duct tape to reinforce it.</li> <li>Use tape to seal the "hand holes" on either side used for carrying the box.</li> <li>Run packing tape around all the edges to reinforce the box.</li> <li><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3984/what-do-fragile-stickers-on-checked-baggage-do">Write "FRAGILE" on multiple sides of the box.</a></li> </ul>

12870	What does "copy of itinerary" mean when applying for a Schengen visa?	<p>The Italian consulate website says under requirements for a Schengen visa:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Applicants for short term visas (up to 90 days) <strong>must also present an itinerary of their trip</strong>.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>What does this mean? This is separate from the proof of return ticket:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Return-trip booking or proof of available means of personal transport:   ticket reservations for round-trip flights originating in our jurisdiction to Europe (and ultimately to Italy) and back, including internal entry and exit points of travel i.e. EURORAIL tickets, car rental, internal flights. The names of reservations should reflect the name on passport. The applicant may be required to show the actual ticket when picking up the visa;</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>When they ask for an itinerary, what documents need to be shown?

26348	Getting a Schengen visa without firm travel plans	<p>My girlfriend and I have South African passports with 5 year ancestral visas for the UK valid until 2018; we've been working here for a few months and have UK bank accounts. We're planning on saving up our earnings to tour around Europe in a few months. We don't know where exactly we'd like to go or for how long - just go where we want when we want.</p>  <p>A Schengen visa would be ideal as it would open a few countries to us. However two Schengen requirements may pose a problem:</p>  <ol> <li>We require tickets in and out of the Schengen zone (not much of a problem since we could get ferry/plane tickets from and to the UK a few weeks apart).</li> <li>We require proof of hotel books or offers of accommodation from whoever we're staying with (this is the big issue as we don't know where we want to go).</li> </ol>  <p>Does anyone know whether not having firm travel plans would absolutely prevent us from being granted visas? Does it make a difference that we are UK residents (we have UK bank accounts and an address we can use but not Right of Residence or citizenship) or that we have leave to return to the UK after our Schengen visa would expire?</p>  <p>Surely you can go to the Schengen zone without knowing where we want to go or exactly where we want to be on a certain date; isn't that the point of a Schengen zone - one visa for all countries?</p>

16617	How to convince airport security that I am not dangerous when having metallic parts in my body?	<p>I had an operation some time ago and now I have small screws in my shoulder which will not be removed anymore. When I decided to fly for vacation, I supposed that these will may bring me into trouble at the airport when going through the metal detector.</p>  <p>So I asked my doctor and at the hospital if there is any kind of "passport" or something similar which confirms the screws in my shoulder so that I do not get into many problems. Unfortunately, they told me such things do only exist if you get a new knee or something, not if you just have a few screws in your body.</p>  <p>When I flew from Vienna to Amsterdam and back, my fears were confirmed: The security staff inspected me very precise, and I had to explain them my story. Thank god I have some scars left so they believed me!</p>  <p>However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any international "passport" which my doctor and hospital do not know about? If not, what else are my possibilities?</p>  <p>I am not that afraid when travelling within the EU, however I fear that this situation might get quite dangerous when I'm in other countries...</p>

I'm a fairly light traveler with the exception of my equipment which is just a little more than I can carry at one time.  I don't have any gigs scheduled per se. But if an opportunity were to arise, It would be nice to have my equipment available.  I was wondering if there was a way to ship my equipment for storage until I needed it.  When I do need my equipment, I could request that it gets shipped to a specified address.  </p>  <p><strong>Is there such a service? Or is this merely a business plan?</strong></p>  <p>As a side note, I don't have anybody within my reach that I can trust to have my stuff shipped in a timely fashion.</p> 
25745	Do I need to carry my passport while travelling within the Schengen area?	<p>If I have already entered the Schengen area, when am I required by law to carry my passport?</p>  <p>Basically do I need it when I</p>  <ul> <li>Travel within the same city</li> <li>Change cities</li> <li>Board a flight or a train</li> <li>Cross borders</li> </ul>  <p>When I was in Europe I had two completely different incidents with me and I wonder which was legal and which strictly was not?</p>  <ol> <li><p>I was asked for my passport on the Metz, France train station while leaving for Luxembourg. Note: This was <strong>NOT ON</strong> the train but simply on the station because I was clearly a foreigner.</p></li> <li><p>I was able to travel to Italy from Metz without my passport when I had accidentally forgotten it and had already boarded the train towards Italy. I was also able to come back and my passport was never asked for. I was traveling on a <em>EuRail Pass</em>.</p></li> </ol> 
24730	One-way USA to Switzerland without a return ticket	<p>I am flying from the USA to Switzerland with a one way ticket. I will also be flying from Switzerland to Spain and be traveling around in Europe but I do not have a return ticket because I am not sure from which country I will be departing from. Would this be an issue for the airlines?</p>  <p>I am flying through American Airlines and Iberia.</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
18478	Is it easy to get a visa for France if one already has a visa for the UK and applies from the UK?	<p>For a Russian citizen:</p>  <p>If I have a general purpose (6 months) visa for the UK, and am currently in the UK, does that make it easier to get a visa for France.</p>  <p>For example: I'm in the UK on the general purpose visa for a 3 month holiday, and I would like to visit Paris. So if I wander into the French embassy in London are they likely to give a French visa easily on the basis that I already jumped through all the hoops for the UK visa?</p> 
26491	How to access the internet during a road trip in the USA?	<p>I'm traveling from Europe (Belgium) to USA soon. While on a road trip from New Orleans to Miami, I'd like to access the internet without paying exorbitant amounts of money on roaming fees. I was thinking about getting a pre-paid SIM card from an American provider to lower the costs.</p>  <p>It seems hard to order a pre-paid SIM from an American provider without an address in the USA. What are my options?</p> 
26262	How far away from artificial light do you need to get to experience the night sky without light polution?	<p>Twice this week I stumbled upon an article mentioning phenemenons visible with the naked eye if no artificial light is near by. The first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/791226314231715/?type=1">was a series of meteorites</a>, the second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience/photos/a.456449604376056.98921.367116489976035/796854660335547/?type=1">a photo experiment on how the night sky would look without artificial light</a>.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7oyr.jpg" alt="cities withou light here"></p>  <p>The question is how far I need to travel away from a well lit city or road to experience such beautiful skys?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
16040	Are laws about sex outside marriage less rigorously enforced in Dubai for people on layovers?	<p>Last night, I read on the news that Qantas was switching its main hub from Singapore to Dubai.</p>  <p>Smart Traveller <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/United_Arab_Emirates">notes</a> about the United Arab Emirates:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Homosexual acts and sex outside of marriage: Homosexual acts and all   kinds of sex outside of marriage are illegal and may lead to severe   punishment, including imprisonment and fines. Foreigners have been   imprisoned for having sex with people to whom they are not legally   married. De facto relationships and civil unions are not recognised in   the UAE and any sexual acts within these relationships are considered   to be sex outside of marriage. It is also against the law in the UAE   to live together or share the same hotel room with someone of the   opposite sex to whom you are not married or closely related. If   checking into a hotel as a couple, you may be asked by management to   prove that you are legally married. These laws apply equally to UAE   residents as well as visitors.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Should I assume that when Smart Traveller says that the laws apply equally to visitors, that includes even people who are just on layovers? Or are the laws less rigorously enforced for people on layovers?</p>  <p><strong>Background:</strong> I'm not planning on engaging in homosexuality, adultery or fornication in Dubai, but I'd rather not financially support airline routes that would expose fellow passengers to the risk of jail.</p> 
3410	Will I get in trouble if I drink beer in public in Dubai?	<p>As far as I know, Dubai is a Muslim country. And as far as I know, it is forbidden to drink alcohol in Muslim countries. Is this also true for Dubai and tourists?</p>  <p>So as a tourist can I drink alcohol in public? And should I? And are there any special rules during Ramadan?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
14909	The website says the Eiffel Tower is sold out for two months. Is there anything I can do?	<p>I went to the <a href="http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/" rel="nofollow">Eiffel Tower web site</a> looking to buy tickets for an upcoming visit, and found that, except for a few days, it is sold out for basically two months. I am guessing that it is not truly sold out because a friend was recently in Paris and said he was able to walk up and buy tickets on the spot. Of course, he was visiting it at night on a weekday. I'll be visiting in the daytime on a weekend. Does anyone have any suggestions for alternative sources of tickets, or recommendations for when to arrive to have a chance of buying tickets on the day of the visit?</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Read my answer below for my experiences visiting the Eiffel Tower.</p> 
9198	Sunrise/sunset photographic opportunities at the Grand Canyon	<p>I'm hoping to get a great view of the sunrise at the Grand Canyon.  I'll be staying in Williams, and will be there the first weekend of September.  Where is generally (on the South Rim) considered to a great view of sunrise and / or sunset?  I understand the park is open 24 hours a day at the South Rim.</p> 
277	Is the weight limit for AJ Hackett's Macau Tower bungee jump followed strictly?	<p>The official website for <a href="http://macau.ajhackett.com/products/index.html" rel="nofollow">AJ Hackett's Macau Tower bungee jump</a> states in its conditions that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Must weigh 40 kgs</p> </blockquote>  <p>This seems to be a really low limit, and I was wondering whether anyone has personally done the jump or knows someone who did, to confirm whether this is a rule they actually stick to strictly. Or am I misinterpreting the 'Must weigh 40 kgs' as <em>maximum</em> 40kg, as opposed to <em>minimum</em> 40kg?</p>  <p>(I did email them but they never replied.)</p> 
7860	Walking back down Grouse Mountain, after doing the Grouse Grind?	<p>While I'm in Vancouver next week, I'm (weather permitting) planning to do the <a href="http://www.grousemountain.com/grousegrind">Grouse Grind</a> hike up Grouse Mountain. Once up at the top there, I expect I'll do a few of the trails around the top, but then there's the question of getting back down...</p>  <p>The normal option, so I understand from the website, is to take the cable car back down the mountain, at a current cost of $10. What I'm wondering is if there are any other options?</p>  <p>I get the impression from the grouse mountain website, and a few other places, that the grind route is supposed to be one way only (up!), so I guess that option is out? Are there any other hiking routes back down instead? And if there are other trails, are they well signed, or will I need to buy a map? (I'll want to get back to somewhere with a bus back to downtown Vancouver, if that affects things)</p> 
6572	Good mountains to camp on in Japan	<p>I'm planning a trip to Japan next year.  It will be my first time there.  While there, I'll probably spend a few days hitting up the major tourist attractions, but I'd also like to spend some time camping in a mountain.</p>  <p>The obvious choice is Mt. Fuji, but after <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/fuji-san/150415" rel="nofollow">googling about it</a>, that may not be such a good idea (going to a camp ground that gets 2K campers daily during its peak season seems to defeat the purpose of camping).</p>  <p>Are there any good recommendations for a mountain in Japan which:</p>  <ol> <li>Has campgrounds near the peak which usually aren't too crowded</li> <li>Has a trail that goes to the peak (I don't mind the physical side of it, I just don't hang from ropes and don't plan to)</li> <li>Stays away from Fukushima, preferably west or south west of Tokyo</li> </ol>  <p>I'm okay with travelling off of the mainland as long as there is something like a ferry which can get me to/from the mainland.</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
25500	Cheapest accommodation in Motobu, Okinawa?	<p>I'm interested in finding the absolute cheapest place to sleep overnight in Motobu, Okinawa.</p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be any hostels on the usual websites but I've noticed that there seems to be a kind of "flophouse" in Okinawa that I've never encountered in other parts of Japan. In fact I'm staying at one now in Naha for 1,000 yen per night (roughly $10). I think some of these call themselves "share houses" in English. But outside Naha they might not use English? Most of the guests are middle aged Japanese staying long term. Others including backpackers stay a night or a week.</p>  <p>I don't know what these places are called in Japanese, how common they are, or how people normally find them.</p>  <p>For the purposes of this question I'm not too worried about luxury or quality. The place I'm in now is messy and even in some respects a bit dirty, but the people and atmosphere are great.</p>  <p>I'm interested in any type of cheap accommodation including campgrounds.</p>  <p>(I know I could sleep outside or try CouchSurfing or a similar website, but I don't consider those to be what this question is about.)</p>  <p>The reasons are there's a ferry that leaves from Motobu and that I'd enjoy staying a night or several in a part of Okinawa where there are no tourists.</p> 
18295	Are inexpensive ryokans inauthentic?	<p>A lot of people I talk to, including Japanese and non-Japanese, claim that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_%28Japanese_inn%29">ryokans</a> are expensive.</p>  <p>Once, when I discussed this further and said that some places that I've been to describe themselves as ryokans and aren't expensive, the other person speculated that maybe it's not a real ryokan, and doesn't offer the same services a "real" ryokan does.</p>  <p>I found this very plausible, and I joked that maybe just offering a futon on a tatami mat would be enough to fool me into thinking that it's Japanese-style accommodation.</p>  <p>Examples of inexpensive (at least to me) ryokans include <a href="http://kumagairyokan.com/service.html">Kumagai Ryokan</a> in Morioka and <a href="http://www.kimiryokan.jp/">Kimi ryokan</a> in Ikebukuro.</p>  <p>I've heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_%28Japanese_inn%29#Minshuku">minshukus</a>, but none of the places I've gone to have called themselves that.</p>  <p>Are inexpensive ryokans inauthentic?</p> 
14623	What happens if you cannot pay for a hotel?	<p>What happens if you cannot pay for your hotel stay because you accidentally run out of money (can happen) or your credit card was blocked (much more likely)? I assume you cannot arrange the money on your own in different of ways (like e.g. money transfer).</p>  <p>Are they allowed to hold your passport until you come back and pay? What happens if they call the police? Are you going to be fined? Can the police or other authorities lend you money in this or other more critical situations?</p>  <p>I know this can be a general question about what happens if you run out of money while being abroad, but a hotel is the most common travel-related post-paid service.</p> 
1786	How do I get money back for my foreign coins?	<p>Tonight I just cleaned my room and while doing this I found some money. I counted it and I found out that there are a lot of coins from 25 different countries.</p>  <p>I know that normally banks don't exchange foreign currencies in coins, but is there a way so that I can still get some money for my foreign coins?</p> 
1596	Changing unusual foreign currencies in London	<p>I've just returned from several unusual countries in Asia, and annoyingly despite being told I'd have no problem, I'm unable to find anyone in London to change back to pounds.</p>  <p>I've tried Travelex in Heathrow, a currency exchange place, and the post office.</p>  <p>The currencies include cash from: Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>  <p>Most of the responses when shown the money is to the tone of "What the hell currency is this?" which doesn't fill me with confidence.</p>  <p>Any suggestions welcomed for places that may change this. Otherwise I may need to go back next year ;)</p> 
6397	From whom can I buy travel insurance if I don't "live" anywhere?	<p>I am an Australian citizen, currently living in Singapore and I want to travel through Europe and the USA over the next six months. I will be leaving Singapore permanently and my intent is to ultimately land back in Australia, at least for a while, but this may not happen.</p>  <p>From whom can I buy travel insurance? Most consumer travel insurance plans which offer the type of cover I want (Covermore et al) assume you have a "country of residence". Effectively, I don't and that would invalidate my policy.</p>  <p>As a bonus, I'd prefer if I could specify I'll only be in the USA for three weeks and only pay the extra premium for that time, rather than it doubling the cost for the whole six months.</p> 
22679	How do I travel with musical instruments?	<p>How can I travel to another country (by plane) and take my instruments with me?</p>  <p>I live in Greece and I want to go to the USA with my double and electric bass.</p>  <p>I found <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/4961/how-can-i-travel-with-a-double-bass">this</a> question, but it is limited to traveling <em>in</em> the states.</p> 
1031	How can I fly with a guitar?	<p>During my upcoming holiday to the USA I'm thinking about buying a new guitar as the exchange rate is extremely favorable. Excuse my naivety but I have never flown with a guitar before. What is a recommended way to go about this? Could I take it as carry on luggage or would it have to be checked? If checked luggage what kind of precautions should I take to keep it safe? Are there any problems with flying US budget carriers? If I do buy the guitar I'm expecting to have to make two flights with it, one domestic flight with Virgin America and an international flight with Air NZ.</p> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm. I'm an Indian national and have a valid US visa.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay airside?</p>  <p>I have been scared that British Airways have stopped a few people from boarding flights (no details just rumors).</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay landside? I want to do some sightseeing. What are the chances of getting past officials using transit without visa concession?</p>  <p>Real stories will help a lot to calm the butterflies in my stomach.</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year.

10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p>

7968	Can US cards be used in countries with chip-and-pin systems?	<p>I'll be visiting the UK in a few weeks, and I understand that the UK credit/debit card system works on a "chip-and-pin" system. As far as I can ascertain via Google, US cards don't have this system on them. I've also read on some websites that certain readers will not process cards without the chip-and-pin, but I'm not sure how widespread such readers are. </p>  <p>With that in mind, is it likely that my US-issued card  will be generally usable in the UK and other countries with the chip-and-pin system, or should I be ready to exchange cash? In addition, does credit/debit make a difference in this regard?</p> 
13855	Magnetic stripe or EMV (chip-and-pin) credit cards in France?	<p>We are US travelers who will be spending 2 weeks in France (Bordeaux through Provence to Nice) in mid-April 2013.  We understand that Europe is well ahead of the US in the use of EMV (chip-and-pin) technology for credit cards, and all of our cards are traditional magnetic stripe only.  We would like to use a credit card for as many expenses as possible.  We will be using public transport as well as renting a car, purchasing gasoline, etc.</p>  <p>What is the current state of EMV vs. magnetic stripe card acceptance in France?  Should we inquire about EMV cards with our card issuers?</p>

26589	How to extend my stay in the Schengen area at the end of my trip?	<p>I'm a US American, I'm currently visiting my brother in Germany, my 90 days visa is expiring in June, do I need to go back to the states, if so, how soon can I return to Germany? Or can I request to extend my visa, if so, which embassy should I go to request the extension of my stay?</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
26794	Is it possible to extend my 90-day short stay in Sweden by 10 or 15 days?	<p>I am a Canadian Citizen, visiting Sweden for 90 days without a visa. Is it possible to extend by just 15 days? If so, please provide information as to where I can find out how much it would cost and how to do so if you can.</p>  <p>The reason being, all the flights before the 91 day mark are about 200+ dollars more than after that date.</p>

I will also be flying from Switzerland to Spain and be traveling around in Europe but I do not have a return ticket because I am not sure from which country I will be departing from. Would this be an issue for the airlines?</p>  <p>I am flying through American Airlines and Iberia.</p> 
25207	Why do you need a valid US visa as an Indian citizen, to transit via Europe?	<p>This was catalyzed by a question on the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/25134/2236">need for a Schengen visa for Indian citizens</a> and the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/25174/2236">discussion that followed</a>. </p>  <p>The question I posed is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I have a valid US (F1) visa. Does that mean I can transit this way:   India-EU-Madagascar (because that's the cheapest ticket - hypothetical situation). Then   what? What does having a valid US (F1) visa have to do with transiting   via/through EU. A valid US F1 visa doesn't mean one can enter the USA.   As a student you also need a <strong>valid I-20</strong>. So to reiterate: why the   rule about US visa = no need for EU transit visa?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Besides hearsay (which I am open to as long as it is rational <code>;)</code>), is there some link/article that explains this requirement? </p> 
10930	Can I take chocolate to Australia?	<p>Australia is well known for having very strict rules on what food and plant-based materials can be brought into the country, to try to keep the country free of diseases. Some food/animal/plant things can never be brought into the country, some may be if suitably declared, and a very small number are always fine.</p>  <p>What's the situation with chocolates though? I'd quite like to take a nice box of chocolates with me as a gift for someone when I go to Australia, but only if I'll be allowed to take them in. Does anyone know what the rules are for chocolates? Are they a never / usually ok if declared / normally fine thing?</p> 
12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
26574	Switzerland and Paris tour query	<p>I am from India and currently in UK for short term work assignment and have a valid 1 year UK Visa.   I want to visit for 5 days in Switzerland and return back to UK and then after 2 weeks, I want to go to Paris for 3 days. I have made above planning as I will be travelling with my wife and kid.</p>  <p>How do I apply for Schengen Visa so that I can get visa that allows me to travel both places as per my above planning?</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
16581	Does browsing ticket sites in incognito mode and/or from different IP's result in cheaper ticket prices?	<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1caomf/what_are_some_useful_secrets_from_your_job_that/c9es3w2">a discussion</a> yesterday where industry insiders share tips relating to their respective fields. Someone who works in e-commerce stated :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"When purchasing items on the internet (especially airline tickets),   use incognito mode on your browser. We use your own cookies against   you: raising the price on tickets the more times you check, as you   shop around for better deals. That way you'll think the price is going   up or that seats are being actively sold - thus increasing your   urgency to buy, and punishing you for trying to get a good deal."</p> </blockquote>  <p>and </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"The point is that it's not enough to just shop around to different   websites on your own computer anymore. You have to shop around with a   clean browser, different browsers, different computers, change of IP,   maybe try from work then RDP to your home computer or somebody on the   other side of the country, etc. Also, always call the airline directly   and check on the price - sometimes it's much cheaper."</p> </blockquote>  <p>Do these tactics indeed work when purchasing tickets online?</p> 
24980	Language problems at the airport?	<p>I have a family member who speaks Romanian but not English, French or any other world language. If she flies alone, how can she pass through the control points (immigration, customs) at the airport?</p>  <p>Would it work if she brings a sheet with translations of the common questions and answers? Do airports (CDG in particular) have interpreters available for most languages? Is there any arrival card (for France) she will need to fill?</p> 
3040	Do I need a visa if I go with a cruise line to St. Petersburg?	<p>Last week I discussed with a friend if it is necessary to get a Russian visa if you travel with a cruise liner to Saint Petersburg in Russia? I think so, but my friend has the opinion that it is not necessary since you're accomondation is not in Russia but on the "international" cruise line. Who is right?</p>  <p>I have to edit my question to clarify something: I'm not asking if I need to care about the visa by myself or if the tour operator does it. I already did that this summer and I know it can be a PITA. I want to know if I need a Visa at all. </p> 
26012	Can a Guatemalan/Spanish citizen enter Guatemala with an expired Guatemalan passport?	<p>My girlfriend and I will be visiting Guatemala, together.  She is Guatemalan, and now has Spanish citizenship as well (along with a Spanish passport).</p>  <p>Her Spanish passport is current, but her Guatemalan passport has expired.</p>  <p>Will this pose a problem for her when entering Guatemala?  Which passport should she present?</p> 
13494	Claustrophobic - travelling for the first time long RSA to USA	<p>I am trying my best to prepare for my upcoming flight to the USA, the trip is all under control, its just the flight that I'm terrified of.  I am very claustrophobic and do not even ride in elevators, I flew once locally for 1.5 hours. But my second flight will be 2 X 10 hours flights from South Africa to USA. </p>  <p>So please, I need to know, what it would be like, if I'll be OK on such a long flight, what can go wrong? And what do I need to be aware of.   </p> 
26792	What will happen if I overstay in Sweden by 1 day?	<p>I am a Canadian Citizen going to Sweden on the 90 day visa-free short stay. I am wondering if it is a big deal to over stay by one day. I'll be arriving on the 30th of May and I want to leave on the 28th of August (which is one day over). The cheapest flight I can book is on that day, otherwise I have to pay about 100 - 200 dollars more for an earlier flight.</p>  <p>(Keep in mind, I can't afford to cause problems that would prevent me from being able to come back to Sweden, as this is where my girlfriend lives, and I plan on moving there eventually) </p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
3363	Laptop Searches by Customs - UK and US	<p>I'll be traveling to the UK (London) on a study abroad in the spring and will be bring my laptop for school and intern purposes.  I was just curious what/if any rights UK customs has to search laptops at the border, and how common laptop seizure and search is when returning to the good old U.S.A.</p> 
24686	Is it dangerous to go to the USA as a Russian now?	<p>I am a Russian student and I have been dreaming about visiting California and living in LA for a while, and I decided to take this trip on my summer break. I have already accumulated enough money for a ticket and contacted various employers, basically I have job for those two months I am going to stay there negotiated.</p>  <p>But I am kind of worried now considering the international situation. What kind of attitude can I expect these days? Would it be dangerous for me to go to the USA now or would the people be negative towards me? ( I have my opinion, which is contrary to official Western media portrayal of the Crimean crisis, but I am not going to make conflicts over this with anyone, I've grown out of phase of 'defending my point' at any cost, especially when I have no influence - stoicism. )</p>  <p>How friendly would the people be towards me once they realise I'm from Russia?</p>

5813	How can I extend my stay in Europe for longer than 90 in 180 days?	<p>I am an Australian citizen and I wish to base myself in Amsterdam for four or five months. As an Australian I get to <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/TravelBulletins/Europe_Schengen">stay in the Schengen area for a cumulative 90 days in any 180 day period without a visa</a> and the <a href="http://english.ind.nl/residencewizard/">Netherlands does not allow me to apply for a holiday visa for more than 90 days</a>. But I want to stay for longer than that. I have enough money to support myself and I do not intend to work.</p>  <p>Other than spending a cumulative month or two in England, Ireland or Bulgaria, is there any kind of visa I can get (from another Schengen country?) in order to extend my stay? </p> 
14621	Are 7 hours enough time to leave the Brussels airport and go to the city center?	<p>I have a seven hour layover at Brussels airport, and I'd like to know whether there is enough time to leave the airport and go into the Brussels city center for a beer or a meal?</p>  <p>If so, what transportation is available, how does it work, how long does it take, and how much does it cost?  Are there convenient luggage lockers in the airport so that I can avoid taking my carry-on luggage into the city?</p>  <p>This layover is from 8:30 in the morning to 15:30 in the afternoon on a Monday, and the flight is arriving from the United States.  The outgoing flight is within Western Europe.</p> 
805	Travel insurance with a pre-existing condition	<p>I have ulcerative collitis. It's not particularly bad. I'm trying to get travel insurance for two different holidays (one to the US and one to China/Japan). Unfortunately having ulcerative collitis means that a lot of companies either won't cover me or want to charge me the earth for cover.</p>  <p>Could someone recommend a UK-based insurer that does reasonable rates for people with pre-existing medical conditions?</p> 
5556	Modifying online flights to include stopovers	<p>I'm trying to get a visa for Canada, but that's beside the point. While I wait, I play with flights online, looking at prices.  I found that occasionally there's this weird multi-stop flight that shows up from Auckland, New Zealand to Nadi, Fiji, to Christmas Island, Kiribati, to Honolulu, USA, to Vancouver, Canada!</p>  <p>Now, these only have stopovers of like 1-3 hours, so it's for a refuel or to drop off passengers.  Certainly not enough time to get off.</p>  <p>However, if it were possible, I'd like to change the flight to include stopovers of a day to a week - I'm not fussed - I'm flexible, but I'd love to spend even a day in some of these places. </p>  <p>Most online booking sites don't seem to include stopover functionality, however.  Kayak allows you to display only flights with a certain length stopover, but this is in the  realm of hours, merely to let you configure it not to strand you in <a href="http://www.sleepinginairports.net/worst-airports.htm#.TznUHJWXdO0">Manila or LAX</a> for too long.  </p>  <p><strong>Is there a way to search online flights to configure stopovers of days in length, or do you have to book separate flights?</strong></p> 
21671	How can I book a flight plan found on Matrix Airfare Search?	<p>When I find a flight I like on the <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/">Matrix Airfare Search</a>, it spits out a bunch of travel agent secret codes™.  If I look for the same flight on the airline's web site, I often get much higher rates.

26780	Is there a flight search engine that combines flights from different airlines?	<p>Is there a search engine that considers "mix&amp;match" flight combinations?</p>  <p>My current problem: I need to go from FRA to YLW (Frankfurt/Germany to Kelowna/Canada) on July 29th, and arrive no later than 5pm. The search engines I checked only offer €3000+ flights.</p>  <p>I found a 2-stop combo through LHR and YVR for half that price. I'll probably have to check my baggage out and back in twice, but if the layover times are long enough, who cares?</p>  <p>A <em>real</em> search engine could find that for me (or something that's even better). Or, hell, give me a place to bulk-download the flight schedules from and I'll program it myself (of course I'd also need a way to check seat availability …).</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Please read before answering. A search engine which does this should, at minimum, show the flight combination through LHR which I found manually. Note that I need to arrive before 5pm, <em>on the same day</em>.</p>  <p>Also note that this is a generic question; I'm not looking for a specific good flight here -- but the details are useful to illustrate whether an answer is actually valid. :-/</p>  <p>NB: Typo, should have been July 29th.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
26095	How to behave on a US visa interview?	<p>I am planning to apply for a US visa soon to see one of IT conferences and from what I heard, in order to get the document I will need to meet one of US embassy representatives. Trying to imagine what such an interview looks like, I have to admit I completely don't know how am I supposed to behave then. For example, am I supposed to wear a suit, or are casual clothes okay? What are the topics I should not talk about?</p> 
5148	How common are onsen that require swimming costumes in Japan?	<p>I <a href="http://www.julieinjapan.com/2007/07/japanese-onsen-etiquette.html" rel="nofollow">assumed</a> that you don't need a swimming costume when going to an onsen, but I came across <a href="http://www.secret-japan.com/forum/onsen-in-and-around-tokyo-t312.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> mentioning that some places require swimsuits (it mentions Tokyo ones require them more than rural ones). This saddens me a bit, as it apparently means 1) Japanese culture is being eroded by western influences 2) more luggage.</p>  <p>How common is this policy? Is this mainly the case in tourist traps rather than more traditional onsen?</p> 
16568	Where can I exchange Paraguayan Guaranies in Santiago, Chile?	<p>I recently flew from Asunción to Santiago (Chile), and when I arrived at the airport, I discovered that the money exchangers there do not buy Guaranies (Paraguayan currency).</p>  <p>I've been checking around town, but I haven't yet found a place that will exchange my Guaranies for Chilean Pesos.</p>  <p>Where can I trade my Guaranies in Santiago?</p> 
965	Using an Amazon Kindle onboard a flight?	<p>Airlines don't let you use electronic devices when the plane is taking off/landing. Let's suppose I have a Kindle 3, and I have turned off wireless (i.e. both Wifi and GSM/3G is off). </p>  <p>Since you don't need power or the battery to read what's on the screen (the magic of eInk displays), it's technically 'off' when I'm reading it, right? </p>  <p>Can I still use it when the flight is taking off? Have any national aviation authorities passed judgement on this?</p> 
23610	UK landside visa queries	<p>I am planning to travel from Chicago to Delhi via London with intention of ~36 hrs in transit.</p>  <p>I am Indian resident, with valid US visa (until 2015).</p>  <p>Going by UK border agency information <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/transitthroughtheuk/visa-to-transit-landside/" rel="nofollow">here</a> I will be needing land side visa.</p>  <p>I have following queries:</p>  <ol> <li>Is it possible to get the land side visa <strong>on arrival</strong> or do I need to apply prior to leaving US?  </li> <li>If it is on arrival, and for some reason I am denied, will I need to wait for connecting flight within airport for that long?  </li> <li>What is the procedure and fees? I scanned through the UK border agency site, but could not find a procedure, and further details. It seems very scattered.  </li> <li>I see that one of the flight option has 48 hrs 15 min difference. Can landside visa be applied for this case?</li> </ol> 
27012	Is there a discount on train tickets for people older than a given age in the Netherlands?	<p>I am helping a friend to plan a trip in the Netherlands. He is 68 years old. Is there some discount on the train like in Belgium?</p> 
27040	Are there any websites or other resources that lists discounts or special conditions for seniors in Europe?	<p>In some countries seniors have special conditions on the train, museums, etc.</p>  <p>Relating a comment on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/27012/is-there-a-discount-on-train-tickets-for-people-older-than-a-given-age-in-the-ne">this question</a> I was wondering if there are websites or resources that list special conditions for seniors.</p>  <p>Such resource would be very helpful to encourage them to be more active.</p> 
23622	Who pays for the return ticket when a country refuses entry?	<p>If I am on a tourist visa, and refused entry into the intended touring country, then who pays for the return ticket?</p>  <p>I would assume I will have to. But if I have no money of any kind, then what happens?</p> 
22630	Is there a reason why airlines prevent laptops from being used during takeoffs and landings even though some allow tablets and smartphones?	<p>Airlines like Delta and British Airways recently started allowing passengers to use tablets and smartphones during takeoffs and landings, yet they still restrict the use of laptops to within the air only. Is there a justifiable reason for this (i.e. safety; regulations), or is this policy just arbitrarily chosen?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
2340	Are there any travel experiences in Australia that offer aboriginal (or Torres Strait) “cultural immersion”?	<p>I am wondering if it's possible for a traveller in Australia to immerse in aboriginal culture, or Torres Strait Islander culture.</p>  <p>By "immerse" I mean stay in a traditional aboriginal area where people speak the language on an everyday basis and generally live to some degree or other in a traditional way. Maybe including staying with a family and being taught some traditional skills or otherwise participating in daily life.</p>  <p>I'm from Australia and work in tourism and I think it's safe to say most Aussies would have no idea if you can do this. But it's a big country and we're pretty ignorant of our native culture.</p>  <p>For me the language aspect is important. I do know the most actively maintained indigenous languages in Australia are in <strong>Central Australia</strong> (Pitjantjara, Arrernte, Warlpiri) and <strong>Torres Strait</strong> (Kala Lagaw Ya). I also believe that traditional culture and language is practiced in <strong>Arnhem Land</strong> by the Yolngu people. But I have no idea about the state of tourism in those areas.</p> 
2338	Are there any travel experiences in New Zealand that offer a Maori "cultural immersion"?	<p>I am wondering if it's possible to travel to New Zealand as a tourist and immerse in Maori culture.</p>  <p>By this I mean homestay in a traditional Maori area where people speak the language on an everyday basis and generally live to some degree or other in a traditional way.</p> 
17895	Authentic Ainu in Hokkaido	<p>During my next trip to Japan I may end up in Hokkaido. I've read something about this mysterious indigenous group called Ainu/Aynu/Aino/Ezo, but I must admit my understanding of the whole thing is rather limited right now. </p>  <p>What I wish to know is: is there such a thing like an authentic Ainu village/town/whole-region where Ainu people live according to their tradition, as opposed to something staged for tourists?</p>  <p>Edit: given the comments below I wish to specify better what I mean with the word 'authentic'. Of course, I don't expect pristine landscapes and Ainu people living in blissful harmony with fluffy penguins (semi-quote) but I won't be surprised to find out there still are authentic villages in remote areas of Hokkaido where mass tourism is not an issue at all.</p>  <p>People are subject to tourist's attention (tourist coming from different countries, at least) everywhere, not only when they "made a conscious decision to live a traditional life". This doesn't actually mean anything. Indian people are surprisingly differents (in local customs) from Italians and Italians take a lot of pictures during their travels there, still the tourism isn't banned in India. </p> 
1615	Travelling by train in mainland Europe, will I save money by booking my tickets early?	<p>My wife and I are planning to travel by train from Nice to Budapest over the course of 2 weeks, stopping at a number of towns and cities on the way.</p>  <p>We'd prefer the flexibility of booking our tickets on the day of travel, but are wary of ticket prices rising the closer you get to the travel date (as happens markedly here in the UK). However, do European train ticket prices generally vary in this way, or would a ticket booked on the day cost the same as one booked in advance?</p>  <p>My initial tests on <a href="http://www.raileurope.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Rail Europe</a> suggest that the price remains constant, but it would be good to get confirmation from someone more experienced in European train travel.</p>  <p>Our route is likely to be: Nice to Verona to Salzburg to Vienna to Budapest.</p> 
16950	What does a couchsurfing host expect from their guests?	<p>Just that. I've never done couch-surfing and I'd like to start couch-surfing in my next trip, but I don't know what the host "expects". Do I have to take something in exchange for his/her offer? Or is it better to invite to a dinner? And about the stay, should I expect to visit the city with the host or alone? </p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student).

24298	What are transit visas?	<p>What is the purpose of a transit visa, under what circumstances is is it required, and what happens when an individual arrives at an airport without one?</p> 
27087	Can you buy Eurostar Brussels-Lille tickets on the day, for the same price as in advance?	<p>As per the answers to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1615/travelling-by-train-in-mainland-europe-will-i-save-money-by-booking-my-tickets">Travelling by train in mainland Europe, will I save money by booking my tickets early?</a>, you should normally book your Eurostar tickets in advance, ideally a few months out (especially for popular trains). </p>  <p>Despite that, there's something a little different when it comes to the 30 minute trip between Lille and Brussels. These are the prices for 4 days time: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXpS6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>It's basically the same thing whichever day I pick - normally only one train offers any class other than standard, the rest only offer non-flexible tickets at an apparently fixed price.</p>  <p>Given that, is it possible to just turn up at Brussels station a bit more than 30 minutes out from the train I end up wanting, buy a ticket for this price and travel? Or do I still need to book online in advance (for one specific train since there's almost no flexible ones) to get this £24 price?</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>(For those wondering why the Eurostar, there's currently only 1-2 Thalys trips per day between Brussels and Lille, normal Intercity trains seem to be almost the same price and take 3 times as long. TGV looks to be slightly cheaper on a special weekend fare, and just as quick, but there are more+later Eurostars than TGVs on the day I want to travel)</p>

5907	Phone calls within countries in Europe	<p>My brother and I are considering going on a <a href="http://www.topdeck.travel/europe-trips/euroclub-htce/spirit-of-europe" rel="nofollow">tour</a> of Europe, that visits 13 countries in 24 days. Most advice I've seen recommends buying a separate SIM card for each country, but that is expensive when you are visiting many countries. We want access to cheap calls/texts that are local for the country we are in as we would mainly be calling each other or using <a href="http://www.rebtel.com/" rel="nofollow">Rebtel</a> if we wished to make an international call/text. Do there exist European cap plans that allow you to use your phone in multiple countries without having to pay roaming charges?</p> 
9662	Can I credit travel on one RailTeam member to the frequent traveller program of another?	<p>I know that with airline alliances and partnerships, you can credit flights on one airline in the alliance/partnership to a frequent traveller program of another. Does the same thing apply for travel with <a href="http://www.railteam.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">RailTeam</a>, which is the partnership of several European high speed rail operators?</p>  <p>I know that if you have suitable status on one RailTeam member (Eurostar, SNCF/TGV, DB or Thalys) that you can get <a href="http://www.railteam.co.uk/for-your-journey/railteam-services/lounges/" rel="nofollow">lounge access</a> when travelling on another in the partnership, so at least some airline-like things apply. What I'm not sure is if I can travel on one RailTeam member, and credit the points to the program of another? Their <a href="http://www.railteam.co.uk/for-your-journey/railteam-services/frequent-travellers/" rel="nofollow">frequent traveller page</a> doesn't seem to say.</p>  <p>(In case it matters, I'm a member of the Eurostar program, and I'm wondering about credit for some TGV journeys I've got coming up)</p> 
1777	What options are there for a 5-hour layover in Kuala Lumpur?	<p>On a trip between London and Sydney/Brisbane, we have a 4-5 hour stopover (between scheduled departure and arrival) at KL in each direction. We're travelling economy class on Malaysia Airlines.</p>  <p>I would guess that we won't have time to leave the airport; I'd be interested in any information about the sort of facilities we might find to kill a few hours (as well as knowing how long the baggage/immigration etc might take). I wouldn't mind spending a modest amount on lounges, for example, but which ones are good there (and would be convenient for our circumstances)? We are infrequent travellers, so anything subscription based is probably not suitable.</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
21932	Can you travel to the UK with an EU national Identity card that is only valid for another week upon return?	<p>For international trips I have a passport, for EU journeys I use my national identity card. Simply because its format is more convenient, since it fits in my wallet.  On my next trip to the UK my national identity card will only be valid for only one week when I return.  I am aware of validity issues on passports (e.g. your passport needs to be at least valid for more then 6 months when traveling to the US), what are the regulations regarding national identity cards in the EU? Can I use it to travel within the EU until the last day of its validity?</p> 
21935	Is an EU residency permit for EU nationals a valid travel document within the EU?	<p>I am a citizen of an EU member state, being a resident in another EU member state. I hold a both a national identity card of my birth country and a resident permit of my home country. In an answer to an earlier question I asked about traveling to the UK with an almost invalid national identity card  it was <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/21933/141">mentioned</a> that at least in the UK I should be given "every reasonable opportunity” to prove I am an EEA national. Given that information is printed on my resident permit, I am wondering to what extend such a resident permit is a valid travel document to travel within the EU. </p> 
6063	Do I need to apply for a visa to enter South Korea as a tourist on an Australian passport?	<p>Do I need to apply for a visa to enter South Korea as a tourist for a few days when travelling on an Australian passport? Or will I be able to get one on arrival?</p> 
11346	Changing passenger name on an Indian Railways ticket	<p>I have booked a ticket on IRCTC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railway_Catering_and_Tourism_Corporation" rel="nofollow">Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation</a>) for me and my brother but now even my sister is willing to travel but we are not getting tickets for her. So my brother agreed to not come and take my sister with me. Can I take my sister on the same ticket which is booked on my brother's name? Or is there a way I can change the name on already booked ticket to reflect my brother's name or is there a way I can cancel the ticket and book the same ticket on my sister's name?</p> 
2939	What can I do to prevent passport stamps being put on blank pages?	<p>I'm running low on blank passport pages which are sometimes needed for full page visas such as those issued by Armenia, India, and Vietnam.</p>  <p>When I crossed the border into Turkey the other day I got my visa-on-arrival and stamp, but instead of putting it on a partly used page, which I have many, the guy at customs and immigration put them on a previously blank page. Now I have one fewer!</p>  <p><strong>What can I do to prevent or at least reduce the chances of this happening?</strong></p>  <p>It's worth remembering that there's likely to be a language barrier and it's always best to be ultra-nice to these border officials.</p>  <p>Has anybody heard of any trick such as sticking bit of paper in your passport, either blank, or looking a bit like visas? I have noticed that nobody ever stamps a page that has a remnant of something once stapled in there in Japan. There is a kind of stub that had its major part torn off along a perforation. Might I be able to emulate this somehow or would that even be worse making the blank pages invalid for full page visas due to having holes from staples? I know some things can get very picky when it comes to customs and immigration.</p> 
2932	Is there a website or list somewhere of which countries need a full page of a passport to issue a visa?	<p>I'm on a huge trip at the moment and have some big plans for after winter if I manage not to spend all my money.</p>  <p>But several of the countries I'm thinking of going to require me to get a visa and I'm running low on blank pages for those countries which require a full page like Armenia, India, and Vietnam do.</p>  <p><strong>Is there a central place where we can look up what destinations require a full passport page for their visas to citizens of which countries?</strong></p>  <p>I'm an Australian citizen and some of the places I'm considering visiting are Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kuwait, Mongolia, Nagorno Karabakh, and Russia.</p> 
27225	How do I decide whether to be worried about having enough blank pages in my passport?	<p>I am planning a long trip over a year from now. The tentative itinerary is</p>  <ul> <li>Canada</li> <li>USA (maybe LA, maybe Hawaii, doesn't matter, I have Nexus)</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>New Caledonia</li> <li>Vanuatu</li> <li>Fiji</li> <li>Samoa</li> <li>New Zealand</li> <li>Cook Islands</li> <li>Tahiti</li> <li>Easter Island</li> <li>Chile (or possibly back to places we have been before)</li> <li>Canada</li> </ul>  <p>I will be traveling on a Canadian passport. All of these countries are (for me) "you can stay 30 days without a visa" or "visa on arrival" except for Australia, which is an electronic visa. </p>  <p>In my past travels, some countries have been pretty good about fitting 4 stamps on a page (eg Bulgaria stamped on the way in and out, but they chose the page that the Netherlands had used for in and out.) However not all have been. Australia put their entry stamp on an otherwise empty page and then found a different empty page for the exit stamp. </p>  <p>I have three blank single pages scattered among the stamped-on pages, and then a stretch of 12 single blank pages running to the end. My passport is one-third full, then, and I have almost 3 years left on it. But I am a little worried this trip will fill it up. If each of the 10 not-Canada, not-US places consumes one page for the entry stamp and one for the exit, I will not have enough pages. But if they're more like Bulgaria was, I'm fine. Further, if travel from New Zealand to the Cook Islands and from Easter Island to Chile is considered domestic, there may not even be stamping involved for those legs.</p>  <p>It is not possible to add more pages to a Canadian passport. It is not normally permitted to renew less than a year before it expires, though you can request it and you need a good reason. "My passport is full" is a good reason. I don't know if "I have calculated my passport will be close to full" is a good reason or not. Further, I don't intend to spend long enough in any place to allow for the time it would take to renew my full passport and continue along my journey, should it become full along the way.</p>  <p>Bottom line: not just "should I be worried?" but "how can I tell whether to be worried or not?" Some specific subquestions:</p>  <ul> <li>is there a way to tell whether a given country uses a 1/4 page standard size stamp, or glues a piece of paper into the passport, and the size of that piece of paper?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance which countries use exit stamps?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance whether trips between countries that belong to each other are domestic (eg LA to Hawaii will not generate anyone a stamp) or not - thinking of the Cook Islands and Easter Island for me, but generally applicable</li> <li>any specific advice about wildly early renewal of a Canadian passport would also be good</li> </ul> 
25522	What's the quickest way from London Kings Cross to Euston, by foot or tube?	<p>My train to London Kings Cross has just been cancelled, so instead of having plenty of time to make a connection to Euston, I'm going to have a mad dash...</p>  <p>To get from Kings Cross to Euston I have a number of options, but given that my train ticket includes an Underground journey, I'm thinking that either walking (fast!) or tube would be my best bet. Given the tight connection, I'm after the fastest way to do it. What would that be?</p>  <p>Based on <a href="http://stations.aeracode.org/#kxx">this 3D model of Kings Cross / St Pancras underground station</a>, I see that none of the underground lines are that close to the Northern Ticket hall where my later train will come into. At the Euston end, I know that Euston Square station is quite a fair way from Euston station itself, which the Victoria or Northern Lines are quite deep so there'd be walking + escalators to get up to the surface (plus the <a href="http://stations.aeracode.org/#kxx">long walk+escalator</a> at the KX end to get to them). Walking wise, not sure which is the quickest way to go, but I suspect it wouldn't necessarily be the "obvious" one along Euston Road.</p>  <p>So, which is the quickest way - tube (if so which) or fast walk (if so which way)?</p> 
12975	Can I take two laptops to India from United States? One bought in India and one in US	<p>I will be landing at New Delhi airport. The worth of new laptop  (Lenovo Yoga Idea Pad 13) is about $1000 and old one (Macbook Pro) is > 1 lakh INR. I want to leave the new laptop in India. I have a copy of bill with me but not the original bill. I want to know if I have risk of being charged with custom duty.</p> 
18708	Does Singapore have an electronics district something like Tokyo's Akihabara?	<p>In a few weeks I expect to be flying into Singapore to start a long overland trip. But my current laptop is dying and I like to have one on my travels.</p>  <p>So I'm pretty sure computers and electronics will be much cheaper in Singapore than here at home in Australia.</p>  <p>What I am wondering though is whether Singapore has an area dedicated to hi-tech... something similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a> in Tokyo where all kinds of nerdy gadgets new and used can be found.</p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p> 
19808	Why do people on airplanes often have tomato juice as a drink?	<p>Tomato juice seems to be a favorite drink for many travelers to have on board an airplane. I've seen this on almost every flight I've been on, but I have never noticed this same trend at ground-level.</p>  <p>What are the reasons for that? Is there an origin of this trend?</p> 
12771	I want to travel to the USA while working remotely for my non-US employer	<p>I would like to travel in the USA for a period of 3 - 6 months. But I want to spend some time working for my employer (remote work) and getting paid by the employer. Is this possible under a tourist visa (B1/B2)?</p>  <p>I hope this is OK since I will not be getting paid by a US employer. I am in the IT trade so all that I will be needing is my own laptop and a connection to the internet. The money I earn would actually help me pay for the expenses I get during the holiday.</p> 
21783	Do I need a transit visa in Zurich on the way to India?	<p>I am travelling from US to India, with an Indian passport but expired F1 visa and going there to get my H1B visa stamping. I have a stop at Zurich for 2 hours while flying to India. Do I need a transit visa for my trip? </p> 
13347	ROC to TYO - how can I reduce the cost of my flight?	<p>I'm trying to find the cheapest flight I can from <code>ROC</code>, Rochester, New York, to one of the airports in Tokyo for a six week study abroad in Kobe. I'm wondering what the cheapest, OR easiest routes from one side of the earth to the other. What connections should I take? Where should I start looking? What prices should I expect? Would it be easier to fly through the US then directly to <code>TYO</code>, or through another country? I should be leaving at the first or second week of June and returning the end of July. </p>  <p>EDIT: I've been advised to clarify my question a bit. What I'm really interested in is ways to reduce the price of whatever I will have to pay, when is the best time of the fly, what sites should I look at to book with, what fees will I have to contend with, should I connect through a foreign country or try to go through the US only.</p> 
983	Can I get warfarin in Tajikistan (or nearby?)	<p>I've run into a major problem, requiring urgent Warfarin.  However, am in Khorog, Tajikistan, and there's NONE in town, and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country, save for the 5 tablets in my bag.</p>  <p>My question is, <strong>what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for (NZ passport), which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin</strong>.</p>  <p>I have an entry visa for Russia if need be - if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...</p> 
18854	Is it okay to board only the second flight of a return ticket? The return ticket is much cheaper than buying one way	<p>I was browsing flight price at Singapore Airlines website, and a one-way flight from SIN to SFO cost this much:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x1kMl.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>That's quite expensive. I tried browsing around and found that a return flight from SFO to SIN and back to SFO cost much cheaper:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FdzuK.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>It's really weird because the second ticket includes the exact same flight that cost 1900+, but it's almost half the price. The reason for this counter-intuitive situation is explained in the answers this question <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11501/one-way-versus-return-airfare-tickets">One-way versus return airfare tickets</a></p>  <p>If I am located in Singapore and my intention is to fly one-way to SFO, is it safe to book the flight in the second picture and only board SFO-SIN leg? Will they deny me because I miss the SIN-SFO flight?</p> 
17641	OK we are all adults here, so really, how on earth should I live without bidet?	<p>This is the part four in the interesting series: "OK we are all X here, so really".

11085	How do customs and immigration work in a sailboat?	<p>So, I have this crazy dream.  I'd love to purchase a little sailboat, make my way down the East Coast, across the Carribean, down South America, and end up in the Falklands, maybe Tierra Del Fuego, and Antarctica if I really could develop some seamanship skills. As I think about the logistics, I realize, it's a bit of an undertaking, but from a skill level, it seems "do-able."  </p>  <p>What has just occurred to me from a planning perspective, however, is that I have just totally  schluffed off the important legal niceties, of oh, entering a foreign country!  But then I realize, a coastline is way bigger than the secured portion of an airport.</p>  <p>So, here's the question.  Let's say I've shoved across from Florida and sailed down to Brazil.  Yes, that's a long trip, but I'm going to guess the islands are a bit more sophisticated when its comes to ports. When I show up in Brazil, what's to stop me from pulling into a harbor, getting out of the boat, walking into the town, and buying supplies?</p>  <p>At what point do I need to show my passport, do a customs declaration or in any fashion present myself to authorities as a gringo who needs to be admitted to the country?</p>  <p>In other words, how do I legally enter a country when I'm in a private sailboat?</p> 
9653	What's a "Redress Control Number"?	<p>When booking a flight reservation recently, I noted it had a non-compulsory field asking for a Redress Control Number for your reservation.</p>  <p>I gather this is somewhat related to the No Fly list, but was wondering if someone could explain how it works and whether it just gets accepted and you're waived through at the gate, or whether it still requires you get some thorough investigation as a result :)</p> 
4609	Which is the fastest and cheapest way to get from Amsterdam to Rotterdam?	<p>I'm looking for the fastest and the cheapest way to get from the center of Amsterdam to the center of Rotterdam for three persons. Should I take the train? A bus? Even a plane?</p> 
6592	What to do if I lost my passport before flight in another country?	<p>I'm just asking this question for my info. I will be traveling from India to Amsterdam on a short trip.</p>  <p>What should you do if you lose your passport or the passport gets stolen (especially in a Schengen country)?</p>  <p>As I read on the Internet that if someone loses his passport, the following things have to be done:</p>  <ul> <li>Contact the airline immediately and change the flight date to at least 2 months ahead because it will take at least 2 months to get a new passport.</li> <li>Contact the nearest police station and file the report of lost passport</li> <li>Go to the embassy of your country to apply for a new passport. This will take 2 months after applying</li> </ul>  <p>Until you get the new passport you will have to stay in town for approximately 2 months. So you should have extra money for that.</p>  <p>Is the above information correct? Please reply if you have a more detailed and more accurate answer.</p> 
1083	What is the best method of purchasing a ticket with an open return date?	<p>I’ve been doing some research on traveling to South America and staying for an extended period of time (working vacation). The usual sources for flight info (Kayak, Expedia, Hipmunk) don’t have any info on flights with open return dates.  The other option would be to just buy a one-way ticket, then buy a return flight when I want to leave, but I’ve heard that international flights from South America are quite expensive.  What would be the most cost-effective solution?</p> 
12765	Is 1½ hours enough for a transit at Munich airport?	<p>I'm heading to India next week and have a connection in Munich, Germany. I made the mistake of booking a flight with only an hour and a half layover (freaking out!) and I'm wondering if I'll have to go through customs in Munich or if I can pass right on through.</p> 
14834	UK Transit Visa from USA to India	<p>I'm traveling to India from the US for my H1 stamping. I'm planning to go via the UK (LHR). I'm changing my visa status from F1 (visa expires in 2015) to H1. Is my visa valid to qualify for a transit visa exemption or should I get a air side transit visa? </p> 
185	Is there a list of free accomodation resources?	<p>I want to travel abroad cheap, and I would prefer to find some place to stay through a person or website, rather than book a hotel or hostel. There is <a href="http://couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a>, which I know about. Can you recommend other resources where I can find free accomodation?</p> 
9204	Is there an easy way to calculate the total cost of tolls for a trip within the United States?	<p>Is there a convenient way to calculate the cost of tolls between two arbitrary points within the United States? I'm planning to take a trip along the Eastern seaboard and will be passing through multiple states with different toll-collecting authorities. The mapping and trip planning resources I've found so far will only indicate whether a particular section of road has tolls, not the price of those tolls. I'm aware that the various toll-collecting authorities post their rates online, but these charts are often difficult to use if you're not already familiar with the area. Isn't there an easier way?</p> 
21783	Do I need a transit visa in Zurich on the way to India?	<p>I am travelling from US to India, with an Indian passport but expired F1 visa and going there to get my H1B visa stamping. I have a stop at Zurich for 2 hours while flying to India. Do I need a transit visa for my trip? </p> 
5234	Is it possible to buy outdoor clothing in Northern India/Nepal?	<p>Another shopping question, but I do think it is on topic!</p>  <p>I will soon travel to India, the first few months I will spend in the south and lower parts of the country where it will be warm and hot. As I like to travel light, I plan to bring only some light summer clothes. </p>  <p>Later I will visit the more mountainous regions in the North and would also like to do some trekking in the Himalayas in Nepal. For that I do need warmer clothes and boots.</p>  <p>I am sure I can just buy any normal warm clothes locally, but I do like my quality outdoor clothes, they are just more practical for several reasons.</p>  <p>But being a long-term traveller with little income, I buy most of my outdoor stuff on sale or even second hand. In other Asian countries I did find special outdoor shops but the prices were the same as the full retail-prices in the west or even higher, usually too high for me.</p>  <p>Do I need to buy my fleece, jacket and hiking boots in Delhi or can I wait until I am further north?</p>  <p>How about Kathmandu, being a place with many backpackers and trekkers? What are the prices like?</p> 
27446	Can I be refused entry due to my place of birth?	<p>Usually entry requirements are based on country of citizenship, but is it at all possible to be denied entry if you were born in a country in conflict with your travel destination ?</p>  <p>This is a specific question that I'm trying to make more general. In my case, I was born in Beirut but am Canadian citizen, always lived here. Not to get into details but technically speaking, Lebanon considers itself at war with Israel, and relations are always tense there. I would really like to visit Israel one day, but I'm wondering if I can be denied entry because my (Canadian) passport says I was born in Lebanon? </p>  <p>I was speaking with an Israeli-Canadian friend and he also thinks that he would never be allowed into Lebanon because he was born in Tel Aviv.</p> 
25817	Will the traffic and parking be easier in York on a week day or a weekend?	<p>Driving up from the Peak District, is driving in to York more busy on a week day or a weekend?  </p>  <p>The former would have regular works, the latter would have more tourists.  I'm not sure what the relative numbers are for both in York specifically.</p> 
26597	Can I get European-wide traffic predictions similar to the one from Paris?	<p>Already in 2004 there exists a really <a href="http://www.infotrafic.com/route.php?region=IDF">neat online service</a> that not only gave traffic information but also the chance of getting into a traffic jam. (see screendump below).</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o10PI.png" alt="Traffic jams in Paris"></p>  <p>I really liked this information since it gives you some indication on when it is best to drive in and around Paris. 10 years later the <a href="http://www.infotrafic.com/route.php?region=IDF#">IDF website</a>, still exist but I find it hard to find the same information for other regions in Europe. It would be so convenient to have this information for for Example the Benelux and Germany to plan ahead when going on a road-trip. </p>  <p>Am I not searching enough or does these visualizations of traffic information for other regions simply not exist?</p> 
27511	What are my accommodation options when doing a road trip in the Czech republic with children?	<p>I am planning a road trip to the Czech republic. Everywhere I read that the czech republic is a relatively cheap destination. However, whenever searching online I can only find quite expensive options (>75 Euro per night). Even camp sites charge quite hefty fees. I suspect that regarding the camp sites, more affordable camp site will be available with camp sites without an online reservation system.</p>  <p>However, what are my options in the Czech republic if I consider camping one side of the spectrum and bungalow park/hotel the other side of the spectrum given that we are traveling with small children. </p> 
26432	What is a good way to get list of sights for a road trip (e.g. for a roadtrip from Chicago to Niagara falls?)	<p>I would like to get a list of sights along the route from Chicago to Niagara falls via Cleveland. </p>  <p>How can one proceed when trying to obtain a list of sights in unknown area for further selection?</p> 
27151	How does the SNCF Voyageur program work?	<p>I'm planning some TGV trips soon, but despite being a member of two different Railteam frequent traveller programs already, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9662/can-i-credit-travel-on-one-railteam-member-to-the-frequent-traveller-program-of">from this question</a> it doesn't look like I'd be able to credit the journeys on a TGV to either of them.</p>  <p>I think, if I want to get any credit for them, I'll need to join the <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">SNCF Voyageur Program</a>. The <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">English language website for it</a> has some broad details about the program, but doesn't really explain much about how you earn credit from TGV journeys, nor about redeeming them. It links through to various French language websites, but these all seem to have even less information on them, with all the important details apparently only available after you log in. (Since joining seems to take about a week, you can't just sign up and immediately see the details, grr....)</p>  <p>If someone with better google-fu than me, or someone who's a member who can log in to the site to get the full details, is able to post about the program that would be great. Specifically, I'm interested in:</p>  <ul> <li>What tickets I can and can't get credit for</li> <li>What's the earnings rate (per segment, per mile, per euro, something else?)</li> <li>How do the different levels work?</li> <li>How do the rewards work?</li> </ul>  <p>Hopefully from that, I can work out if there's actually any point in me joining the program for just a few trips or not!</p> 
25490	If I book a Eurostar ticket through SNCB, how can I attach my Eurostar Frequent Traveller details to the booking?	<p>When looking to book a Eurostar ticket, I discovered that it was cheaper (for this one journey - no promises in general!) to book it via the <a href="https://www.b-europe.co.uk/Travel" rel="nofollow">SNCB English website</a> rather than via Eurostar themselves. So, having double checked the numbers (including credit card fees, also lower with SNCB), I opted to book my ticket on the SNCB website. </p>  <p>However, at no point in the booking process did I spot anywhere to enter my Eurostar Frequent Traveller details. Now I've booked, I can't see how to change it on the SNCB site. If I go to the Eurostar site and do Manage My Booking, it shows the details of the trip, but doesn't let me change anything, so I can't therefore enter my Eurostar Frequent Traveller details there.</p>  <p>The worst case is that after the trip, I can log into the Eurostar website, and do a missing points claim with the ticket details. However, that's a bit of a faff, and I need to remember to do it, no sooner than 1 day after the trip ends, and no later than 3 months. Given that, I'd rather enter the details now while I'm thinking of it!</p>  <p>So, is it possible to attach Eurostar Frequent Traveller details to a booking made via SNCB, or is my only option the missing points claim later (assuming I remember....)</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm. I'm an Indian national and have a valid US visa.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay airside?</p>  <p>I have been scared that British Airways have stopped a few people from boarding flights (no details just rumors).</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay landside? I want to do some sightseeing. What are the chances of getting past officials using transit without visa concession?</p>  <p>Real stories will help a lot to calm the butterflies in my stomach.</p> 
6740	7 hour layover in LHR - enough time to visit London for a couple of hours?	<p>My flight <strong>lands around noon</strong> at LHR terminal 5 and my connecting flight <strong>departs</strong> also from terminal 5 at <strong>7pm</strong> the same afternoon. Will that give me enough time to take the express train into <strong>London (Paddington</strong>) for a short (say <strong>2 hour visit</strong>)? </p>  <p>I am mostly concerned with the return to terminal 5 and going through security (I will already have my boarding pass at that time).</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
19478	Travel implications when going to Muslim countries after a visit to Israel	<p>I would like to visit Israel, but I have heard that if you visit some Muslim countries, they won't let you in, and visa versa.</p>  <p>Does it depend on which Muslim countries?  I imagine there would be different policies say between Egypt and Iran.  Does the order of visit matter?  How can 'they' tell you have been to a particular country, is it by the stamps in your passport or what?</p>  <p>I am on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>I have visited Malaysia and Indonesia (Bali) in the past (with a stamp in my current passport)</p>  <p>I would like to visit Israel.</p>  <p>I would like to visit the following Muslim/Middle eastern countries:</p>  <p>Egypt, Jordan (Petra), Turkey, Malaysia again.</p> 
26954	Is it a good idea to carry printouts of scanned documents in lieu of original documents to an interview for a B2 visa for USA?	<p>I am staying in USA on a H1B visa. I am planning to sponsor a B2 visa in USA for my parents who are living in India. I am on the way to prepare all sponsor documents. I am aware that for  the B2 visa interview, my parents have to carry sponsor documents along with other documents. After completing of the documents, I would like to scan all those documents and send those scanned copies to my parents through e-mail so that they can carry the printouts of sponsor documents to the B2 visa interview.</p>  <p>Is it good idea, or do we have to carry original documents for the B2 visa interview?</p> 
7043	Do I have to enter the UK on my UK passport?	<p>I'm a British National (Overseas), which basically means that while I don't have the right of abode in the UK, I am permitted to visit the UK without a visa. However, my passport has expired, and while it's being renewed, the schedule is a bit tight.</p>  <p>At the same time, I'm an US Citizen, and since I'm only planning to visit the UK, I don't need a visa if I enter on my US passport.</p>  <p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p> 
25290	Can I merge points from different flight companies to use in Star Alliance?	<p>If I have points in multiple Star Alliance member companies, can I sum up all these points to get a Star Alliance flight ticket?</p> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
489	Are there currently any international ferries that travel to Saint Petersburg, Russia?	<p>Years ago I was in Europe and decided it would be a great idea to go to Saint Petersburg by ferry since it is regarded as a beautiful city and is a port. I didn't mind departing from Finland, Estonia, or pretty much anywhere else. I only wanted to arrive by sea as this was the whole point.</p>  <p>I could not find at the time details on the Internet, Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, or travel agencies about where to depart from or if any international ferries even existed. Finally I found out there were none.  </p>  <p>This was in 2001. Has the situation changed in the past ten years?</p> 
26032	Going between Canada and America with the visa waiver program	<p>We are on our Honeymoon for 6 months.  We spent two months in South America and then came to the states.  Our 90 days is nearly up and after it is;  we are planning on spending the last three weeks of our honeymoon in Vancouver Canada.</p>  <p>The problem is that our flights home go back through America.</p>  <p>So we have spent 90 days in the states under the Visa Waiver Program. Then three weeks in Canada; and we will have to come back through America to get home. Our problem is that America seems to count going to Canada as part of the 90 days:</p>  <p>From the CBP website:</p>  <p>When traveling to the U.S. with the approved ESTA, you may only stay for up to 90 days at a time - and there should be a reasonable amount of time between visits so that the CBP Officer does not think you are trying to live here. There is no set requirement for how long you must wait between visits.</p>  <p>We only want to come back to the States for 1 day in transit to get our flight home but are worried that the border patrol won't let us back in because we have only been to Canada and not back to our country of residence. </p>  <p>Do you think this is a possibility?  Will they let us back in if it is just to fly home?</p>  <p>We have tried to change our flights to avoid coming back through the States but have been unable to do so.</p> 
27389	Sufficient Identification for Intra Schengen flights	<p>If one takes a direct flight from one Schengen member state to another, what's the minimum sufficient ID that needs to be provided to board the flight?</p> 
25745	Do I need to carry my passport while travelling within the Schengen area?	<p>If I have already entered the Schengen area, when am I required by law to carry my passport?</p>  <p>Basically do I need it when I</p>  <ul> <li>Travel within the same city</li> <li>Change cities</li> <li>Board a flight or a train</li> <li>Cross borders</li> </ul>  <p>When I was in Europe I had two completely different incidents with me and I wonder which was legal and which strictly was not?</p>  <ol> <li><p>I was asked for my passport on the Metz, France train station while leaving for Luxembourg. Note: This was <strong>NOT ON</strong> the train but simply on the station because I was clearly a foreigner.</p></li> <li><p>I was able to travel to Italy from Metz without my passport when I had accidentally forgotten it and had already boarded the train towards Italy. I was also able to come back and my passport was never asked for. I was traveling on a <em>EuRail Pass</em>.</p></li> </ol> 
17386	Can you still buy used panties in vending machines as a souvenir from Japan?	<p>In 1999 I came across a vending machine of used panties while hiking through Japan. Apparently it was made illegal in 1993, but still in 1999 they seem to be wide spread. Is this still the case, or are these vending machines no longer part of Japanese civilization. </p>  <p>Seems like an ultimate photo souvenir and I still regret not making a picture as proof for my strange experiences in Japan. People just don't believe this story.</p> 
6609	Schengen visa requirements and "validation"	<p>As an Indian citizen there are a bunch of requirements to get a Schengen visa. Some of them are: A reserved ticket (please do correct me if I am wrong) and confirmed hotel reservations.</p>  <p>Now, if I don't need reserved tickets but just an itinerary, do I really have to make the trip as soon as I get the visa or can I just do that any other time before the visa expires?</p>  <p>Is there a rule that says that "if you don't make your Schengen zone trip as soon as you get your visa, it would expire"?</p> 
26459	Applying for a Schengen visa in another country than my main destination	<p>I'm travelling to Belgium for 3 days in the summer, but my first point of entry would be Germany and the closest embassy I have is the German embassy.</p>  <p>Will the German embassy issue a Schengen visa? Because I wouldn't actually be staying in Germany.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p>

16734	Safety [petty crimes, mostly] in Japan	<p>I'm fully aware of the fact that Japan is considered a quite safe country in regards of petty crimes. However, I recently stumbled upon alerts about the Roppongi area where [quoting from wikitravel] </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Some clip joints send foreign female confederates into other bars to pick up clueless-looking targets, and an increasing number of them will spike your drink and then ravage your credit card while you're out cold</p> </blockquote>  <p>Are there any other threats I should be aware of? Is that alert really only limited to Roppongi area in Tokyo?</p>  <p>[I travelled quite a bit alone so I think I know the basics of safe travelling but I still like to analyze the possible threats I could face in a particular country in order to be able to avoid them]</p>

13542	What documentation do I need to file a police report for stolen company-owned equipment while traveling abroad?	<p>Monday evening, my vehicle was broken into while staying in Leon, Mexico, visiting from the U.S., and my laptop stolen, along with a few other personal items.</p>  <p>I went with a friend to the police station to report the incident, and was told that because the laptop was company-owned, a "factura" (special official Mexican invoice) was necessary to file a police report.</p>  <p>Clearly, I do not have such paper work, as neither I nor my company are from Mexico, so we don't have such requirements.</p>  <p>The clerk at the police station was very uncertian what documentation was necessary or would suffice in my situation.</p>  <p>In the future, what documentation (receipts/invoices, letter from employer, etc) should I carry with me, in the event that company-owned equipment is stolen while traveling, so that I can effectively file a police report for an insurance claim, etc?</p>  <p>While this incident happened in Mexico, I am interested in general advice for traveling with company-owned equipment in foreign countries.</p> 
448	Are there cheap GPS or other navigator devices with downloadable maps for the whole world?	<p>I don't need a recommendation or a list but my knowledge of GPS and "navi"s and the differences between them is an utter mystery to me.</p>  <p>But often I'm lost in backstreets in random countries where access to something like a live Google Maps would be awesome. I absolutely cannot afford a smartphone with worldwide roaming though.</p>  <p>Can GPS's do what I want or am I barking up the wrong tree? If they can is it only high end ones than can?</p> 
26504	GPS app for travelling in France	<p>I plan to travel to France this summer and rent a car for my convenience. The trip might last 12 days. However, I don't want to buy a GPS with France map nor rent a GPS because this cost too much and I may never use it again afterwards. </p>  <p>I have a Garmin GPS only with US maps, I am not sure if I can install the France map with a cost less than $10. Hence, I was wondering if I can download a GPS map for my android smartphone? If possible, where/which app should I download?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
12762	Do I need an airport transit visa for Germany if I have a Schengen visa?	<p>I am an Indian citizen living in the US. I am going back to India to get a H1B visa stamped. I have established that I would require an airport transit visa when I have a stopover in Germany.</p>  <p>On the way to India, I plan to visit a friend in Italy for a couple of days. For this, I will be applying for a Schengen tourist visa. My itinerary stops in Frankfurt both on the way to Milan and while heading to India from Milan. </p>  <p>Would I still require an airport transit visa despite having a Schengen visa?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
22864	Have I invalidated my own ESTA and if I fly to Mexico does that mean I will not be allowed back into the States?	<p>The ESTA that I entered the States on back in October was due to expire on January 8th. As I wished to stay a little longer (an extra couple of weeks) I searched the internet to see how this was possible. </p>  <p>On another forum I read that you could create a new ESTA, resetting the 90 days, by just filling in a new ESTA form and paying another $14, over-riding the dates already in place. I did this at the beginning of December, thinking it would give me until the end of February to leave the country. I now see that this was not intended for use as an extension and that it is instead intended for people who have not yet entered the country and wish to change their dates.</p>  <p>If I now attempt to 'retrieve' my ESTA online using the original application number it states that is has expired. I guess because I over-rode it with a new application. Am I now in breach and does this mean I will not be able to re-enter the country? </p>  <p>Also, I wanted to fly to Mexico, and then travel around Central and South America and then come back to America (maybe sometime in May or June) and fly home. I understand that Mexico is included in the visa waiver region - even though I will be travelling to other countries, will this also affect my ability to return to the country? Would it be better for me to fly to another country (I've heard Costa Rica is not included in the visa waiver region) and then travel to Mexico later - would this make a difference?</p>  <p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks Jo</p> 
8225	Is it possible to book an hotel being a minor?	<p>I've been in Morocco nearly a month, and it will soon be time for my return. During my stay here, checking into hotel rooms hasn't been an issue, but businesses aren't nearly as lenient about that sort of thing in America. I have a day layover in Newark, and I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for me to stay at one of the hotels nearby. I'm 17 years old, and my birthday is only 16 days after the time I'd need the room. Are exceptions ever made in situations like these?</p>

27842	Police ride along in London	<p>In a lot of US cities citizens can do police ride alongs.

22114	Boarding a train in India at another station	<p>I have booked a ticket on a train from Mumbai to Chennai and boarding at Pune. Since my schedules have changed, I will be in Mumbai on that day. Can I board the same train in Mumbai in my own ticket and claim the seat/berth?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa?

8373	Are there any techniques, tricks, or tactics to avoid a one-way fee when renting a car?	<p>Very often, when renting a car and dropping it off at a different location than where you picked it up, you have to pay a huge one-way fee.</p>  <p>Have you successfully used any technique, trick, or tactic to avoid paying such a one-way fee?</p> 
18644	Prepaid SIM card for data in UK, France, and Finland	<p>I want to buy a SIM card with prepaid data plan in UK. I will travel around France and Finland. I'm staying for less than a month, and I expect to use &lt;250 MB. It seems that most plans don't allow data roaming across countries for pre-paid plans. My criteria are (1) cost, (2) convenience, and (3) internet speed.

7288	How to get to and from the Vilnius airport to old town in the early morning	<p>I need to get from the airport to the old town after midnight on a Saturday morning. And then back to the airport for an 0610 flight on a Wednesday morning. </p>  <p>I'm primarily interested in the most efficient (quickest and least hassle) methods. Cheapness is a bonus. </p> 
911	What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?	<p>I've travelled a lot.  Living in New Zealand or the UK means anywhere is likely a flight, but I've always flown economy.  Twice between LA and Auckland I managed to get the exit row after talking nicely to the check-in girl, but apart from that, nothing.  I've spoken to ticket agents, tried 'check in chicken' (where you wait until the last minute before checking in, hoping there's an overbooking of economy) but have never managed to get an upgrade, while others I know seemingly get them quite often.  What strategy have you used or do you suggest to achieve this?</p>  <p>My next flight is from Melbourne to Tokyo, and I plan on trying all of these ;)</p>  <p>(Related questions on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17183/101">car hire</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17026/101">hotel</a> upgrades)</p> 
1083	What is the best method of purchasing a ticket with an open return date?	<p>I’ve been doing some research on traveling to South America and staying for an extended period of time (working vacation). The usual sources for flight info (Kayak, Expedia, Hipmunk) don’t have any info on flights with open return dates.  The other option would be to just buy a one-way ticket, then buy a return flight when I want to leave, but I’ve heard that international flights from South America are quite expensive.  What would be the most cost-effective solution?</p> 
27151	How does the SNCF Voyageur program work?	<p>I'm planning some TGV trips soon, but despite being a member of two different Railteam frequent traveller programs already, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9662/can-i-credit-travel-on-one-railteam-member-to-the-frequent-traveller-program-of">from this question</a> it doesn't look like I'd be able to credit the journeys on a TGV to either of them.</p>  <p>I think, if I want to get any credit for them, I'll need to join the <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">SNCF Voyageur Program</a>. The <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">English language website for it</a> has some broad details about the program, but doesn't really explain much about how you earn credit from TGV journeys, nor about redeeming them. It links through to various French language websites, but these all seem to have even less information on them, with all the important details apparently only available after you log in. (Since joining seems to take about a week, you can't just sign up and immediately see the details, grr....)</p>  <p>If someone with better google-fu than me, or someone who's a member who can log in to the site to get the full details, is able to post about the program that would be great. Specifically, I'm interested in:</p>  <ul> <li>What tickets I can and can't get credit for</li> <li>What's the earnings rate (per segment, per mile, per euro, something else?)</li> <li>How do the different levels work?</li> <li>How do the rewards work?</li> </ul>  <p>Hopefully from that, I can work out if there's actually any point in me joining the program for just a few trips or not!</p> 
27524	Specifying a Eurostar or SNCF frequent traveller number when booking through Loco2?	<p>Following the help <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/25491/26">given in this Travel.SE answer</a>, I now know the trick for specifying my Eurostar or SNCF frequent traveller number when booking a ticket through the SNCB website. Now, I find myself with the same problem with <a href="http://loco2.com/" rel="nofollow">Loco2</a></p>  <p>The Loco2 homepage is very good at asking you about any railcards you might have, and offering discounts on them, so it's good in that regard:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CNA0T.png" alt="Loco2 railcards"></p>  <p>Despite that, I can't seem to spot anywhere during the train selection or booking process where I can add a Eurostar Frequent Traveller or <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/27151/how-does-the-sncf-voyageur-program-work">SNCF Voyager</a> number. Is it possible to do so, and if so, what's the trick?</p> 
1340	Where is wild camping possible in Europe?	<p>Are there countries in Europe where wild camping with a tent allowed or at least tolerated? How high is the probability that someone will get angry at you or even call the police? </p>  <p>Please consider only cases where the travellers would be using common sense - not making noise, leaving no trace behind, staying out of sight of roads and houses, etc. In our case, the tent is small and easy to hide (dark green) and we won't need a camp fire.</p> 
26459	Applying for a Schengen visa in another country than my main destination	<p>I'm travelling to Belgium for 3 days in the summer, but my first point of entry would be Germany and the closest embassy I have is the German embassy.</p>  <p>Will the German embassy issue a Schengen visa? Because I wouldn't actually be staying in Germany.</p> 
5497	What are some tricks you use to buy cheap airline tickets in Europe?	<p>I have been flying with Wizzair, Ryanair and Easyjet for some time already and have found that there is really a lot to be learned about how to achieve the lowest prices. It was not uncommon for me to buy Ryanair tickets for €20 Euros and come next day to find out that they are for €10. Or to fly home on the 23rd of December for €50 with Wizzair even though the starting price was €100 for all flights around Christmas.</p>  <p>Some of my strategies include buying in the middle of the week and having a diversified set of credit cards to avoid currency-exchange/booking charges (e.g. Mastercard Prepaid for Ryanair). What tricks do you use?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
21198	Can I apply for a Schengen visa of the first port of entry or does it need to be the country of the longest duration?	<p>I'm planning to travel to the Netherlands, Spain and Bulgaria. My longest stay will probably be in Bulgaria. Now, Bulgaria doesn't issue a Schengen visa but allows people with a Schengen visa to visit. Which visa should I be applying for? Bulgarian Visa AND Schengen visa or just the Schengen visa for Netherlands or Spain?</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
6609	Schengen visa requirements and "validation"	<p>As an Indian citizen there are a bunch of requirements to get a Schengen visa. Some of them are: A reserved ticket (please do correct me if I am wrong) and confirmed hotel reservations.</p>  <p>Now, if I don't need reserved tickets but just an itinerary, do I really have to make the trip as soon as I get the visa or can I just do that any other time before the visa expires?</p>  <p>Is there a rule that says that "if you don't make your Schengen zone trip as soon as you get your visa, it would expire"?</p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p> 
14834	UK Transit Visa from USA to India	<p>I'm traveling to India from the US for my H1 stamping. I'm planning to go via the UK (LHR). I'm changing my visa status from F1 (visa expires in 2015) to H1. Is my visa valid to qualify for a transit visa exemption or should I get a air side transit visa? </p> 
543	Is it possible to get from the Philippines to Taiwan to Japan (or the reverse) without flying?	<p>It's not that I have a fear of flying but it seems the best way to see Island countries is by island hopping and these three countries are all relatively close to one another if you take into account their most outlying inhabited islands.</p>  <p>I know there used to be a ferry between Taiwan and Japan that went out of business in 2008. And there seems to be no ferry between the Philippines and Taiwan either.</p>  <p><strong>So how would a true adventurer do it? Can you pay fishing boats or the boats that presumably carry goods between these countries?</strong></p>  <p>I should make it clear that I don't expect to be able to do it on one single boat. One from Philippines to Taiwan and another from Taiwan to Japan would also be good. (More changes would also be good.) I've also included the reverse journey in the question as I'd consider either way to be a great adventure.</p>  <p>Also at which points can I legally enter each country for customs and immigration purposes?</p>  <p>And would it be a lot more difficult to find a boat starting in Japan which I assume to be a much more strictly controlled country?</p>  <p>(Please don't answer "just fly it's easier", such answers will be off topic.)</p> 
7695	Layover at Tokyo Narita airport: can I travel outside, and what kind of visa would I need?	<p>I am traveling from Singapore to San Francisco and an airline which I am choosing has a layover of 7.5 hours at Tokyo Airport (NRT). I am wondering if I would be allowed to go out to experience the city for a while in some form a visitor visa.  I know, Singapore has such facilities, but does anyone know if I can do something similar in Tokyo? Any suggestions or pointers are welcome. Note - I do not have a visa for Japan yet, but I am hoping that 1 day visitor visa could be possible at airport.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
17767	How to change a Schengen Visa valid for only 20 days?	<p>I applied for Schengen Visa at Italian Consulate in New York. It was given valid for only 20 days. I asked for 2 entries 10 days in 2 different countries while the 2 entries are 30 days apart as I leave for India in between. They gave 2 entries and 10 days stay. But they probably did not see my tickets and the visa expires before my second entry, which is into Italy. There is no phone to contact and you can only contact them via email, which I am waiting for 3 days now.</p> 
18140	Do I need a UK airside transit visa, if I already have a UK visitor visa?	<p>I am an Indian citizen and I do not qualify for DATV concession. Going for a trip to UK and Europe, I am having Multiple entry valid Visitor visa for UK. While on my way back from Paris I will be transiting in Heathrow airport. Do I need to take a airside transit visa even though I have a multiple entry valid UK visitor visa?</p>

25690	Sleeping/Narcotic Gas Alarm	<p>I intend to travel through rougher foreign parts on the cheap. To protect me from being robbed or raped I am going to buy a gas alarm. What do I need to know when buying one? What gases should it detect and at what thresholds? Why do only independent online stores from Europe sell them? Should I get an LPG gas detector too? Do models that run on small battery power exist?</p>  <p>Edit; I am not asking whether I should be worried. Please provide help on shopping for the alarm. </p> 
2069	Which route did the old Tbilisi-Rostov train route take and is it closed only for political reasons?	<p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2067/is-it-possible-to-get-a-train-from-georgia-to-moscow/2068#2068">This answer to the question about Tbilisi to Moscow</a> mentions a train route that is currently not running between Tbilisi and Rostov.</p>  <p>Where did this route cross the Georgia border and what other cities did it pass through on the way?</p>  <p>Is it closed just because of the current political situation between Georgia and Russia or has it been out of service for a long time and now partly removed etc as are some of the tracks that once connected Yerevan in Armenia?</p>

23788	Do I have to go through customs, recheck my bag, etc. during my Heathrow layover?	<p>I am flying from New York to Nairobi, Kenya, with a layover at Heathrow.</p>  <p>Both flights are on the same itinerary with British Airways (i.e. it was booked as a flight from New York to Nairobi).  They are both in terminal 5 at Heathrow.  I'm a US citizen, if that's relevant.</p>  <p>What exactly will I have to do during my layover in the UK?  Specifically, will I have to:</p>  <ul> <li>go through customs?  immigration?</li> <li>claim checked bags and recheck them?</li> <li>go through security again?</li> <li>anything else?  for example, I have heard something about having to go to a "flight connections" counter after I land in London and I'm not allowed to get on the 2nd flight without checking in here</li> </ul>  <p>I'm seeing a lot of conflicting information, and am trying to decide if I should pay $84 to pre-select seats at the front of the cabin to get out of the plane quicker/get to the front of any lines.

17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p> 
1014	How can I avoid or minimize jet lag?	<p>From my personal anecdotal experience, I've found it worse when travelling east around the globe.  I also tend to stay awake most if not all of the flight, so sleeping time doesn't tend to matter as the flights from London to NZ are minimum 28 hours.  Shorter flights you can arrange around daylight hours to reduce this, but otherwise, there must be better strategies to help out with.</p>  <p>UPDATE:</p>  <p>So I was fine despite nearly 48 hours of non-sleep from Mongolia to London, up the next 3 days at 8am to do stuff. However, the <em>second</em> week has been awful, sleepless nights and erratic sleepiness. Any theories?</p>  <p><strong><em>Also see: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2841/how-do-you-prepare-for-long-haul-flights/">How do you prepare for long haul flights?</a></em></strong></p>

17767	How to change a Schengen Visa valid for only 20 days?	<p>I applied for Schengen Visa at Italian Consulate in New York. It was given valid for only 20 days. I asked for 2 entries 10 days in 2 different countries while the 2 entries are 30 days apart as I leave for India in between. They gave 2 entries and 10 days stay. But they probably did not see my tickets and the visa expires before my second entry, which is into Italy. There is no phone to contact and you can only contact them via email, which I am waiting for 3 days now.</p> 
17855	Schengen visa holder issued by the Italian embassy - getting into Romania via Frankfurt?	<p>I'm planning to go to England, Romania and Italy in June.</p>  <p>I have applied for the English and the Italian visa and both were approved, But when I went to the Romanian embassy in Dubai, I was told that I don't need a visa to enter Romania because I hold a multiple entry Schengen visa and that will allow me to enter Romania for 4 days. </p>  <p>Now I have booked my tickets - Dubai - England, England - Romania via Frankfurt, Romania England via Frankfurt and then England - Italy. </p>  <p>My question is would I be fine traveling to Romania via Frankfurt, considering that I got my Schengen visa from the Italian embassy and that is not my first destination and I do not hold the Romanian visa? </p>

30178	Where can I eat dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?	<p>... apart from western countries like the Australia or the USA themselves.</p>  <p>During my visit to Taiwan, I wasn't able to find the dishes I'd typically encounter in a Chinese restaurant in Australia or the United States, such as sweet and sour pork, honey chicken, Mongolian lamb/beef, and fried ice cream.</p>  <p>I have two main theories on why this is. One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_ice_cream">fried ice cream</a>, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.</p>  <p>The other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.</p>  <p>The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant">Chinese restaurant</a> mentions:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese   emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian   Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,   specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,   beginning in the 1980s.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the "Chinese restaurant" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.</p>  <p>Where, if anywhere, can I find the dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants? Also, how should I identify the right kind of eatery in those countries?</p>

I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p>

27233	My flight was just canceled two weeks before the date	<p>Expedia just informed me that my flight with Ukrainian International Airlines was canceled. I'm flying from NYC to Kiev. This is an important business trip and I ordered tickets 2 months ago.  Expedia is offering me options 2 days before and 2 days after, but neither are good for me. The issue is not so much cost (though it is a pain), but more so the schedule. I really would prefer to leave on my selected date. </p>  <p>They are also offering a full refund, but I would end up losing a lot of money because I need to buy to tickets just 2 weeks in advance. </p>  <p>What are my options? Are airlines really allowed to just cancel on my reservation at a whim just 2 weeks in advance? I really feel screwed over here. Are there any rules or regulations that can help me? </p> 
27758	Where can I take a shower at Dubai Airport?	<p>I've got two transfers between long-haul flights coming up at DXB, and I'd like to freshen up with a shower.  Information on the net is outdated and contradictory, and the <a href="http://www.dubaiairport.com/en/Pages/home.aspx">official site</a> is remarkably useless.  What are my options?  Terminal 3 (Emirates) preferred, although I'll do the long schlep to T1 and back if need be.  No frequent flyer lounge access.</p>

I called up German Embassy in San Jose and they said that you require a Airport Transit Visa but seeing in various forums and online on German embassy's website I see that though transit is required for Indian Citizens but an exception is there if you have a valid U.S. visa. I am not sure what type of U.S. Visa are they talking about here. Does my B1/B2 visa hold as an exception for transit in that rule?</p>  <p>I am not sure if I need to get the transit visas or not and feel that embassy guys just didn't listen to me properly before giving me a verdict of getting a Transit Visa.</p> 
18265	Do I need a transit visa for Denmark in addition to my single entry Schengen area visa?	<p>I am a Chinese national holding a US greencard. I am planning on traveling to the UK and the Schengen area to visit France, Germany, and possibly some countries in between. I am applying for a UK visa and a single entry Schengen visa now. On my journey to the UK I am stopping in Copenhagen for a day. Do I need a transit visa for that? Should I apply for a multiple entry Schengen visa, or is that too much? My guess is a transit visa for Denmark and a separate single entry visa would be easier to apply for.</p>

30204	Entering the US with US citizenship pending	<p>Just looking for a little advice about a passport application and travelling. I currently live in the UK, and I am a British citizen. Since my father is an American citizen, I have claim to US citizenship, and recently applied for my first US passport. This would make me a dual national if my application is accepted and processed; however, the status of my application has not yet been confirmed, so I am still only a British citizen. I'm yet to know if I've even been accepted for citizenship.</p>  <p>I was planning on travelling to Los Angeles for a vacation next month, and as I'm yet to hear back from the US embassy, I was planning to travel on my UK passport like I normally do, although I have been told there might be problems with immigration when I try to enter the US, as I have a pending US passport application that could mean I gain US citizenship in the near future. Does anyone have any experience with this or know if I will be fine travelling on my UK passport? I assumed it would be okay since I'm not yet a dual national, but I've read different things. I'm not sure if it would show up on the system that I've applied for a US passport when they scan my British passport.</p> 
8456	How expensive is Belgium?	<p>Let me clarify a bit: how much should I expect to spend on food per day in Belgium if I am eating out nearly every meal?  Does it vary by city?  If so, how does Brussels compare? How about the French speaking part of the country?</p>  <p>I have done some research on my own, and found that the cost of living is quite high, but this refers to renting an apartment, taxes, etc.  There was no mention of the price of restaurants or local food as it compares to, say, a large US city (not NYC), which is my reference point.</p> 
8619	Travel agents - can they match ITA Travel Matrix prices?	<p><em>(applies to all travel agents, I'm just using FC as an example)</em></p>  <p>Flight Centre - the world wide travel agent, often boasts "lowest prices guaranteed".  I've had trouble getting them to actually hold to this in the past, but generally if you can prove you can get the price elsewhere, like a print out of say, AirNZ's website with a price, they'll match or beat it.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if they'd be willing or able to match <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/">ITA's Matrix site</a>?  It gives prices, but doesn't always indicate WHERE those prices are available.  If you took those prices and flight details along to a travel agent, like Flight Centre, are they able to find the flights for the same price, given all the flight details, assuming the flight is actually still available?</p> 
25019	Where to find ITA Matrix listed prices for MDE to CTG?	<p>On ITA Matrix I found a flight from Medellin to Cartagena for US$36 using Avianca's airline. But when I go to Avianca's website, it doesn't show this price (US$89).  I'm fairly certain it's updated, because just less than half a day ago, it was a different price. So how do I get this price? Also, skyscanner doesn't show this price for Avianca (same flight). I would do it through a travel agent, but after paying travel agent fees, I don't think it would be worth it.</p>  <p>Update: I contacted Avianca's call center and they charge a $25 service fee, which no longer makes it a good deal.</p>

20849	Schengen tourist visa refused. Can I appeal for reconsideration?	<p>My Schengen tourist visa was rejected by the German Consulate, Chennai stating that my date of flying from Chennai to Berlin (02-Nov-13) is not the same as the starting date of leave approval from my office (06-Nov-13).</p>  <p>But my company has sanctioned me leave considering the fact that 02-Nov-13 to 5-Nov-13 are office holidays.<br> I wouldn't blame the consulate because they wouldn't know that and they consider mismatching dates to be a discrepancy.</p>  <p>Now, what could I do?<br> Shall I appeal for a reconsideration without paying the visa fee again? If yes, how do I do that? And also, what is the probability that they would reconsider again?</p>  <p>Or, shall I reapply fresh again with a correction in my leave letter from the office?

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

The baby has a child travel document with a valid USA visa. </p>  <p>Question: Does my wife need to have any additional documents for the baby so she can travel without the father? In Ukraine we would need a written agreement from the father to allow my wife to fly with the baby, but what about in the USA? </p>

30325	Airport security: what if I carry an item with traces of explosive?	<p>One day I was travelling from UK to Switzerland, the security officer at Gatwick airport check (with a kind of swab) all my electronic devices (mainly phone and camera chargers + cables) to see if it was in contact with any explosive materials.</p>  <p>Now I just remember that today I use a ring from a hand grenade to keep my home keys. </p>  <p>The ring is just the outside part which hold the pin and come from an exercise hand grenade but with the real explosive inside.</p>  <p>Just to mention this is not dangerous at all, it is just a metal part, which was one day on an exercise hand grenade.  I just have it from my compulsory military service and it is not forbidden material.</p>  <p>My question is: is there any probability to detect some explosive (even it should not have been in contact) at the airport if they try to check my keys and what could be the consequences? Do you advise me not to travel with such a thing?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
19432	Overstaying on a US Visa Waiver Program	<p>A friend of mine came from Australia on the WVP and stayed 92 days.

She had no customs forms to fill out upon departure. </p>  <p>Question #2) How does this effect another WVP being issued if applied for?</p>

19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
27874	UK child visitor visa for Scotland	<p>I have a ten-year UK Child Visitor visa, and I'm an Indian citizen.

17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p> 
25225	Traveling to Germany before using a type D visa for Belgium	<p>I have a valid Belgium work permit and visa type D, however due to project delays, my travel to Belgium is delayed for few more months, so that visa is not utilized. However I would like to travel to Germany even before this travel.</p>  <p>Can I apply for a separate Schengen tourist visa for Germany in that case and travel? Will the immigration entry will be smooth for me? Or do I need to cancel the existing Belgium visa to secure a new tourist visa for Germany?</p>

10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

30381	During a SNCF strike, how can I check what trains will run without going to the station?	<p>It seems there's currently a national SNCF strike on at the moment, and I'm trying to work out if it'll affect my journey later.</p>  <p>The people I booked my TGV tickets with advised me to check <a href="http://www.infolignes.com">infolignes.com</a> for details of what's running and what isn't. When I go there, and pick my region, all I get is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TRAFIC TGV :</p>      <p>1 TGV sur 2 en moyenne.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If my train is one of the half running, then I can just turn up to the station and board as normal, all good! However, if it has been cancelled, I need to get to the station a long time in advance to get my ticket changed onto the previous service.</p>  <p>Without heading all the way to the station, is there any way to see which TGV services are actually running during a strike, and which ones aren't? </p> 
25578	Carrying semi-solid food in flights?	<p>My father is a Vegetarian and a frequent traveler.</p>  <p>Due to this it sometimes becomes difficult for him to get a well-balanced diet on flights and airports. Since he travels quite often, he eats anything vegetarian he can find but prefers home cooked food.</p>  <p>As an Indian, home cooked food can sometimes contain curry in the form of Pulses or Lentils or something (adequate source of protein). He prefers this kind of food while waiting on airports during the layover.</p>  <p>Currently he only carries Apples or some other fruit to help him during the flight. Is it possible for him to carry something additional to that in his carry-on as well?</p>  <p>For instance, Curry or other semi-solid food, Egg (he eats egg due to health constraints) or Boiled bottle gourd or anything Semi-solid along with some small quantity of juice.</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
27386	Transit Visa Requirement - Montreal to Tehran via London and Frankfurt	<p>I am planing a trip from Montreal to Tehran.

What if you explain that you aren't one of (Nationality X) that's caused trouble lately?</p>  <p>In places where a significant proportion of establishments discriminate against foreigners, are the places that don't discriminate fairly inferior to those that do discriminate?</p> 
9747	Baggage allowance of separate domestic flights with a connecting international flight?	<p>In the US, is there such a rule so that, if you are taking a domestic flight and then taking an international flight, the luggage allowance of the international flight will apply?

16040	Are laws about sex outside marriage less rigorously enforced in Dubai for people on layovers?	<p>Last night, I read on the news that Qantas was switching its main hub from Singapore to Dubai.</p>  <p>Smart Traveller <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/United_Arab_Emirates">notes</a> about the United Arab Emirates:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Homosexual acts and sex outside of marriage: Homosexual acts and all   kinds of sex outside of marriage are illegal and may lead to severe   punishment, including imprisonment and fines. Foreigners have been   imprisoned for having sex with people to whom they are not legally   married. De facto relationships and civil unions are not recognised in   the UAE and any sexual acts within these relationships are considered   to be sex outside of marriage. It is also against the law in the UAE   to live together or share the same hotel room with someone of the   opposite sex to whom you are not married or closely related. If   checking into a hotel as a couple, you may be asked by management to   prove that you are legally married. These laws apply equally to UAE   residents as well as visitors.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Should I assume that when Smart Traveller says that the laws apply equally to visitors, that includes even people who are just on layovers? Or are the laws less rigorously enforced for people on layovers?</p>  <p><strong>Background:</strong> I'm not planning on engaging in homosexuality, adultery or fornication in Dubai, but I'd rather not financially support airline routes that would expose fellow passengers to the risk of jail.</p>

Sadly though, the only alternative involved a very hefty delay and an unexpected night in Paris...</p>  <p>Normally, one would be able to reclaim 75% of the cost of the ticket for a delay of 3 hours or more, under the <a href="http://www.voyages-sncf.com/guide/ponctualite" rel="nofollow">SNCF Garantie Ponctualité</a>. This would go some way towards the hotel costs, even if not really covering the inconvenience...</p>  <p>However, I'm not sure if that still applies if the cancellation was due to a strike. Are you able to claim under the <a href="http://www.voyages-sncf.com/guide/ponctualite" rel="nofollow">SNCF Garantie Ponctualité</a> for delays caused by cancellations during a strike, or is that excluded?</p>

However, I wish to visit a friend in Croatia and stay there for 7 more days after Belgium; where Croatia will become part of the EU countries in 1/7.</p>  <p>My questions are: can I apply for Croatia as a non-EU country and expect a normal entry OR do I apply for a multiple entry visa from Germany since I will be landing there to go to Belgium even is I don't stay there. If I apply for Germany, can I simply go from Germany to Belgium, then Belgium to Croatia then back home or do I have to pass by Germany on my way back. How long does a visa from the Embassy take to be issued and do they keep the passport? Is it possible that I apply to Croatia from Belgium or not? Sorry for the long question.

It doesn't need to be a building, just be easy to get to, cheap or free, and publicly available.</p>  <p>So Grouse Mountain probably doesn't work, as it is currently covered in snow and costs to get up, and is far away, although I've been told the views are spectacular.</p>

So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
1628	Are there any problems crossing Kosovo's international borders or having their stamp in your passport?	<p>I'm thinking of heading from Romania to Serbia to Albania, possibly via Kosovo (on an Australian passport).</p>  <p>Since Kosovo becoming a country wasn't unanimously popular in the region I'm a bit concerned that Serbia or Albania might not fully approve of me visiting Kosovo. Are there any border crossing difficulties for tourists, or will having a Kosovo stamp in my passport cause issues when entering neighbouring countries? (Do all Kosovo's neighbours even recognize Kosovo?)</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
9924	Do I need a transit visa in Heathrow as a Bolivian Citizen?	<p>I'm a bolivian citizen currently living in Bolivia until November 6th at which point I will join my family in Norway. The Norwegian visa application has been approved, I hold a Schengen visa (already stamped on my passport) to enter Norway and I am supposed to stop by the authorities having jurisdiction in Norway to get the permanent visa stamped on my passport upon arrival. </p>  <p>I will arrive to the UK via Heathrow and will be in transit for 2 hours before I board my flight to Oslo on the same day. </p>  <p>I also have a 10-year tourist visa to the US. Will I need a visa to pass through the UK? If so, which one?</p> 
6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa.

They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa.

Do we need three OYSTER CARDS or can we share on one card?</p> 
6543	Entry into US with unpaid medical bills and ticket for careless driving	<p>While on vacation in the US last year, my wife and I was in a traffic accident. My wife had to spend more than a week in hospital before we could fly home. Our insurance is covering everything, but we keep receiving more bills in the mail. We are forwarding the bills to our insurance company, who tells us that they are taking care of them, but they are probably not paying them immediately (I expect there are a lot of paperwork involved). We can see that some of the invoices have strange addresses on them and have taken a long time to reach us, so we are a bit worried that there might be others that haven't reached us yet.</p>  <p>Also, since the accident was partly my fault, I received a ticket for careless driving, which I have paid.</p>  <p>We are going back to the US in a few weeks on vacation. Can any of this give us problems in immigration or elsewhere? Is there anything we should do or special papers we should bring?</p>

I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa.

13524	Preventing sea sickness?	<p>I come from a land locked place (in Canada) where there are no oceans around and just lakes. Whenever I go on a boat in a lake in Canada, I never get seasick and I feel fine. Sometimes when I come to a place like Mexico and I go out on the ocean, I get sea sick easily while others feel fine. I was wondering if getting sea sick can be caused by not being used to being out on the ocean where the waters rougher? This might be a little off topic but does the ocean have seasons for when the waters are calmer and are there places in the ocean that are calmer then others (Is it better to go farther out? Are you better to stay off the oceans and instead go on a gulf/sea where possible?) </p>

Say, perhaps, a Lille tram or Metro most of the way, Transpole bus across the border (still on the same ticket), then a Belgian bus the last bit?</p>  <p>Note that I'm probably not after the closest to Kortrijk I can get on a Transpole ticket, rather the closest where there's onward public transport. Well, assuming I can't use a Transpole ticket the whole way that is!</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p>

More criteria:</p>  <ol> <li><p>No 100% untamed boondocks, bears and lethal animals, please.    </p></li> <li><p>I won't drive, so must rely on public transport and walking (over reasonable distances). </p></li> <li><p>I must be able to see and access the ocean or a large body of water from this region.</p></li> <li>I want to evade temples and all buildings related to religion. </li> </ol> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p>

2796	Long term travel without being wealthy - how is it possible?	<p>Some people are practically most of the time traveling, from country to country, for a very long periods and sometimes even years. </p>  <p>How could one be able to travel for a long period of time, over several countries around the world, without being wealthy?</p> 
30679	Use of unused Schengen visa to travel to Switzerland	<p>I am Indian national residing in UK and have been issued Schengen visa by Norway Embassy which is Type 'C', multiple entry and expires on 21st oct 2014.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have never used this visa to travel to any country in Europe.</p>  <p>My question is whether I use this Schengen visa issued by Norwegian Embassy to travel to Switzerland for a 10 day holiday?</p>  <p>My first port of entry will be Geneva airport.</p>  <p>Please let me know if I can use this visa and if I need to carry some additional documents to clear immigration control when I land in Switzerland.</p> 
14082	Is it possible to make a decent income from travelling the world?	<p>My dream is to be able to travel the world and have a new adventure every day. With the internet, every day I'm able to see this beautiful and unique world, but those are only photos. I want to experience those places and cultures.</p>  <p>There are some things, of course, I have to think about, and the one most important is <strong>income</strong>. How do I support myself while travelling the world? The first thing I think is <em>What are my talents?</em></p>  <p>I'm a software engineer and love everything about software and the open source world. I'm a hard gamer and love to play a variety of games. I have very little experience with video and photo editing (Photoshop and After Effects), but the little I had with that, I enjoyed it. <strong>How can I make a decent salary writing software while travelling the world?</strong></p>  <p>I've also thought about writing a blog about my day-to-day adventures, and maybe even making a Youtube channel with vlogs about my day-to-day adventures. If I were to do that, how successful do you think it would be? If it was, how well could that support me (or how much money do you think I can make)? I also thought about photography, and to take photos and to sell them online, if that's possible.</p>  <p>Of course, there are things that, as a normal citizen, I wouldn't have to pay like house payment (though I would be paying rent or for a hotel which may or may not be less), car payment (though I would rent cars when I needed to), home internet (I could use Wi-Fi at local shops if applicable), entertainment (most likely if I'm travelling the world, I will have less concern about what new movies or games are coming out), etc.</p>  <p>I make a pretty good salary and have GREAT benefits including health care, retirement, etc. For me, it would be hard to let go of those kind of things. Is it possible while travelling the world to get some sort of health care? I hate to sound negative, but what happens if I need surgery but can't afford it, could I not get health care? And how would I take care of my retirement? What happens when I'm old and decrepit and don't move around as well as now?</p>  <p>It's that time in my life where sitting behind a desk, 40 hours a week, 5 days a week just isn't cutting it. Has anybody here or anybody you know of attempted this? How successful were they?</p> 
14895	Where can I get insurance for travel in late pregnancy?	<p>My wife and I need to travel to the United States, but she will be 30 weeks pregnant by the time the trip ends.  In addition to it being a very good idea in general, the US <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/882/~/visit-the-u.s.-while-pregnant-and-the-risks-involved">effectively requires travel insurance</a> if you're pregnant, but most travel insurance policies only offer cover until 26 weeks.  Where can we get a policy that covers her?</p> 
21155	Can growing a beard cause problems in crossing borders?	<p>I just recently renewed my passport with a picture taken just after I shaved. I haven't shaved since (>3 weeks) and I kind of like it. I am even looking into how to maintain a beard, but that is a question for another platform.</p>  <p>Regarding traveling I am a bit worried that I look a bit different now then when I renewed my passport. On all my other photo IDs I don't have a beard either. </p>  <p>Long story short, should I shave before boarding my next flight, or are Immigrations/Customs/Airline staff trained to look through the beard?</p> 
27446	Can I be refused entry due to my place of birth?	<p>Usually entry requirements are based on country of citizenship, but is it at all possible to be denied entry if you were born in a country in conflict with your travel destination ?</p>  <p>This is a specific question that I'm trying to make more general. In my case, I was born in Beirut but am Canadian citizen, always lived here. Not to get into details but technically speaking, Lebanon considers itself at war with Israel, and relations are always tense there. I would really like to visit Israel one day, but I'm wondering if I can be denied entry because my (Canadian) passport says I was born in Lebanon? </p>  <p>I was speaking with an Israeli-Canadian friend and he also thinks that he would never be allowed into Lebanon because he was born in Tel Aviv.</p>

13715	Re-enter USA from Canada with Visa Waiver Program	<p>My wife and I are doing a North America trip this summer.</p>  <p>We fly to NYC, stay a couple of days, then fly to Vancouver, spend two weeks in British Columbia and then back home (Germany).</p>  <p>We thought about travelling to Seattle a few days with our rental car, when we are in BC.</p>  <p>My question is, if there is any issue, when we reenter USA from Canada after leaving NYC a couple of days earlier? We both use Visa Waiver Program (German citizen).</p> 
31379	Why is the British passport the most valuable despite colonization?	<p>I was checking out Wikipedia and I could see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_British_citizens" rel="nofollow">British passport entitles to visa-free or visa-on-arrival for 173 countries</a> despite colonization by the British. While USA ranks 2nd with 172 countries. I am not sure if this is the right forum to ask, but can anyone explain me? (let me know if this is a question that belongs here before downvoting)</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
6946	Countries with no visa requirements on its visitors	<p>Recently I learnt that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra">Andorra</a> has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Andorra">no visa restrictions</a> to its visitors (citizens of any country) and free to enter if they hold a passport or EU national identity card. </p>  <p>Are there any other country(ies) which have similar no visa restrictions for its visitors irrespective of citizenship? </p>  <p>PS: Though Andorra has not restrictions, one need to have a Schengen visa with multiple entry as its a land-locked country and only be accessed via Spain or France.</p> 
31146	Can we carry three new smart phones in hand luggage to India?	<p>I bought two smart phones for my father and sister in Europe. Will the customs officer in India (Chennai) give any trouble if I carry two new unopened smart phones with the box in my hand luggage? Also, i'm a student, does this give me any advantage over it?</p> 
31219	Transiting in Dubai on back-to-back return tickets	<p>In December this year, I am planning to fly the Helsinki–Dubai–Mumbai route (and return). I am planning to stay in Dubai for few days on my way to Mumbai. If I book this as one ticket, I have to pay much more compared to booking two separate return tickets for Helsinki–Dubai and Dubai–Mumbai. I will have to book these with separate airlines (Finnair for Helsinki–Dubai and some other airline for Dubai–Mumbai).</p>  <p>I have two questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I am not sure about checking my luggage through on my way back. I won't have a Dubai visa on my way back, so I cannot go out of the transit area to retrieve my luggage and check it in again. Do you think the airline that operates the Mumbai–Dubai route will be able to check my luggage in all the way to Helsinki?</p></li> <li><p>Assuming that Mumbai-Dubai airline doesn't forward my luggage, I can get by with just carry-on luggage. But can there be a problem checking in at Mumbai if I don't have Dubai transit visa?</p></li> </ol> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
7943	Why is there a 'secret carrier' option for a flight?	<p>When searching for a flight on <a href="http://www.kayak.com/#/flights/MIA-HKG/2012-06-30-flexible-1day/2012-07-12-flexible-1day/business">kayak.com</a> (not for me, I don't fly business), it shows a "Secret Carrier" option.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RoIEK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>What gives? Why are they unable to tell us even the code-share partner? What if you want to use miles? How does the travel agent know who they're booking with?</p> 
21347	Why do hotel booking sites ask for the number of people? Does it matter how many I say?	<p>I was planning a stay at a hotel in Chicago for an overnight layover and checking prices on the hotel's booking site (in this case the Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport) for a room with 2 double beds. The site asks for the number of people in my party. In my case there will be 3 adults, no kids.</p>  <p>I experimented with different answers to the # of adults question and found that 1-2 people sharing a room gave a price of $94, for 3 people it was $118, and 4 people raised it to $142. </p>  <p>I don't get the extra charge since it will be the exact same room in all of those situations. Do most hotels do this? If I just book the room specifying 2 people and bring a 3rd is there any risk involved? </p>  <p>I'd also like to hear any insight from hotel insiders about what is behind the logic of charging different rates for the same room depending on how many people will be in it (assuming you don't need an extra roll-away bed). It would make sense if there was a free breakfast or something, but this hotel doesn't offer that.</p> 
31033	Transit in Heathrow with an Italian student visa	<p>I am an Indian citizen travelling from India to Italy on a student visa via the UK. My flight stops at Heathrow for 2.30 hours. Will I be required to have a transit visa?</p> 
6526	Do I need to get a visa for Turkey?	<p>I'm going to travel to Iran from Germany. Since I've booked connected flights (Germany- Turkey, Turkey- Iran), do I need a visa for Turkey as well as Iran?</p>  <p>This is my flights schedule: </p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li><p>Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg (check-in Swiss sector) to Istanbul - Sabiha   Gökçen</p>      <p>Dep 19 May 2012 22:30</p>      <p>Arr 20 May 2012 02:25</p></li>   <li><p>Istanbul - S.Gokcen(SAW)Tehran - IKA(IKA)</p>      <p>Departure: IST (SAW) 20.05.2012  23:05</p>      <p>Arrival:THR (IKA) 21.05.2012 03:25</p></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>So if I need a visa planning to leave the airport for a few hours to Istanbul until the next flight, I would stay at the airport. </p>  <p>Note: I have German nationality.</p> 
6383	What does "SSSS" on my boarding pass mean?	<p>When I checked in for my American Airlines flight from Costa Rica back to the States, I noticed that my boarding pass had "SSSS" printed across the top left corner.</p>  <p>Nobody else in my party had this on their boarding pass, and I didn't notice that I was treated differently at the airport (security, waiting at the gate, etc.), with one exception:</p>  <p>During the boarding process, I was pulled aside, and after my bag was searched, the agent swabbed my hands with some kind of cloth that she then fed into a scanner.  I seemed to be the only person in line who had to submit to this extra procedure.</p>  <p>What does "SSSS" mean?  Does it only apply at certain airports/jurisdictions?</p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p>

The worth of new laptop  (Lenovo Yoga Idea Pad 13) is about $1000 and old one (Macbook Pro) is > 1 lakh INR. I want to leave the new laptop in India. I have a copy of bill with me but not the original bill. I want to know if I have risk of being charged with custom duty.</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
1538	Flying UK to Canada via USA. Do I need to apply for ESTA?	<p>I'm going to fly from the UK to Canada via EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport). Do I need to apply for a Visa Waiver through the ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization)?</p> 
2720	Is it really forbidden to cross the Indian border with Indian rupee?	<p>Last week I tried to exchange some Swiss Francs into Indian rupees. For that I visited a big bank and they told me that they have rupees but I'm not allowed to import any into India. Is this really true?</p>  <p>And if so, what's the reason behind such a law?</p>  <p>P.S. The bank also told me that in practice it isn't a problem if you take money below 200 Swiss Francs into the country.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
21979	Is there an international standard for medical prescriptions, you can carry around and show to any pharmacy?	<p>I have a condition that only sometimes needs medication, most of the time not. My doctor gave me a set of prescriptions I can use when the condition surfaces. I only go to the pharmacy to fetch that medication if its needed or before I travel, so I have it on me when abroad. Mostly, I end up not using my medication and throwing it away after the valid until date surpasses.  I am just wondering that - like the international drivers license - there is an international prescription standard which can be accepted world wide, so that I don't need to bring the medication with me. </p> 
12765	Is 1½ hours enough for a transit at Munich airport?	<p>I'm heading to India next week and have a connection in Munich, Germany. I made the mistake of booking a flight with only an hour and a half layover (freaking out!) and I'm wondering if I'll have to go through customs in Munich or if I can pass right on through.</p> 
25531	Lufthansa connecting flight at Munich, only 45 minutes in between. Will I be able to make it?	<p>I bought a single ticket from Lufthansa, of Mumbai to Paris. My first flight (LH765) lands at 5:55am at Munich, from where I have another Lufthansa flight (LH2226) to Paris at 6:40am. This is a single ticket so I guess its responsibility of the airline to get me on the second flight, but since it's Non-Schengen to Schengen, will customs etc. be a problem? I am assuming the checked-in luggage would transferred automatically by the airline. Will I be able to make it?</p> 
27466	Travelling from Dresden to Delhi via Munich with 45 minutes transit time, is it sufficient?	<p>I am travelling from Dresden to Delhi via Munich (holding Indian passport with Schengen visa) through Lufthansa airlines. The transit time at Munich airport to board Delhi flight is just 45 minutes. Can I cover passport/security/customs check within 45 minutes?</p>  <p>If I am reaching Munich on exact time and due to all the customs and security checks, if I miss my connecting flight to Delhi, whether airlines will arrange the next available flight for me or we need to get it? </p> 
9245	UK citizen, US company, living in UK: Can I use an ESTA?	<p>So:</p>  <ul> <li>I am a UK citizen</li> <li>I work for a US company</li> <li>I currently live in the UK and have no US visa</li> </ul>  <p>What am I allowed to do when I enter the US on an ESTA? Am I allowed to work if I am getting paid in a UK bank account? Obviously a potentially contentious issue and I'm keen to get it right!</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
26261	Boarding point change for an Indian rail reservation	<p>I booked a train ticket on the Yeswantpur (Yeshvantapur, YPR) to Calicut (CLT). I gave my boarding point as Yesvantpur (YPR). My reservation is from Yeswantpur. Am I entitled to board at Karmelram (CRLM)?</p> 
7043	Do I have to enter the UK on my UK passport?	<p>I'm a British National (Overseas), which basically means that while I don't have the right of abode in the UK, I am permitted to visit the UK without a visa. However, my passport has expired, and while it's being renewed, the schedule is a bit tight.</p>  <p>At the same time, I'm an US Citizen, and since I'm only planning to visit the UK, I don't need a visa if I enter on my US passport.</p>  <p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p> 
31506	What documents do I need to do a visa run at Thailand/Myanmar border?	<p>I'm having a hard time figuring out what documents I need to provide when I show up at the Burmese border to do a Thai visa run.</p>  <p>According to <a href="http://www.mip.gov.mm/portfolio/the-required-terms-and-conditions-for-visa-on-arrival/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mip.gov.mm/portfolio/the-required-terms-and-conditions-for-visa-on-arrival/</a> there's a ton of requirements, but maybe only some of them will apply to me.</p>  <p>My plan is to hop up to Mae Sai, get my passport stamped and then re-enter Thailand (I have a double-entry tourist visa for Thailand, so I'm not worried about that part).</p>  <p>What documents do I need to satisfy entry requirements at the Burmese border?  Also, is there a fee that I will need to pay?  Can I pay the fee in Baht, or do I need to acquire Kyat/Dollars?</p>  <p>I am a US citizen, if that is important.</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
23090	UK tourist visa refused 3 times. Need to get there for flight home	<p>Around 3 years ago I applied for a temporary working visa for the UK, but it got rejected because I lied to the police once and had some old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence" rel="nofollow">DUI</a> charges. So I never went to the UK.</p>  <p>I recently arrived in Gatwick on a flight from Amsterdam while on my journey backpacking around Europe. I though surely for those offences a tourist visa would be OK, but no. After keeping me all night, they decided to send me back to Amsterdam. They told me the main reason was that I didn't have any documents with me concerning my transit out of the UK (all of it is on the internet).</p>  <p>When in Amsterdam I collected the massive pile of flight information which I had already booked weeks earlier – my flight home to Australia is from London. </p>  <p>Then I tried to catch the Eurostar from Belgium with the documents they'd asked for. The way I was treated was so disgusting that I still can't believe it. I was asked if I was a "Shanty" (whatever that is). When I told an officer that I'd planned to stay in Brixton to see my friend, he asked me, "Is he black?" When I said, "No – <em>she's</em> not," he said, "There's a lot of black people there." This may give you an idea into the kind of "people" I was dealing with. </p>  <p>After hours of intense questioning where he'd try to catch me out on any tiny little thing I said, and actively try to trick me, and say, "This stamp was wrong," or, "That stamp doesn't exist" and me having to grab the passport and show it to him, they said no, because now they thought I'd work illegally. They knew I wasn't going to, and they knew I knew. It was just about them winning and me doing as I was told. Even if they were wrong.</p>  <p>He told me there was nothing stopping me going to Dublin. So, with only a few days left on my Schengen visa, I did. And they, like every other country I've been to in my 4 years of backpacking, let me in. And today I flew to Glasgow, and soon I will take the train to London.</p>  <p>My problem is, I have a flight booked from London to Iceland, then a return flight to London, where I have 5 days before my flight back to Aus., and they will again probably stop me. My question is this: if I enter the UK from the EU and am rejected again, what will they do with me if my visa is not valid anymore for the country I arrived from? If they'll send me home, that's fine, and to be honest, I'd love to see the UK pay for that after all the money and stress they've caused me. My other question is – if I book a connecting flight to Dublin – will I still have to pass immigration? Or can I stay in the security area?</p> 
14074	What does it take to make my car fully compliant with all EU countries?	<p>In Belgium every car is required to carry at least one fire extinguisher. In Germany you need to have an <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5946/where-can-i-buy-the-german-environmental-badge-while-driving-to-my-destination-i">environment sticker</a> to drive into a city. In France you might need <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/12922/do-rental-cars-in-france-come-with-the-two-legally-required-breathalyzers">alcohol testers</a>. Coming from mainland Europe to the UK you are required to apply <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/981/whats-the-name-for-the-blocking-stickers-used-on-car-headlights">lamp stickers</a>. You need to have fluo vests in some countries. Sometime only the driver, some times all passengers. Today I learned that in Spain you are required to carry spare glasses. If you are wearing sun glasses, while driving you also need to have spare sun glasses.  I could ofcourse ask a question on each country which I intend to visit, but can I make my car fully EU compliant. Meaning I have everything required in if it is required in at least one EU member state. </p>  <p>What inventory should I have in my car? What tests, governmental stickers, or other regulation should I adhere too?</p>

18028	What happens if my ESTA expires on the day of arrival?	<p>I'm French and will travel the 14th of June to the US.

2720	Is it really forbidden to cross the Indian border with Indian rupee?	<p>Last week I tried to exchange some Swiss Francs into Indian rupees. For that I visited a big bank and they told me that they have rupees but I'm not allowed to import any into India. Is this really true?</p>  <p>And if so, what's the reason behind such a law?</p>  <p>P.S. The bank also told me that in practice it isn't a problem if you take money below 200 Swiss Francs into the country.</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
24659	Maximum cash allowed when travelling to the US	<p>I was wondering if someone knows the legal limit of cash money allowed per adult tourist when entering the US, especially from the UK.</p>  <p>The reason is that I would like to get the best conversion rate and buy some dollars (selling my GBP) at the UK cambios/exchange offices so that my bank fees and other charges can be avoided. Therefore, taking the legal limit of cash will help me to make the most out from the currency conversion mishapps.</p>  <p>Any idea on those numbers?</p> 
12771	I want to travel to the USA while working remotely for my non-US employer	<p>I would like to travel in the USA for a period of 3 - 6 months. But I want to spend some time working for my employer (remote work) and getting paid by the employer. Is this possible under a tourist visa (B1/B2)?</p>  <p>I hope this is OK since I will not be getting paid by a US employer. I am in the IT trade so all that I will be needing is my own laptop and a connection to the internet. The money I earn would actually help me pay for the expenses I get during the holiday.</p>

25578	Carrying semi-solid food in flights?	<p>My father is a Vegetarian and a frequent traveler.</p>  <p>Due to this it sometimes becomes difficult for him to get a well-balanced diet on flights and airports. Since he travels quite often, he eats anything vegetarian he can find but prefers home cooked food.</p>  <p>As an Indian, home cooked food can sometimes contain curry in the form of Pulses or Lentils or something (adequate source of protein). He prefers this kind of food while waiting on airports during the layover.</p>  <p>Currently he only carries Apples or some other fruit to help him during the flight. Is it possible for him to carry something additional to that in his carry-on as well?</p>  <p>For instance, Curry or other semi-solid food, Egg (he eats egg due to health constraints) or Boiled bottle gourd or anything Semi-solid along with some small quantity of juice.</p>

27834	Will it matter if I cross the Russian border 6 hours after my visa expires?	<p>I am visiting Moscow, Russia and leaving on a specific date in July, per my tourist visa. I'll be leaving via bus, going into Lithuania.</p>  <p>I just realized that the bus leaves at 10:30pm the day my visa expires and won't cross the Russian border into Lithuania until 6am on the 27th. So my visa will be expired before I even cross the border.</p>  <p>Should I change my bus tickets? Or will the 6-hour overage probably not be a big deal? I really don't want to get stuck in Russia.</p>

How do I coordinate the flights so that we are together on the return leg?	<p>In the next two months I will be flying overseas to the Philippines to pick up my fiancee. I will be booking a round trip ticket, and will need to find a way to book her a ticket on the same route back as my return leg… but I can't seem to figure out a good way to do this.</p>  <p>Would I be better off booking two round-trip tickets, and let her seat fly empty for the trip there? Is this something where I would be better off using a travel agent instead of trying to book online or direct?</p>

31026	Does a US immigration officer really have the power to deny entry to the country at personal will?	<p>Quite some comments exist that in the end it is the individual immigration officer that has the final call to let you enter the US or not and that there is no way of objecting that decision. </p>  <p>Given the major effects of such a decision - you have a denied entry on record, complicating future visits - I find it hard to believe that a single person has the power to bring such much havoc to others. I can't believe you get denied entry because the immigration officer might have some domestic issue.</p>  <p>So is it an urban myth, or does entering a country remain some sort of lottery?</p> 
11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p>

6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p>

26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident.

27672	Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don't want to stay in Greece at all?	<p>I want to travel to Spain however the requirements state that my UK residence permit be valid for 3 months after intended date of departure from the Schengen area. I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p> 
9685	What external batteries can I get to charge a tablet during long road trips?	<p>So there is an external battery <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002K8M9HC">available at on Amazon</a>.</p>  <p>I'm just wondering though - would this only provide around 8 hours of additional power for most tablets? Are there any options that provide more than 8 hours of additional power? I use a Lenovo ThinkPad tablet. </p>  <p>The cars do have lighters that you can plug electric devices into, but if the charging rates are slower than they are at home, then the tablet would take a very long time to charge (and since it is a group field trip, the lighter charge would have to be shared). </p>

26780	Is there a flight search engine that combines flights from different airlines?	<p>Is there a search engine that considers "mix&amp;match" flight combinations?</p>  <p>My current problem: I need to go from FRA to YLW (Frankfurt/Germany to Kelowna/Canada) on July 29th, and arrive no later than 5pm. The search engines I checked only offer €3000+ flights.</p>  <p>I found a 2-stop combo through LHR and YVR for half that price. I'll probably have to check my baggage out and back in twice, but if the layover times are long enough, who cares?</p>  <p>A <em>real</em> search engine could find that for me (or something that's even better). Or, hell, give me a place to bulk-download the flight schedules from and I'll program it myself (of course I'd also need a way to check seat availability …).</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Please read before answering. A search engine which does this should, at minimum, show the flight combination through LHR which I found manually. Note that I need to arrive before 5pm, <em>on the same day</em>.</p>  <p>Also note that this is a generic question; I'm not looking for a specific good flight here -- but the details are useful to illustrate whether an answer is actually valid. :-/</p>  <p>NB: Typo, should have been July 29th.</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p>

Something like <a href="http://www.orangeways.com">Orangeways</a>?</p>  <p>I've checked Deutsche Bahn cost for transport from Berlin to München and I was shocked with the price about 100 Euro. By Orangeways similar distance costs about 20 Euro... Is there any operator that allows to travel in Germany with so attractive prices?</p> 
11648	Is there a list of online public transportation planners?	<p>For Oslo in Norway you can go to <a href="http://ruter.no/en/">ruter.no</a>, punch in where you are and where you want to go. It then gives you options on how to get from point A to point B using various public transportation (and walking).</p>  <p>Is there a list of such services in other countries somewhere? In particular I'm curious to know if there is such a service for London, UK. </p> 
13490	What is the fastest way to get from Courmayeur/Aosta to Milan?	<p>We will be crossing the Italian/French border through Mont Blanc via cable cars, which we heard through Rick Steve's article: <a href="http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/destinations/france/chamonix.htm" rel="nofollow">From France to Italy over Mont Blanc</a>.  We will be starting off in Chamonix and arriving in Courmayeur. What's the fastest (and relatively cost-effective) way to get to Milan from Courmayeur? </p> 
21075	How long does my passport have to be valid for a layover in the US?	<p>On Wednesday I'll be flying from Amsterdam to Canada (Saskatoon), there is a layover in the US (Minneapolis) for two hours (and obviously I'm not going to leave the airport). I know that for Canada, my passport has to be only valid for the time I'm staying there, but I don't know how this works for layovers and if it's even valid there?! I'm German, my passport expires on November 12th and I'll be leaving Canada on November 3rd (but directly back to mainland Europe, no layover in the US), so my passport is valid for a bit more than a month at the time of my layover.</p>  <p>So, basically: Should I panic about not being able to board the plane or can I go to bed and sleep without fear?</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
19073	Prepaid SIM card for Austria, with mobile internet and relatively cheap foreign calls	<p>I'm planning to spend about a week in Austria.</p>  <p>I'd like to have mobile internet (mostly for geocaching). 100MB should be enough, however, it would be good to have a bit more. I'd like also to have the possibility to call foreign numbers with reasonable price (my travel friends).</p>  <p>Crucial factor: prepaid card should be ready to use just after purchase, so if internet registration is required, it would be rather no-go (the need to search for Internet Cafe etc.).</p>  <p>Does something like that exists? If not, what would be the nearest hit? </p>  <p>For example, in Germany there's Lebara, with mobile plan for 10 Euro, and very cheap foreign calls, but it requires internet registration. T-Mobile is registered by purchase and ready to go just seconds after, but it has extremely expensive foreign calls. If the situation is similar in Austria, in worst case I would have to choose one of available options, or buy both. </p> 
31146	Can we carry three new smart phones in hand luggage to India?	<p>I bought two smart phones for my father and sister in Europe. Will the customs officer in India (Chennai) give any trouble if I carry two new unopened smart phones with the box in my hand luggage? Also, i'm a student, does this give me any advantage over it?</p> 
301	Is it worth getting a one-week public transportation pass for Rome?	<p>My friend and I are first-time travelers who will be visiting Rome for a week in late September. According to <a href="http://www.rome.info/transportation/tickets/" rel="nofollow">Rome.info</a>, a week pass could be gotten for 16 Euros. Is it worth buying a week-pass? More specifically:</p>  <ul> <li>Are all the touristy (and some non-touristy) places within walkable distance?</li> <li>Can the public transit take us to anywhere that we would want to go in Rome?</li> <li>Does the public transit run frequently? Is it safe?</li> </ul> 
33864	Documents necessary (and recommended) for first time travel to EU for US Citizen	<p>My fiancée who is an American citizen is travelling to visit me in France. Since I am not an American citizen and am from South Asia, working in France, I have no experience in advising her or searching for "what documentation is necessary" for her to travel to Europe.</p>  <p>I only know from Wikipedia's entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens" rel="nofollow">visa requirements for US citizens</a>, <a href="http://france.visahq.com/" rel="nofollow">visaHQ's drop down menus</a> and one of the <a href="http://www.consulfrance-chicago.org/spip.php?article477#short-stay-visa-less-than-days-requirements" rel="nofollow">French consulate's website</a> that she is entitled to visa-free travel to France (among a bunch of other countries). I also find that she does <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11225/do-i-need-an-esta-for-austria-as-a-us-citizen?rq=1">not need ESTA</a>.</p>  <p>However, since I have always been subject to visa rules wherever I have travelled, I just wanted to be doubly sure that she was in the clear to travel to Europe/France with ONLY a US passport.</p>  <p>Does she need any other method of authorization or travel document or other <em>recommended documents</em>? What should she carry with her in form of documentation? She is planning on staying here for 3 weeks (~23 days) so I am sure she doesn't need <a href="http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?article401" rel="nofollow">a long stay visa</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Additional questions</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Would my fiancée need <strong>travel specific health insurance</strong> similar to it being required for South Asians travelling to Europe for tourism?</li> <li>What about a <strong>certificate of finances</strong>? She has minimal finances so would it be ok for me to provide her with my bank statement as I would be doing the "spending"?</li> </ul> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
10590	Lost passport with Schengen visa	<p>My passport was stolen in Prague on my way to Vienna. I filed a police report and our embassy swiftly acted by giving me a temporary passport for my onward journey to Munich and Rome. Upon exit from Rome, the immigration ask for the Schengen visa, when I told him that I lost my passport, he did not ask for any document to support my claim, he just stamped my new passport with exit. I am not sure if on record, I am officially out of the Schengen area or not. I am scared that without the lost visa, it appears that I am still in the area and might reach the 90 day limit and will be denied when I re-apply as it would appear I broke the rule. What to do?</p> 
21692	Travelling without a visa after passport was stolen	<p>I am a student on a short term Schengen visa in Belgium. Recently, my passport was stolen after which I got a new passport issued by the Indian embassy. This obviously does not have a Schengen visa (that was on the stolen passport). I have copies of all the stolen documents and the police report. With these, is it okay to travel within the Schengen countries? The visa expiry is still another month away, though I don't know if it is now rendered invalid for travel. Any suggestions?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
25196	Valid Schengen visa in unmarried name and old expired passport, can I travel with both again?	<p>I am a spouse of a British citizen and applied and was granted a Schengen visa from the French embassy last year, which is valid till 2015, this was however in my passport which has my maiden name. I have recently changed all my documents and passport to my married name including getting a new passport. When I got the new passport, my old one was made void by punching 2 holes through the bio data page.</p>  <p>My question is, I would like to go to Spain for a wedding next month, can I travel with both my passports or will I need to cancel the old visa in expired passport from French embassy and then apply for a new visa from the Spanish embassy?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
30522	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for Canada?	<p>I'm passing through Canada, on my way to somewhere else. I'm staying only a short time. </p>  <p>Is there a website, or some other way of find out out if I need a visa?</p> 
18898	Casual study in the USA	<p>I have a New Zealand passport. I am married to a Canadian and will apply for a Canadian Residency shortly.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <em>I've since discovered there is at least a one year delay to get a residency in Canada. So the added issue I face is that when I enter the USA, departing to Canada (as a non-resident there) will not fulfill the requirement that I leave the region of USA/Mexico/Canada within 90 days of entering the USA. Looks like I'll have to depart further afield, which is going to be a pain.</em></p>  <p>We wanted to engage in some informal studies in the USA. The studies are not at a college or institution. It is private studies, and requires us to be in the USA for a period of about 3 weeks four times a year. We can also, optionally, attend 9 day workshops at the end of every interim month.</p>  <p><strong>To clarify, we want to simply make multiple trips to the USA over a 1 year period, as tourists under the VWP. The fact we are studying is ultimately irrelevant, although pertinent to my questions because at the border I will be asked, "What is the purpose of your visit?".</strong></p>  <p>We'll be residing in Canada during the year in question. </p>  <p>So far I have found out that "casual studies" are permitted on a VWP. But I have not found an official definition. Some (non-Government) sites say that casual studies mean the course is under 18 hours per week. But I didn't find any reference to this on a Government site.</p>  <p>I wanted to ask if anyone knows more about this, or can refer to me an official US Gov site with the information I require?</p>  <p><strong>My question does not relate to long-term study (otherwise it would have an easy answer, and not require posting). It is about short-term trips to the USA, and understanding what the legal view is on these trips. Say for a week at the end of every month, over a year. And for three weeks every third or forth month. Is US Border control likely to have an issue with this? Are they likely to think I am coming to the USA to often? Would it be advisable to not disclose that I am "studying" with a teacher there, and to simply say I am visiting a friend (which is still technically true)?</strong></p>

2731	Where can I rent a car in French Guiana to cross to Suriname/Brazil?	<p>Flying to Suriname can be very expensive since the transatlantic connection is tightly controlled by the GOS. A less expensive solution is to travel to the neighboring French Guiana which is officially part of the EU. Traveling the 400 km between the two capitals can be quite a hassle. It would be convenient to rent a car and just drive yourself. </p>  <p>Unfortunately the main airport renting agency does not allow you to cross the border to Suriname or Brazil. Does anyone here know of a renting agency that allows EU-South American border crossing? </p>  <p>If there is really no renting agency, could you buy insurance for EU/South-American border crossing? </p>

33671	What will happen if I overstay in Thailand with an expired passport but get a new passport months later?	<p>I am currently living in the north of Thailand. </p>  <p>I have an inquiry about any latest updates about Thailand immigration and overstay: I would like to find out on certain issues on overstaying:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I have been overstaying for 9 months now (I entered Thailand in October 2013 with a tourist visa). My passport validity was 6 months at the time of entry and has expired in March 2014. I was able to get a new passport from my home country in July 2014. </p>  <p>This means I was in Thailand without a valid travel document in addition to not having a valid visa for almost 4 months, making it now 9 months of overstaying in Thailand.</p>  <p>I just got a job to teach English in a school, so I need to exit from Don Muang airport for a non-immigrant visa to Malaysia if possible and as soon as possible. </p>  <p>Is it still possible to pay the maximum fine of 20.000 baht for overstaying as recommended by immigration law at my exit at the Don Muang airport, or is there something else I may need to do before I can exit for a non-immigrant visa back to Thailand?</p></li> <li><p>In this situation, is it possible to pay for the overstay at the immigration counter at Don Muang international airport before exiting? I have to take an AirAsia flight for exiting.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Normally overstaying is not good, but due to some circumstances it had to happen in this way. </p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
34217	Train passport control from London to Paris	<p>I'm a non-EU citizen, I will be travelling from London to Paris next month, so I was wondering since most countries track entry and leave dates, if I use the train to switch these countries and they don't control it, my UK visa will seem like entry YES but no leaving. Same for the Schengen, I wouldn't have an entry date but I'll be leaving,</p>  <p>Will it be trouble later? Are they controlling this on trains? If not is there anything I should do before?</p>

16960	How to get from Heathrow Airport to King's Cross, London?	<p>My wife and I will be arriving in London via Heathrow Airport (LHR) and are staying at a hotel near King's Cross station. So, we were wondering what the best (which means fastest but also easiest when carrying two large pieces of luggage and two carry-ons) way to get from LHR to King's Cross?</p>  <p>I gather that, with only one changeover, we can take the Tube. However, in the interest of other passengers, we thought it would be best to take a taxi, or maybe a bus?</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>

6609	Schengen visa requirements and "validation"	<p>As an Indian citizen there are a bunch of requirements to get a Schengen visa. Some of them are: A reserved ticket (please do correct me if I am wrong) and confirmed hotel reservations.</p>  <p>Now, if I don't need reserved tickets but just an itinerary, do I really have to make the trip as soon as I get the visa or can I just do that any other time before the visa expires?</p>  <p>Is there a rule that says that "if you don't make your Schengen zone trip as soon as you get your visa, it would expire"?</p> 
26780	Is there a flight search engine that combines flights from different airlines?	<p>Is there a search engine that considers "mix&amp;match" flight combinations?</p>  <p>My current problem: I need to go from FRA to YLW (Frankfurt/Germany to Kelowna/Canada) on July 29th, and arrive no later than 5pm. The search engines I checked only offer €3000+ flights.</p>  <p>I found a 2-stop combo through LHR and YVR for half that price. I'll probably have to check my baggage out and back in twice, but if the layover times are long enough, who cares?</p>  <p>A <em>real</em> search engine could find that for me (or something that's even better). Or, hell, give me a place to bulk-download the flight schedules from and I'll program it myself (of course I'd also need a way to check seat availability …).</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Please read before answering. A search engine which does this should, at minimum, show the flight combination through LHR which I found manually. Note that I need to arrive before 5pm, <em>on the same day</em>.</p>  <p>Also note that this is a generic question; I'm not looking for a specific good flight here -- but the details are useful to illustrate whether an answer is actually valid. :-/</p>  <p>NB: Typo, should have been July 29th.</p> 
1932	Does being granted a Schengen visa and not going have any consequences?	<p>I'm granted a one-entry Schengen visa and now I can't go. Will having an unused visa in my travel passport have any consequences like future visas refusal? Do I need to do anything special?</p> 
3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p>

23873	Tromsø Aurora Borealis tours	<p>I'll spend a few days ( a weekend ) in Tromsø ( Norway ) at the beginning of March 2014. I know from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/18930/104">this</a> question that public transport will not help me to watch Aurora Borealis ( Northern Lights ) so I'm looking for a guided tour. A (mini)bus which takes me to a good spot and also takes me back.</p>  <p>It seems to me that quite a few tour operator offers Aurora Borealis tours. Which one should I choose? I'm looking for a short trip (couple hours), not for an overnight trip.</p>  <p>Is it necessary to book the trip in advance? I don't want to miss the opportunity to watch Aurora Borealis, but if book it now and the whether is terrible I loose my money.</p> 
34179	Can I own a French registered car as a non-resident?	<p>I would love to drive through Brazil and Suriname starting from French Guyana.

7043	Do I have to enter the UK on my UK passport?	<p>I'm a British National (Overseas), which basically means that while I don't have the right of abode in the UK, I am permitted to visit the UK without a visa. However, my passport has expired, and while it's being renewed, the schedule is a bit tight.</p>  <p>At the same time, I'm an US Citizen, and since I'm only planning to visit the UK, I don't need a visa if I enter on my US passport.</p>  <p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p> 
7665	What to do during a 4 hour layover at the Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT) in Kuala Lumpur?	<p>I have about a 4 hour layover at the LCCT in the evening.  This does not seem like long enough to get into the city and do anything useful.

I'll be travelling with 3 older teenage children.</p>  <p>Will I be able to transfer to the main terminal where there are more things to amuse?  Can this be done without going through customs and immigration?  I'm travelling on an Australian passport if that makes a difference for visas.</p>

34467	Short-term visa rules stated in Denmark website	<blockquote>   <p>If you have a visa that is valid for multiple entries for at least 6 months you can hand in an application for a new visa before the current visa expire. If you are granted a new visa it will be an extension of the current visa.

14828	What are the chances of success and the consequences of sneaking into business class?	<p>I've read some people writing that they've seen people be caught sitting in First/Business class when they have economy class tickets.

911	What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?	<p>I've travelled a lot.  Living in New Zealand or the UK means anywhere is likely a flight, but I've always flown economy.  Twice between LA and Auckland I managed to get the exit row after talking nicely to the check-in girl, but apart from that, nothing.  I've spoken to ticket agents, tried 'check in chicken' (where you wait until the last minute before checking in, hoping there's an overbooking of economy) but have never managed to get an upgrade, while others I know seemingly get them quite often.  What strategy have you used or do you suggest to achieve this?</p>  <p>My next flight is from Melbourne to Tokyo, and I plan on trying all of these ;)</p>  <p>(Related questions on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17183/101">car hire</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17026/101">hotel</a> upgrades)</p> 
11526	Are taxes included in fuel prices?	<p>I'm planning a road trip through SW USA. One of the decision factors on which car to rent is the estimated fuel cost. I don't mind paying some extra $ for a more luxury ride, but it has to stay within limits.</p>  <p>I checked <a href="http://www.vegasgasprices.com/index.aspx?fuel=A">http://www.vegasgasprices.com/index.aspx?fuel=A</a> to have an idea on current fuel prices, but I was wondering if I have to add another e.g. 10% tax (like you do with hotels) or if this is the real price I'll pay at the pump?</p>  <p>If I make a rough calculation (avg 3.5$/gallon, 23 mpg (*) for standard SUV, 3000 miles) I'm at 'only' 450$ for fuel.</p>  <p>(*): real data from <a href="http://www.fuelly.com/car/chevrolet/equinox">http://www.fuelly.com/car/chevrolet/equinox</a>, seems more likely than the numbers car dealers give.</p> 
21469	Why are prices published without tax in the US?	<p>On a recent trip to San Francisco it was always a surprise to see what to pay in stores. It was never as simple as just adding all the published prizes. There was always a surplus of taxes. Sometimes it was just an additional 50ct, but sometimes the increase in prize was substantial. The most extreme case being a bag of apples with a publised price of 1.99 but a final price of 4.50. Isn't there a single VAT and how can I know the prize to expect? If the taxes apply to everyone, why not simply publish the price including taxes?</p> 
27233	My flight was just canceled two weeks before the date	<p>Expedia just informed me that my flight with Ukrainian International Airlines was canceled. I'm flying from NYC to Kiev. This is an important business trip and I ordered tickets 2 months ago.  Expedia is offering me options 2 days before and 2 days after, but neither are good for me. The issue is not so much cost (though it is a pain), but more so the schedule. I really would prefer to leave on my selected date. </p>  <p>They are also offering a full refund, but I would end up losing a lot of money because I need to buy to tickets just 2 weeks in advance. </p>  <p>What are my options? Are airlines really allowed to just cancel on my reservation at a whim just 2 weeks in advance? I really feel screwed over here. Are there any rules or regulations that can help me? </p> 
2177	Can you travel to the US 6 months before your tourist visa expires?	<p>I've heard that you can't travel to the US 6 months before your visa expires.  Is that true?  Or does that only apply to 6 months until the expiration of the passport?  (Or does it apply to neither?)</p>

There must be viable non-flight options, right?</p>  <p>What are the best options by rail or coach? What would you recommend, taking duration, price and convenience into account?</p>  <p>How about <strong>NYC-Toronto</strong>, which by road is around 780 km (490 mi): are there good train/coach connections to that direction?

1340	Where is wild camping possible in Europe?	<p>Are there countries in Europe where wild camping with a tent allowed or at least tolerated? How high is the probability that someone will get angry at you or even call the police? </p>  <p>Please consider only cases where the travellers would be using common sense - not making noise, leaving no trace behind, staying out of sight of roads and houses, etc. In our case, the tent is small and easy to hide (dark green) and we won't need a camp fire.</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
3129	Do all American ATMs charge an extra fee for cash withdrawals on a foreign card?	<p>I've just gone to take some cash out of an ATM (Cash Machine) in Seattle. I visited about half a dozen in the end, and every single one wanted to charge me an extra fee (typically about $3) for the cash withdrawl on my (non-US) card. This was at bank ATMs in the centre of town, at their branches, rather than in a supermarket or somewhere.</p>  <p>In the end I had to give up and let one of them charge me (I needed cash!), but it was both unexpected and rather annoying. Having gone to the trouble of getting a card that wasn't going to charge me lots to use it abroad, I'm instead hit with fees from the owner of the cash machine.</p>  <p>Was I really unlucky to only find ATMs that wanted to charge me as a foreign user, or do all American ATMs do that? And if only some do, what banks should I be trying to find to avoid being hit with the fee?</p> 
25899	How do I ensure that my ATM card will work while traveling within the US?	<p>I am an American, and I have an American Visa debit card with "PLUS", "NYCE", and "AFFN" written on the back. </p>  <p>Several months ago, I traveled out of state to California and was surprised to have my card rejected at all ATMs there. (It still functioned as a debit card at shops however.) After I got back, I called and complained, and was told that I should call them before travelling.</p>  <p>Although no bank had ever obliged me to do so, I did so -- I called them beforehand to tell them I would be on the road throughout February and March, and asked them to not do any fraud protection for these months. However, my card was refused again.</p>  <p>I went to my local bank branch to complain -- they confirmed that I had called them beforehand, and that there was a note on my record -- and they were unable to explain what had happened. They told me to call some second number. (The one listed on the back of my card.) The person who answered my phone told me that my card "should have worked", but things would "work better" if I called this second phone number instead in the future.</p>  <p>Is this a common experience? Should I have any reason to believe that if I call this second number, that my ATM card will work in the future? Or should I take this as a sign that I should get an account with a second (perhaps bigger) bank?</p>

20770	Is it possible to manage without cash, but with credit cards only when visiting San Francisco?	<p>I have managed in the UK to go around without Pounds. You can easily go around the UK with credit cards only. Even paying for a beer in the pub, a bus ticket, or a train ticket is just a question of using a credit card. </p>  <p>Last time I visited the US, I tried the same approach, but failed. Even toll booths were cash only. This was in Florida.<br> Soon I will be visiting San Francisco on a short trip and I don't want to be bothered having to look for an ATM or figure out how much money I should exchange.</p>  <p>So can I go around San Francisco without cash in my pocket and pay for everything with plastic?</p> 
22092	Is 50 minutes of transit time ample in Amsterdam airport?	<p>Arriving in AMS in a Delta flight from Bombay at 7 AM. Departure at 7.50 AM in a KLM flight flying to Detroit. On a single leg ticket. Is this going to be time enough? Or should one just bolt as soon as the flight lands?  A google just shows the layout of the airport and there don't seem to be dedicated terminals for airlines.</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> In case the connecting flight is missed. On a ticket which is non refundable (non - everything - as this was the cheapest ticket), what happens when one misses a connection? Whose responsibility are the next steps? What should be the next steps? Reading other questions about AMS, with 50 minutes, it seems that the luggage is sure to be delayed. Sigh.</p>  <p><strong>Edit 2</strong> It's been a while, but when I was transiting, 50 minutes was pretty ample enough.</p> 
22299	Dubai (UAE) visa requirements when staying in the airport for a French citizen?	<p>I have read that, at the time of writing (2013), UAE visas are:</p>  <ol> <li>96-Hour : Valid for passengers in transit</li> <li>Tourist : Maximum 30 days</li> <li>Visit   : Maximum 90 days</li> </ol>  <p>But I am only connecting flights, so I am staying in the airport.

Travellers of most nationalities require   visas to enter Dubai, and regulations frequently change, so if you   wish to leave the airport while in transit through Dubai, please check   your visa requirements with your local UAE embassy before you start   your journey.

Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes.

I am wondering if I would be allowed to go out to experience the city for a while in some form a visitor visa.

24431	What is a good data plan for Internet surfing in northern Italy?	<p>I've checked the webpages of some their providers, but franly, just like in the case of those in my own language, I literally cannot find my way around them. So if you wouldn't mind sharing a word of two or advice.</p>  <p>I'm looking for a good solution for mobile internet surfing in northern Italy, that can be connected to a laptop (you know, that usb stick with a SIM card inside kind of thing). 15 Gb or so at some decent speed. Can you perhaps give a recommendation or two of what to get?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to define what I'm looking for exactly. A data plan of 15 Gb with an internet key (usb stick into which a SMS card goes) that you plug into a laptop. Preferably non-contractual, so I can cancel when I leave.<br> I am not interested in surfing on my mobile phone since due to size I still prefer the smaller Nokia-like models for calls (smaller to carry) - no internet on them.</p> 
34461	Shipping luggage vs. checking it for US domestic air travel	<p>I heard recently that, when traveling domestically in the U.S., it is better to ship your bags using a courier service rather than check them in. According to the source, this has three advantages:</p>  <ul> <li>Not having to pay extra to check in bags.</li> <li>Avoiding the possibility of lost bags as bags are "frequently" mishandled.</li> <li>Skipping the rush and confusion at baggage carousels at airports and exiting right out, finding that the bags have been already set in the hotel room by staff.</li> </ul>  <p>Is this a viable idea, and has anyone had success with it? Out of curiosity, what shipping company did you use and how much did you save (versus paying to check them in)?</p>  <p>I'm thinking of using USPS Priority Mail (2-day service to my destination) Large Flat Rate Box and using Space Bags to compact my clothing while still remaining under the (fairly generous) 70-pound weight limit.</p>  <p>Anyway, is shipping your bags to your destination a viable idea, and is it certainly better than checking bags in? I'm looking for an answer that describes whether it is a good idea, whether or not it's been successful in specific circumstances, and whether the advantages I've listed above apply in most cases.</p>

34095	How to dispose of a broken suitcase at an airport?	<p>Recently I had to catch a flight from New Delhi to Frankfurt. On arriving at the airport, I realized that my suitcase was broken at the bottom near the wheels. Probably due to its rough handling during my train travel to New Delhi. The break was quite close to the hinge and I did not want to risk it opening up during baggage handling. I thought of buying a new suitcase in the airport stores, but then wondered how I would dispose of the broken suitcase. The dustbins at the airport, as you know, are small and leaving an (empty) suitcase anywhere in the airport would raise suspicion and one may even be taken off the flight and taken for questioning!

7012	Transfer from Fiumicino Aeroporto to the City Center	<p>There are several possibilities to get from the airport to the city center in Rome, unless you are arriving after 11 PM. After this time there are only taxis and dedicated "luxury transfer cars" available. Is that right?</p>  <p>I found <a href="http://www.worldtaximeter.com/rome" rel="nofollow">this</a> website  and it says that there is a fixed fee of 40 Euros to get from Fiumicino Aeroporto to Roma Termini... Is that reasonable and/or dependable? How can I identify official taxis?</p> 
5224	Are there any airlines that still allow smoking on-board flights?	<p>Do any airlines still allow smoking on-board international flights, or is this something that has been banned across the board everywhere?

So I have: residence permit and photocopy of my passport.

19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
34975	Meaning of various fields on a Schengen visa stamp	<p>I'm going to my exchange programme in Germany for 4 months. For this, I got a Long Stay (D) visa.

35015	Does any airline in the world allow air travel without government identification?	<p>It seems that pretty much every airline requires at least one form of government identification for flights, even if it's a local flight within a single country.</p>  <p>Does any airline in the world form an exception to that rule? I was recently surprised to learn that <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5224/are-there-any-airlines-that-still-allow-smoking-on-board-flights">some airlines</a> still allow smoking on-board, so I'm sure there are also exceptions to the documents policy.</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p>

I was looking for a hotel at the first time, but it was quite expansive as I'll stay for two months, so I'm looking for a residence except hotel.</p>  <p>I heard that most Germany houses are monthly rent, but I don't know what should I bring or what the requirements are, like documents, visa, etc. I'm not looking for a big house or roomy apartment. It would be just a small area only for me to stay.</p>  <p>How can a tourist rent a house or apartment or any other residence in Germany except hotel?</p> 
7043	Do I have to enter the UK on my UK passport?	<p>I'm a British National (Overseas), which basically means that while I don't have the right of abode in the UK, I am permitted to visit the UK without a visa. However, my passport has expired, and while it's being renewed, the schedule is a bit tight.</p>  <p>At the same time, I'm an US Citizen, and since I'm only planning to visit the UK, I don't need a visa if I enter on my US passport.</p>  <p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p> 
16846	What is cheapest phone option for a short trip to Europe?	<p>I'm leaving for Europe in a couple days. I'm spending a few days in England and then a few days in Hungary before returning to the US. Unfortunately, I have not given much thought to my phone/internet options until now.</p>  <p>Anticipated needs: </p>  <ul> <li><p>5-10 phone calls total, all in-country, with no more than 60 minutes total talk time;</p></li> <li><p>30-50 text messages total, all in-country;</p></li> <li><p>light Web browsing, with a conservative (high) estimate of 75MB/day for data use.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I have a Verizon iPhone 5 and am willing to take it to use with a different SIM or, if I must, to use as-is with Verizon's "Global Services" rates. For reference, the latter are the same for both England and Hungary: $1.29/minute for voice, $0.50/$0.05 to send/receive texts, and $0.25/MB for data.</p>  <p>What is my best option? Best means both cheap/convenient, but weighted mainly toward cheap.</p>  <p>Happy to elaborate if more info needed.</p> 
9035	What to do when you can't print your boarding pass?	<p>I just use web checkin for my flight tomorrow. After that I should have printed my boarding pass. However, I realised that this is not possible. So what can I do now? I have already checked in, but no boarding pass. Is there any way to print that again at the airport? Or is it enough if I have my confirmation number? Or the boarding pass as a PDF?</p> 
21155	Can growing a beard cause problems in crossing borders?	<p>I just recently renewed my passport with a picture taken just after I shaved. I haven't shaved since (>3 weeks) and I kind of like it. I am even looking into how to maintain a beard, but that is a question for another platform.</p>  <p>Regarding traveling I am a bit worried that I look a bit different now then when I renewed my passport. On all my other photo IDs I don't have a beard either. </p>  <p>Long story short, should I shave before boarding my next flight, or are Immigrations/Customs/Airline staff trained to look through the beard?</p> 
18720	Do I need both a UK visa and a Schengen visa?	<p>I am a Filipino Citizen working in Qatar and have a valid Residence Permit.

31535	Can I just go to a country like Canada to apply for a new US Visa?	<p>I am a Russian citizen, staying in the US on an F1 visa. Unfortunately, the F1 expires after a year for Russian nationals, so it seems that I must fly back to Russia annually to apply for a visa every year. I was wondering if I could somehow avoid the flight back to Russia.</p>  <p>I know that if I had permanent residency in a third country, say Canada, I could just go to Canada and apply for a new F1 there.</p>  <p>However, currently my permanent residence is in Russia (according to my Russian internal passport and so on), even though I spend most of my time living in the States.</p>  <p>The website of the US consulate in <a href="http://toronto.usconsulate.gov/visas/advice-for-visa-applicants.html" rel="nofollow">Toronto</a> says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It is generally advisable for short-term visitors to Canada to apply in their home country for a U.S. visa</p> </blockquote>  <p>From this I conclude that I am not forbidden to apply for a visa in Toronto. They do not advise this, but okay, I'm not obligated to follow their advice. They also say:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It is usually more difficult for short-term visitors to Canada to demonstrate that they qualify for a visa and are often refused.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Again, okay, fair enough. But what does "more difficult" mean? I have gotten the same visa, and others, several times before without any issue. I can provide documentation demonstrating my application's legitimacy in considerable excess of what appears to be necessary. Would the consulate in Canada simply refuse a perfectly good application, just because I'm a foreign national, and leave me stranded in Canada with no choice but to buy a hasty ticket back to Russia (so I can try applying there)?</p>  <p>I've used Canada here just for the sake of a concrete example, but for the purposes of this question it can be any nearby country, such as Mexico. The point is that it is much easier for me to go to a nearby/neighboring country (Canada, Mexico, etc), than it is to go to my home country (Russia).</p> 
35202	Why must I lock the door of an aircraft lavatory before the light inside fully brightens?	<p>When I step into an aircraft lavatory, the light is off and there is an indicator light saying to lock the door.

3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle.

How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
25850	Ear protection on long flights?	<p>I have a pair of noise cancelling headphones which I love very much.  Putting them on during a long haul flight and keeping them on most of the time leaves me significantly less tense and more relaxed when I hit the ground.  They are the over-the-ear type which cost ~$200, and they are truly worth the investment.  The problem is...</p>  <p>When I travel for pleasure I like to travel light, typically only bringing a 35L backpack.  I usually bring a pair of earbud headphones, but they don't work nearly as well.  My questions are</p>  <ol> <li><p>Has anyone seen a good comparison of the in-ear noise cancelling headphones versus the over-the ear type?  Personal experience is ok, but I would be more interested in a comparison which includes some plots.</p></li> <li><p>I've been looking at non-headphone earplugs like the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00H2F87I8">LiveMusic</a>, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0044DEESS">Etymotic Research</a>, and <a href="http://www.earpeace.com/products/hd-hearing-protection">EarPeace HD</a>.

I am an Indian passport holder and I am in the US on a valid F-1 visa. Although Indian citizens fall under those who require DATV, I've seen on several websites that one can be exempted from this if he/she has a non-immigrant visa of the US/Canada and a confirmed return ticket. I meet both these requirements. Do I still need to get a visa? I would rather not, since I would have to travel for a whole day to get to and from the nearest embassy and my finals are right around the corner. </p>

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

35394	Can a Thai national married to a UK citizen enter the UK freely?	<p>I am a UK Citizen/Passport Holder, have a house in the UK but have been mainly in Thailand for the past twelve months, so currently deemed non resident in UK.  </p>  <p>The reason for being in Thailand is that I got married to a Thai lady, (Thai Passport).  All registered and legalized at the British Embassy in Bangkok.</p>  <p>Now, I also have a house in France, and we go there for a second time next month on a Schengen Visa (free, pretty automatic).  We do not plan to go back to Thailand.</p>  <p>We have applied for my wife to be issued with a French Resident card (Carte de Sejour), which means she can travel freely between EU countries and Thailand. </p>  <p>My question is:   Does the fact the she is married to an EU Citizen allow her to freely visit the UK?  Or does she still have to apply for a Visitor Visa?  In Practice we want to spend three months at a time in UK/France/UK/France etc until we decide exactly where we live - probably moving back to UK.</p>  <p>Hedging our options we have also applied in Thailand for a UK Settlement Visa for my wife.</p> 
6807	Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?	<p>I have a relative who has an EU passport. They emigrated out of the EU many years ago and have married (in Australia) an Australian citizen. They are planning on travelling around EU/Europe later this year (just a regular holiday, not working or anything)</p>  <p>I know the EU relative will have no problem getting into the EU (since they are an EU citizen), and that it will (probably) be very easy for an Australian citizen to get a tourist visa for many countries.</p>  <p>But I have a vague idea that the spouse of an EU citizen is (legally) allowed live and work in the EU for as long as they want, right? So in theory, the spouse could never be denied a visa, or have to pay for one, right?</p>  <p>How would the non-EU spouse enter the EU as 'spouse-of-EU-citizen' rather than 'general-tourist'? Is this possible? Is this beneficial?</p> 
35418	How can I get help understanding UK visa requirements?	<p>There are already many questions on visa requirements to enter the UK, including transit visas and visitor visa for family members (e.g. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/35394/can-a-thai-national-married-to-a-uk-citizen-enter-the-uk-freely">Can a Thai national married to a UK citizen enter the UK freely?</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/6807/non-eu-spouse-of-an-eu-citizen-is-visiting-eu-without-needing-a-visa-possible">Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?</a>).</p>  <p>Some of the rules seem very complicated. Where can I get authoritative information about that? Should I call the embassy like many people seem to advise?</p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey. He booked <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> and <em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>.<br> Somehow he needed to be earlier at location <em>B</em>, so he took a train and did not take the flight from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.</p>  <p>When he went to the airport to take the "back home" flight (<em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>), he was informed that his ticket was canceled because he did not take the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> flight. They canceled the ticket and sold it to someone else.</p>  <p>Is this normal? The company said it was their right to do so, and he could not get the flight back.<br> The company was Iberia.</p> 
995	What happens when a foreigner gets a traffic fine in the United States?	<p>What happens when a foreigner gets a speeding ticket / traffic fine in the United States? I've heard that the issuing officer will demand payment on site or will confiscate the drivers license.  That sounds a little too extreme to be true but on the other hand I'm not sure how they would enforce punishment for these infractions on people who can just leave the country.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p>

2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada?

9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
27672	Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don't want to stay in Greece at all?	<p>I want to travel to Spain however the requirements state that my UK residence permit be valid for 3 months after intended date of departure from the Schengen area. I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p> 
34318	Getting Schengen visa from a European country without stepping foot into it?	<p>I have an upcoming travel for a conference in country A. But their consulate is pretty busy and I would like to get my visa sooner.</p>  <p>Can I go to the consulate of a different country B which doesn't need appointment for visa applications and get my visa from there? I can schedule to be in A for 5 days and in B for 7 days.</p>  <p>What if I change my plans later not to visit country B at all and go a country C or just stay in A the whole time? Will there be issues when entering or exiting Schengen states?  </p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I called consulate of country B and talked with the visa officer. He told me since you are visiting country A for a conference that is your main destination even though you spend more time in A. He said the rules say: 1. main destination 2. if no, longest stay 3. if no, entrance. He told me that he is reluctant to issue me a visa and asked me to contact country A's consulate, if they don't take the application he will review it.</p>  <p>I called consulate of country A. First the operator told me to go to B then after telling her that I am going to A for business (conference), she told me that I should apply at theirs (A).</p>  <p>Looks like the key thing here is the conference not where I spend most of my time.</p>

5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
35513	If a baby is born on an international flight over international waters, what nationality are they?	<p>I seem to remember one of our members being on a flight when a baby was born, but can't find any reference to what happened to the baby in terms of citizenship.</p>  <p>Generally you hear about pregnant women being advised not to fly, but it does happen.  Sometimes the unexpected happens and a baby is born mid-flight.  Assuming it's an international flight and they're not over a country, what nationality does the baby get?</p>

30285	Booking tickets separately	<p>I plan to visit the Philippines this August. The direct flights from Colombo to Manila are quite expensive.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airasia" rel="nofollow">AirAsia</a> has flights from Colombo but they are a point-to-point carrier. They do not have any tickets that I can buy to fly from Colombo-Kuala Lumpur-Manila. They do have Colombo-Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur - Manila tickets.</p>  <p>If I have one day for the transit (17 hours) how safe it is to go with separate tickets? I know it becomes my responsibility to arrange alternative transport in case of a delay, but is it safe if I have a day?  I will need to exit the airport because there is a sleep over, but arrival and departure will be from same airport. </p>  <p>Both flights are 2 hours each. They have web check-ins. I will be carrying  luggage. I will have nothing to declare in customs. </p>  <p>My questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>If there are no direct flights, and the available single ticket offers are significantly expensive, would you consider traveling with two tickets?</li> <li>Are there any laws against it, at least any country-specific rules?</li> </ul>  <p>Thank you in advance. </p> 
26780	Is there a flight search engine that combines flights from different airlines?	<p>Is there a search engine that considers "mix&amp;match" flight combinations?</p>  <p>My current problem: I need to go from FRA to YLW (Frankfurt/Germany to Kelowna/Canada) on July 29th, and arrive no later than 5pm. The search engines I checked only offer €3000+ flights.</p>  <p>I found a 2-stop combo through LHR and YVR for half that price. I'll probably have to check my baggage out and back in twice, but if the layover times are long enough, who cares?</p>  <p>A <em>real</em> search engine could find that for me (or something that's even better). Or, hell, give me a place to bulk-download the flight schedules from and I'll program it myself (of course I'd also need a way to check seat availability …).</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Please read before answering. A search engine which does this should, at minimum, show the flight combination through LHR which I found manually. Note that I need to arrive before 5pm, <em>on the same day</em>.</p>  <p>Also note that this is a generic question; I'm not looking for a specific good flight here -- but the details are useful to illustrate whether an answer is actually valid. :-/</p>  <p>NB: Typo, should have been July 29th.</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else?

For this question, there is some restrictions as:</p>  <ul> <li>The seat cannot be far from both toilet and kitchen.</li> <li>The noise from turbines must be avoided.</li> <li>The class must be economy.</li> <li>A seat near an exit door is to be preferred.</li> <li>The model of aeroplane is generic (The tip should be generally enough to work for most planes: Boeing 777, 737, etc.)</li> </ul>  <p>Is there any trick to choose my seats better when buying a ticket?</p> 
17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
33891	Travel in the Schengen area after my residence card was lost or stolen	<p>I have already booked my flight from Italy to the Netherlands through Ryanair. I'm staying in Italy legally and have a <em>carta di soggiorno</em>. However, after booking my flight, my wallet was stolen, which contains all my IDs except my passport. I filed a police report, and I'm trying to get a new residence card. However, I need to go to the Netherlands ASAP. Will Ryanair accept the police report and receipt of getting a new residence card from the post office?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE (17.07.2014)</strong></p>  <p>Thanks for helping me out. BTW it's OK now. I went to our local CISL here in Florence, Italy, where they process your envelope for renewing your <em>permesso di soggornio</em> or <em>carta di soggiorno</em> (residence permit for foreigners) to be submitted to the post office. That's where you pay and get your postal receipt, and they make an appointment for you at the questura. Anyway, long story short, they processed a application for IMPROVISED residence permit which is good for 30 days to travel within the Schengen area, so all I have to do is go to the questura, bring my travel booking, the police report and copy of my passport. Now I can travel, and it's my first time to fly with Ryanair because I always use Transavia to go to Holland. =) Hope this helps for future persons who will have the same issue with lost or stolen residence permits...Just wish me luck that the questura will process my improvised residence permit immediately.</p> 
11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p>

I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
6678	Where can I find air-fare predictions?	<p>Yesterday I saw a documentary where some showed software that predicts developments in airfares. Similar to weather and traffic predictions a user would get a prediction of price developments when airfares for a specific connection are searched. Based on these prediction you could make an educated guess if you need to buy now, or better wait some time. </p>  <p>Since watching that documentary I have been searching for a booking site that uses this prediction feature. In the documentary they mention that such a webservice is not yet available in Europe, but since the Internet is more then Europe only, I expect to find a working example. No luck so far.</p>  <p>The documentary was a Dutch <a href="http://www.uitzending.net/gemist/455/Nederland-3/De_Rekenkamer.html">documentary</a>, where they explored the actual costs of flying an airplane from Amsterdam to London. The objective was to find a reason for the fluctuating real airfares asked.  </p> 
31409	Why are flights with hotel bookings cheaper?	<p>I booked a flight + 4 star hotel on Expedia on Thursday, arriving the following Sunday and checking out Monday, and the total cost was about $820 CAD.</p>  <p>Yet flights by themselves cost more, about $860. I checked multiple websites, including Kayak, Expedia, and the ones Cheapflights forwarded me to.</p>  <p>How does that work? If I was just flying somewhere, I could book a hotel which I would not stay in simply to get a discount on the flight? </p>  <p>Also, why would people use services like airbnb in this case? Is my situation just rare/unique?</p> 
7943	Why is there a 'secret carrier' option for a flight?	<p>When searching for a flight on <a href="http://www.kayak.com/#/flights/MIA-HKG/2012-06-30-flexible-1day/2012-07-12-flexible-1day/business">kayak.com</a> (not for me, I don't fly business), it shows a "Secret Carrier" option.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RoIEK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>What gives? Why are they unable to tell us even the code-share partner? What if you want to use miles? How does the travel agent know who they're booking with?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
13128	Renting a car in Ireland when under 25?	<p>My friend and I are planning a vacation to Ireland later this year. We'll be there for a week, flying into Dublin and then renting a car and driving around the country.</p>  <p>Both of us are 23. Are there any age restrictions on renting cars in Ireland? What would be the cheapest/best option for us?</p> 
33884	Are there any flights which permits a Sikh to carry a kirpan?	<p>I am a religious Sikh from Jalandhar, India. I have not travelled outside of the country for a single time so far. However my family is pestering me to take them for a jolly holiday trip to a different country.</p>  <p>I have a problem with that. I am deeply religious and I carry the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan">kirpan</a> always with me wherever I go, keeping in line with the tenets of my religion. However I can foresee that flight security are likely to view the kirpan as a dangerous weapon and will not allow me inside the aeroplane. </p>  <p>How can I overcome this? Is it possible to excuse me for religious reasons? Is there some tolerant flight/country which will empathise with my religious needs?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gfspq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
13405	Do I need to have travel insurance when crossing Schengen border?	<p>I have a multiple-entry one-year Schengen visa and I did have travel insurance first time when I crossed the border of Schengen, but it has expired already and I wonder if I need it during my next trips to Europe?</p>  <p>Is this something that you are obliged to have or it's ok not to have it?</p> 
33864	Documents necessary (and recommended) for first time travel to EU for US Citizen	<p>My fiancée who is an American citizen is travelling to visit me in France. Since I am not an American citizen and am from South Asia, working in France, I have no experience in advising her or searching for "what documentation is necessary" for her to travel to Europe.</p>  <p>I only know from Wikipedia's entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens" rel="nofollow">visa requirements for US citizens</a>, <a href="http://france.visahq.com/" rel="nofollow">visaHQ's drop down menus</a> and one of the <a href="http://www.consulfrance-chicago.org/spip.php?article477#short-stay-visa-less-than-days-requirements" rel="nofollow">French consulate's website</a> that she is entitled to visa-free travel to France (among a bunch of other countries). I also find that she does <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11225/do-i-need-an-esta-for-austria-as-a-us-citizen?rq=1">not need ESTA</a>.</p>  <p>However, since I have always been subject to visa rules wherever I have travelled, I just wanted to be doubly sure that she was in the clear to travel to Europe/France with ONLY a US passport.</p>  <p>Does she need any other method of authorization or travel document or other <em>recommended documents</em>? What should she carry with her in form of documentation? She is planning on staying here for 3 weeks (~23 days) so I am sure she doesn't need <a href="http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?article401" rel="nofollow">a long stay visa</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Additional questions</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Would my fiancée need <strong>travel specific health insurance</strong> similar to it being required for South Asians travelling to Europe for tourism?</li> <li>What about a <strong>certificate of finances</strong>? She has minimal finances so would it be ok for me to provide her with my bank statement as I would be doing the "spending"?</li> </ul> 
9926	London Heathrow airport - do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am traveling from the US to India via London Heathrow on November 6. I will be at LHR on 7th at 6:20 am and departing at 9:25 pm. I'm an Indian national and have a valid US visa.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay airside?</p>  <p>I have been scared that British Airways have stopped a few people from boarding flights (no details just rumors).</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa to stay landside? I want to do some sightseeing. What are the chances of getting past officials using transit without visa concession?</p>  <p>Real stories will help a lot to calm the butterflies in my stomach.</p> 
20171	How to prevent the passenger in front of you from reclining without notice?	<p>I can totally understand <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11234/can-you-expect-the-flight-attendants-to-tell-the-passenger-in-front-of-you-to-pu">someone reclining his seat on a long-distance flight</a>. On a short hop, I don’t have any sympathy for anyone using his “right” to recline his seat. The seat pitch on short flights these days make you an anti-social person by default if you choose to recline. I had my share of not being able to even drink a cup of coffee because somebody just wanted to “rest”.</p>  <p>I usually try to reposition my legs as much as possible, not only because I have to, but also to try to make the journey as unpleasant for the rester as it is for me. I’m aware that is just childish behaviour, so I am wondering whether there are more effective and more civilized countermeasures to make the flight pleasant for both of us.</p> 
35765	Which airlines ban the use of Knee Defenders during flight?	<p>I read that some airlines such as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/26/plane-diverted-as-passengers-fight-over-seat-reclining">United Airlines</a> ban the use of <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/knee-defenders-what-really-necessary-4108447">Knee Defenders</a> during flight. Is there any comprehensive list of airlines that ban the use of Knee Defenders during flight (or conversely a list of airlines that do not ban them)?</p> 
6889	Can I take an AVR development board on a plane?	<p>I'm travelling to the UK and while I'm away, I have a university assignment due, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get it finished before I leave, and would therefore need to work on it while travelling.  </p>  <p>The problem is that the assignment requires a development kit that might appear at first glance to be something else:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cSPxY.png" alt="photo of development kit"></p>  <p>I will be passing through Sydney, Abu Dhabi &amp; Heathrow airports.  Would I have any issues taking this AVR board in my checked baggage?  What about carry-on?</p> 
16266	Can I bring my desktop computer as check-in baggage on a flight?	<p>I am moving from Malaysia to the US, and planning to bring my desktop computer with me. I plan to pack it in my checked-in luggage. Will the computer risk being damaged? Any precaution should I take to reduce this risk? Will there be any trouble with the airline or immigration about bringing computer?</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
1932	Does being granted a Schengen visa and not going have any consequences?	<p>I'm granted a one-entry Schengen visa and now I can't go. Will having an unused visa in my travel passport have any consequences like future visas refusal? Do I need to do anything special?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
34714	Dual nationality, not sure how to switch passports!	<p>I am a US and EU citizen residing in the US. I am going backpacking throughout Africa and want to travel on my EU passport. My flight is US–Paris–Tunis–Cairo. When do I use each passport? Do I book my flight on the US passport or the EU passport? Can I leave the US on my US passport and then switch mid-flight and enter Paris with my EU passport?</p> 
27110	Where are the start points for the Phoenix Trail between Princes Risborough & Thame (UK)?	<p>Can somebody tell me specifically where the start/end points are for the Phoenix Trail between Princes Risborough and Thame in the UK? I've looked on Google, and I <em>think</em> I've found the route, but when I look on Google Street View at the points where the mustard-coloured line ends, I see no signs. Furthermore it seems to be high street and other roads.

30807	Travelling with 2 check-in bags	<p>I am looking for a solution to carry 2 check-in (around 50 lbs each) roller bags to airport.</p>  <p>Since I am alone its hard to pull both at same time. Options I think I have:</p>  <ol> <li>Use taxi and pay him around 80bucks</li> <li>Use option like luggage cart that can carry up to 100lbs.</li> <li>Any other innovative idea.</li> </ol>  <p>In other words, I am trying to understand the usefulness of luggage carts: e.g.  <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/x9XVu.jpg" alt="cart"></p>  <p>(<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000USIM5M" rel="nofollow">cart at Amazon)</a> </p>  <p>or something as easy as travel dolly e.g.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1OfWI.jpg" alt="dolly"></p>  <p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B005N11RQ2" rel="nofollow">(dolly at Amazon)</a></p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
34966	What if one family member doesn't have a photo ID for domestic air travel in India?	<p>My friend has booked tickets for vacation in India (domestic travel), but realized that his wife doesn't have any photo ID.

34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
10247	Statistically, is there a safest seat on the plane if it crashes?	<p>So to clarify, there are lots of different planes, so for the sake of argument, there are areas:</p>  <ul> <li>front left</li> <li>front right</li> <li>front middle</li> <li>forward front, right, middle</li> <li>over the left wing</li> <li>over the right wing</li> <li>middle, between the wings</li> <li>mid-way back, left, right, or middle</li> <li>at the back left, right, or middle</li> <li>pilot seat</li> <li>co-pilot seat</li> <li>jump-seat, if it exists</li> </ul>  <p>So that's 18ish possible safe zones in the plane.  Is there a particular area that statistically people have survived more (or less) in?</p> 
35023	Where is the safest place in an airplane?	<p>Is there such a thing at all? I feel the front is dangerous because it may hit the ground first. I also feel that near the wings is not safe because they are fuel tanks.</p> 
780	Buying Paris metro tickets from Eurostar before/during the journey?	<p>Whenever a Eurostar gets into Brussels, and especially when one gets into Paris, there is always a mad scramble for the metro ticket machines, and if you weren't in the first coach then a very long queue...</p>  <p>A couple of years ago I did manage to buy Paris metro tickets from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostar">Eurostar</a> information desk in London before I left, as described <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Paris-metro.htm">here</a>. (It was at the information desk on the far right after security and passport checks). I seem to recall they even sold me the tickets in sterling at the day's exchange rate!</p>  <p>I've subsequently recommended this to a friend, who wasn't able to buy the tickets from the information desk, and instead had the long queue at the metro ticket machines on arrival.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if Eurostar are still normally selling metro tickets from the information counter? And/or does the buffet on board sell them? (I think I've once heard an announcement about that)</p> 
17493	Can you register a same-sex marriage while a tourist rather than a resident?	<p>Of course there is Las Vegas. But so far, the US does not recognize same-sex marriage. Only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" rel="nofollow">13</a> countries so far seem to have recognized the right to conduct same-sex marriage.</p>  <p>If you are not a resident/citizen of one those thirteen countries, is it possible to get married in one of these 13 countries as tourist? Say a same-sex marriage equivalent of Las Vegas.   </p>

35500	Can I take my disassembled desktop computer on a flight from Turkey to the UK? (some new regulations)	<p>I've read that there are some new regulations for electronic devices at UK airports. If the devices are in your hand baggage, they must be fully charged and you have to demonstrate, that they are working, or something like that.</p>  <p>Now what if I take my desktop computer components - Motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU, Hard Drive (no case). I plan to wrap them with a lot of plastic bubble foil.</p>  <p>Would they want me to re-assemble the components and check if they are working? And would such baggage be a cause of some security freak out?</p>  <p>I'm flying from Istanbul to Edinburgh with Turkish Airlines.</p>  <p>I can't afford to waste time giving explanations to police all day for nothing on either the Turkish or British side.</p>  <p>Here's an article I found (<a href="http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2011/03/18/bomb-scare-at-edinburgh-airport/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2011/03/18/bomb-scare-at-edinburgh-airport/</a>)</p>  <p>What do you think?</p>  <p>Thanks.</p> 
36027	Airline compensation for failure to check visa eligibility?	<p>Asking from Australia and about Malaysian Airlines specifically: </p>  <p>How good a case is it to seek compensation for flights if the airline failed to check documentation correctly and let us board in the first place? </p>  <p>My partner and I boarded a flight to a destination for which, it turned out, he was unable to gain a visa-upon-entry into (Australian travel document, Thailand). </p>  <p>We were subsequently put on a flight back to Australia of which we were told we were 'covered' by our return flight fees. In short, we essentially lost the return fees in full, and incurred additional costs from an airport hotel overnight due to flight connection times.</p>  <p>Is this something that could've been avoided if the airline had checked the validity of the travel document in the first place, so that we could have at least remained at home and claimed a refund for the return leg of the journey? </p>  <p>What is the best way to go about addressing this issue?</p> 
4912	Can two different planes share the same flight number?	<p>There's a daily flight, let's call it AB 1234 which leaves at 11am with a flight duration of more than 13 hours.  I noticed that every day, the same flight AB 1234 leaves at 11am.  It seems physically impossible for the same plane to travel 13 hours and return in about a similar amount of time to still make the next day flight.</p>  <p>Is it possible for two or more different planes to share the same flight number?</p>

Travellers of most nationalities require   visas to enter Dubai, and regulations frequently change, so if you   wish to leave the airport while in transit through Dubai, please check   your visa requirements with your local UAE embassy before you start   your journey.

23503	Can I get back into Australia on a tourist visa if I have an unpaid fine?	<p>I am from Canada, and I have been in Australia for 2 years on a working visa.

If I leave the country, can I get back in on a later date, on a tourist visa, if I haven't paid this fine?</p>  <p>If this is true, and I cannot get a tourist visa with an existing fine, can I pay it from outside Australia, and <em>then</em> apply for my tourist visa, hassle free?</p> 
27151	How does the SNCF Voyageur program work?	<p>I'm planning some TGV trips soon, but despite being a member of two different Railteam frequent traveller programs already, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9662/can-i-credit-travel-on-one-railteam-member-to-the-frequent-traveller-program-of">from this question</a> it doesn't look like I'd be able to credit the journeys on a TGV to either of them.</p>  <p>I think, if I want to get any credit for them, I'll need to join the <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">SNCF Voyageur Program</a>. The <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">English language website for it</a> has some broad details about the program, but doesn't really explain much about how you earn credit from TGV journeys, nor about redeeming them. It links through to various French language websites, but these all seem to have even less information on them, with all the important details apparently only available after you log in. (Since joining seems to take about a week, you can't just sign up and immediately see the details, grr....)</p>  <p>If someone with better google-fu than me, or someone who's a member who can log in to the site to get the full details, is able to post about the program that would be great. Specifically, I'm interested in:</p>  <ul> <li>What tickets I can and can't get credit for</li> <li>What's the earnings rate (per segment, per mile, per euro, something else?)</li> <li>How do the different levels work?</li> <li>How do the rewards work?</li> </ul>  <p>Hopefully from that, I can work out if there's actually any point in me joining the program for just a few trips or not!</p> 
28926	Can I earn SNCF Voyager points, for a booking made without the membership number?	<p>Having now <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/27151/26">worked out what the SNCF Voyageur program is</a>, I've gone ahead and joined it, as I've a number of TGV journeys coming up in the coming months.</p>  <p>The slight wrinkle is that most of these TGV tickets have already been purchased, and none of them have my Voyageur membership number on them.

21090	Biometric passport: How can I know if the chip is still working? Does it matter?	<p>My biometric passport inadvertently spent some time under the rain. It's not badly damaged but some sheets are a bit deformed and there are tiny brown spots on the side. I am wondering if there is an easy way for me to determine if the chip is still working. If it does not, can I still use the passport? Which countries require a biometric passport or actually use the data?</p>  <p>Also, how much of a problem can a lightly damaged/worn out passport be? Is it more likely to be an issue in some countries than others?</p>  <p>PS: Right now, I am preparing for a possible trip to the US and since there is still time, I will most likely ask for a (<s>costly</s>, turned out requesting a new one was free, for some reason) new passport just in case but I would be curious to know if that's really necessary or about potential issues in other countries as well. The passport in question is still valid for more than three years, still has many free pages and was issued by a EU country participating in the visa waiver program.</p>

23849	Is checkmytrip.com overloaded? Is there an alternative?	<p>I like to check my flight itenary on <a href="http://www.checkmytrip.com">checkmytrip.com</a>. The main reason is that while airline's webpages and check-in systems often don't provide some information out-of-the-box (for instance the aircraft type), checkmytrip seems to have the information ready all the time. (Yes, you can request the airline to tell you what type of aircraft will be used, but usually by a phone call or so, which is not convenient).</p>  <p>However, quite often it happens that the page simply doesn't load. Is the webpage overloaded? Is there any alternative that would provide the same information?</p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey.

I will be leaving Singapore permanently and my intent is to ultimately land back in Australia, at least for a while, but this may not happen.</p>  <p>From whom can I buy travel insurance? Most consumer travel insurance plans which offer the type of cover I want (Covermore et al) assume you have a "country of residence". Effectively, I don't and that would invalidate my policy.</p>  <p>As a bonus, I'd prefer if I could specify I'll only be in the USA for three weeks and only pay the extra premium for that time, rather than it doubling the cost for the whole six months.</p>

21347	Why do hotel booking sites ask for the number of people? Does it matter how many I say?	<p>I was planning a stay at a hotel in Chicago for an overnight layover and checking prices on the hotel's booking site (in this case the Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport) for a room with 2 double beds. The site asks for the number of people in my party. In my case there will be 3 adults, no kids.</p>  <p>I experimented with different answers to the # of adults question and found that 1-2 people sharing a room gave a price of $94, for 3 people it was $118, and 4 people raised it to $142. </p>  <p>I don't get the extra charge since it will be the exact same room in all of those situations. Do most hotels do this? If I just book the room specifying 2 people and bring a 3rd is there any risk involved? </p>  <p>I'd also like to hear any insight from hotel insiders about what is behind the logic of charging different rates for the same room depending on how many people will be in it (assuming you don't need an extra roll-away bed). It would make sense if there was a free breakfast or something, but this hotel doesn't offer that.</p> 
22916	Can I pick up my luggage between flights with the same company?	<p>I have a flight from Madrid to Aalborg with a stop in Amsterdam.

8125	How rigorous are Amtrak in enforcing luggage rules?	<p>Looking at Amtrak trains between NY and Boston, I found that all had "no checked luggage" save for a midnight train (less than ideal for a relaxing vacation).</p>  <p>Looking at <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/Satellite?SnippetName=IBLegacy&amp;pagename=am/AM_Snippet_C/SnippetWrapper&amp;ibsref=NoCheckedBaggage">this reference</a>, it's not really that restrictive as you can take bags on to the train.  My question is on the size restrictions of 28" x 22" x 14" (70cm x 55cm x 35cm in my parlance).  We'll be travelling with a backpack taller than this, albeit not much (maybe four to eight inches/10 to 20 cms), so I was wondering how much effort Amtrak puts into enforcing this?  Has anyone else travelled with an oversized baggage as "carry on"?</p> 
33777	Change of plans: Going to another country with a single-entry Schengen visa	<p>I have a Schengen visa issued from a Swiss Embassy. Can I use it to enter France as my first entry to the Schengen area?</p> 
7585	What exactly is a open-jaw flight?	<p>Recently, I was looking for a flight from A to B and then a flight back from C to A. Using my English dictionary, I found that this is called an open-jaw flight. However, several native English speaker stated, that they never heard the term. Others mentioned that it is only an open-jaw flight if BC is shorter than AB and/or CA.</p>  <p>Therefore I would like to see a canonical definition of an open-jaw flight. I'm also interested in a term that describes the flight legs described above. In German it is called Gabelflug, but what is the English term?</p> 
6955	What are the "rules" for multi-city flights?	<p>As I understand things, airlines generally give discounts for round-trips that consist of a flight from A to B followed by a flight from B to A.  How does this logic work for multi-city flights?  As an example (but don't focus strictly on this example), what about a flight from A to B followed by a flight from C back to A?  What logic is applied to determine whether to charge as separate one-way trips or as a discounted multi-city trip?  Is the important part that the trip begin and end in the same space, or does there need to be an unbroken cycle?</p>  <p>I know I can prod travel search engines for specific examples, but if I understand the rules it can help in my search.  Is this airline dependent?  Does it matter whether the flights are domestic or international (I'm only concerned here about domestic)?</p> 
23442	Will boarding a two-leg flight at the stopover airport cause any problems?	<p>Recently, I purchased a two-leg plane ticket from New York City (LGA) via Philadelphia (PHL) to my final destination (which we'll call XYZ). I happened to be coming from a place from which it wasn't very much harder to get to PHL than to get to LGA. This being the case, I very much wanted to just purchase a ticket from PHL to XYZ and call it a day, but for whatever reason, the PHL-XYZ ticket by itself cost something like twice as much as LGA-PHL-XYZ, so I ended up buying the latter.</p>  <p>This brings me to my question: having purchased the LGA-PHL-XYZ ticket, could I simply forgo the LGA-PHL leg and head straight to PHL to catch my flight to XYZ? Would this cause any problems (e.g. with the TSA or whatnot)?</p> 
27672	Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don't want to stay in Greece at all?	<p>I want to travel to Spain however the requirements state that my UK residence permit be valid for 3 months after intended date of departure from the Schengen area. I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p>

19339	Huge difference in price between online travel agents and airline website	<p>I often notice this rather strange occurrence when searching for fares through Kayak (it may not be specific to Kayak but it is the tool I use the most).</p>  <p>It is that, for the same flight, there is a huge difference in the price shown from one web travel agent to another as well as the price shown on the official airline website.</p>  <p>Here is an example:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qUEud.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>How is Webjet able to sell this for so much cheaper (> $2000) compared to everyone else?</p>

11254	Your address at destination: What if you don't know any address?	<p>Often, when entering a country, you must fill a form that asks, in particular, where you will stay.</p>  <p>What if you don't know yet?<br> Even worse, what if you don't have your guidebook in hand luggage, and thus can't even pick a hotel? (lack of preparation happens, especially when told by your company to immediately fly)</p>  <p>In such cases, would it be dangerous to write <code>Hotel Hyatt</code>? (because most big cities have one)<br> Or will you get less trouble by just writing <code>Sorry I don't know, I will choose upon arrival</code>?</p>  <p>(not talking about North Korea nor Russia, where they actually check bookings)</p>

28943	Forgot to submit consumption tax (GST) declaration form upon exiting Tokyo	<p>I travelled to Japan last year and bought some stuff from shops in Tokyo which were subject to return of consumption tax (GST). However, I forgot to submit those consumption tax receipts (which the shop cashiers attached to my passport) to the customs counter in the airport when I exited back to my country. What shall I do now? Will I be blacklisted and refused entry into Japan when I visit Tokyo again sometime in the next few months? Do I need to pay a penalty, and if so, how much?</p> 
33696	Where to leave luggage in Gdansk?	<p>Is there another place than the station to leave luggage in Gdansk, Poland?</p>  <p>I was in the station, and there were around 10 lockers all full. I am not sure if I was in the right place though. I am not sure I was in the right place and I didn't have oportunity to check again. I will need to leave luggage for one day and I was wondering if either there was another place or even if the station has more lockers that I did not see.</p>

21513	Overstaying ESTA Visa waiver in the US	<p>I recently discovered that I will be over-staying my 90 day visa waiver by 2 days. My question is about leaving the country as I fly from NYC to LA before flying home to Australia and I'm wondering that if because the Visa has technically expired will I be allowed to fly from one US state to another or will I be forced to fly directly out of the US from NYC?</p> 
30280	Dual US/UK citizen. Will this show when my UK passport is scanned in America?	<p>I have dual US and UK citizenship, but the US citizenship has only just been realized (wasn't aware I had claim to US citizenship earlier).</p>  <p>Unfortunately I haven't received my US passport yet. Can I still travel to the US only using my UK passport?</p>  <p>I understand that the US does require citizens to travel on a US passport, but would they even know that I am a dual citizen if I've only ever traveled on my UK passport? (Especially considering that my US passport has never been used before in any form - as I haven't received it).</p>  <p>If I was only entering the US for a small trip,  would it show on the screen that I also have US citizenship when they scan my UK passport?</p>

Is 6 hours transit time enough to leave Incheon airport for a bit to see something of Seoul? It might make my trip more worthwhile to see something of South Korea too. I don't know much about the busyness of the airport around this time, and travel time between the airport and the city, so that's why I am asking.</p>

36557	Why were water bottles confiscated in a boarding gate jetway in Hong Kong?	<p>Seeing another question about taking water bottles onto planes reminded me of an interesting incident I ran into once. During a layover in Hong Kong in late May of 2013, as we were boarding a flight to Los Angeles, there were security personnel actually in the jetway searching through everyone's carry-on luggage and confiscating water bottles that still had water in them. Since only empty bottles were allowed to get through security or transfer security to even get to the gate, this means that all of the water being confiscated was either purchased or obtained from a water fountain in the airside concourse. As such, I was confused as to why it was being confiscated. Also, this was not done on a different departure I had from Hong Kong only a couple of weeks before that or on any other flight I've ever been on anywhere.</p>  <p>So, my question is, <strong>does anyone know why they would confiscate water that was obtained in the secure departures area of the airport in the jetway as passengers were boarding a flight?</strong></p>  <p>The only even remotely reasonable explanation I could think of is that it could have something to do with taking extra precaution to prevent the spread of avian flu, since there was an outbreak in China at the time, though I didn't hear any kind of announcement of this not being allowed until we were already actually in the jetway past the boarding gate.</p>  <p>Less likely, this was during the time that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" rel="nofollow">Edward Snowden</a> was in Hong Kong, so perhaps this was a pretense to search luggage of U.S.-bound flights for some reason related to that, but this seems very unlikely, especially since this was between the time he arrived in Hong Kong and when he went public with the information.</p>

3211	Which city to visit in Europe during January?	<p>In the first half of January, I'm planning to go on a 3-4 days city sightseeing trip in Europe. I'm looking for a nice location, but I'm not so sure which places are a reasonable choice in winter. I prefer to do some sightseeing, museums and other stuff like this I don't like very much, expect they're extraordinary good.</p>  <p>I would like to visit a city that has a lot of sights that can be visited also during winter and it shouldn't be too crowded. Additionally I should be easy reachable from Switzerland. Because the weather is often not so stable in January I would prefer a city that also offers some indoor activities.</p>  <p>Has anybody a good recommendation? The following cities I don't want to visit: Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, London, Munich, Berlin, Stockholm, Oslo, Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Budapest and every city in Switzerland, Italy and Austria.</p>

798	In the US, what's a good prepaid GSM SIM card without a phone?	<p>My daughter is going to spend the next school year (August 2011 to June 2012) in Memphis, TN as an exchange student from Switzerland. She'd very much like to use her iPhone during her stay in the United States.</p>  <p>What are her options for getting prepaid talk, text and data services without also having to buy a new phone? I realize that she'll be limited to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile because of the GSM network.</p>  <p>As far as I've read, T-Mobile SIM cards only work on T-Mobile branded phones, so is AT&amp;T her only option there?</p> 
1677	Are there data plans for travelers in the USA?	<p>I intend to travel to the US for a month, and I would really like to use a lot of data traffic during the trip, for browsing, maps, Skype calls, etc. How can I do that? Should I buy a SIM? Do I have to order one in advance, or are data SIMs readily available in the airport? Is there any website that can show me competing options and maybe compare them?</p>  <p>Also, I guess SIMs are linked to one specific carrier. Does it matter which cellular carrier I choose, or do all have similar coverage and do all support GSM phones? Does it change from state to state? e.g. do some of the more states, like Hawaii, have limited coverage for some of the carriers?</p>  <p>In short I am clueless here, and would really appreciate any information about this.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: meanwhile I have found <a href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">this comparison between various data sim suppliers</a>, seems very useful though I'm not sure how reliable or up-to-date this page is.</p> 
34818	Why is security screening done at the gate at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam) in the non-Schengen area?	<p>I've noticed that when taking non-Schengen flights at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam), there is no centralized security check after you enter the airport and go through passport control. Instead, the security check happens right at the gate. The security checkpoint opens about an hour before the flight departs from that gate. This system seems to have a huge number of disadvantages:</p>  <ul> <li>It must be really expensive - there's an X-ray machine, metal detectors, and for some gates even millimeter wave scanners at <em>each</em> gate. </li> <li>Also, adding to the expense, there are washrooms at <em>each</em> gate, since passengers can no longer use the common area washrooms after passing through security.</li> <li>It's really inconvenient for the passengers. There's no way to reach the seats inside the gate area before the security checkpoint opens, so people are forced to either wait far away in other areas of the airport, or (as I've seen many people do) sit on the floor, which is especially a problem for the elderly, etc.</li> <li>The security lineup tends to be very long, since all of a sudden an entire plane-full of people tries to pass through a checkpoint with very limited equipment (i.e. usually just 1 x-ray machine)</li> <li>Once inside the area, it's essentially an entire plane-full of people in a small area with no way to spread out, so there's always a shortage of seats</li> <li>There's no way to buy e.g. a bottle of water (not to mention duty-free alcohol) in the secure area of the airport and bring it onto the plane, something that is generally allowed in typical airports</li> <li>Security screening personnel must roam around the airport from gate to gate</li> </ul>  <p>I can think of only one advantage of this system: Arriving flights from non-Schengen countries (whose passengers must be re-screened for security) can just let people out of the plane through the gate - there's no need to "route" them through the secure area to a non-secure area, since everything is essentially a non-secure area. But surely this could have been solved at the airport design stage, as it is solved in many airports worldwide? Is this just a design oversight or a conscious decision? Are there other reasons to use such a system that I'm not thinking of? Is this typical in other European airports?</p>

36755	UK Visa Refused - Can I reapply immediately?	<p>I applied for the UK tourism visa.</p>  <p>I mentioned that I was going to travel only for 2 weeks. However I got rejected because I didn't mention in the application, that I was working, nor mentioned that my dad has a job also.</p>  <p>Although I gave them my dad's bank statement, they were worried that I might go to the UK and not come back, because I might not have enough funds to return to Egypt which is not true.</p>  <p>My mum wrote my application and she didn't know that she was supposed to put my dad's job or mine as well, or whether I stayed with my family or alone. I suspect that's the reason why the visa application got rejected.</p>  <p>I want to apply again for the visa because I want to visit my cousin - she lives there, plus I need to go on a vacation. I want to know whether it's possible for me to apply again for the visa now, or do I have to wait for another six months to reapply?</p>

6543	Entry into US with unpaid medical bills and ticket for careless driving	<p>While on vacation in the US last year, my wife and I was in a traffic accident. My wife had to spend more than a week in hospital before we could fly home. Our insurance is covering everything, but we keep receiving more bills in the mail. We are forwarding the bills to our insurance company, who tells us that they are taking care of them, but they are probably not paying them immediately (I expect there are a lot of paperwork involved). We can see that some of the invoices have strange addresses on them and have taken a long time to reach us, so we are a bit worried that there might be others that haven't reached us yet.</p>  <p>Also, since the accident was partly my fault, I received a ticket for careless driving, which I have paid.</p>  <p>We are going back to the US in a few weeks on vacation. Can any of this give us problems in immigration or elsewhere? Is there anything we should do or special papers we should bring?</p>

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

The only place I've found information for doing this requires a round trip.  I don't want to go round trip.  I want to spend some months in Europe and I don't care where in Europe I start.</p>

6592	What to do if I lost my passport before flight in another country?	<p>I'm just asking this question for my info. I will be traveling from India to Amsterdam on a short trip.</p>  <p>What should you do if you lose your passport or the passport gets stolen (especially in a Schengen country)?</p>  <p>As I read on the Internet that if someone loses his passport, the following things have to be done:</p>  <ul> <li>Contact the airline immediately and change the flight date to at least 2 months ahead because it will take at least 2 months to get a new passport.</li> <li>Contact the nearest police station and file the report of lost passport</li> <li>Go to the embassy of your country to apply for a new passport. This will take 2 months after applying</li> </ul>  <p>Until you get the new passport you will have to stay in town for approximately 2 months. So you should have extra money for that.</p>  <p>Is the above information correct? Please reply if you have a more detailed and more accurate answer.</p>

10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule.

34723	Where to rent a non-city bike in Amsterdam for a reasonable price?	<p>I'd like to rent a bike while in Amsterdam to do a little trip. Is there a bike rental, which rents decent sport bikes? It seems like most rentals are aimed at renting city bikes, which I do not prefer. I only found one rental renting road bikes, but the price was in the area of 70+ euro per day, which seems ridiculous.</p> 
34687	Good route for a 1-day bike trip around Amsterdam	<p>I'd like to take a one day biking trip in Amsterdam in October, when I will be coming there for a conference. Could you recommend a scenic path/trail I could take? Please, if possible, include bike path numbers so I can look them up in my map.</p>  <p>I'm a fairly fit cyclist, so length in the area of 50-60 km should not be a problem, especially considering there aren't many hills in the Netherlands :-).</p>  <p>If you can, also recommend a bike rental which rents sporty bikes as opposed to the usual city bikes most dutch people use.</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p>

Or do I have to leave the country first, and then re-enter through Italy?</p>

My visa is only for 3 months and will expire in Dec 4th, 2014. It also has the name and address of the company in my passport.</p>  <p>I spoke to my boss and he said it was not necessary that I go to the training and that I could use my visa for vacations. My concern is the name and address in my passport.  I have family in Las Vegas and would really love to spend Thanksgiving with them.  </p>  <p>Can I travel to another state that is not Miami, FL?</p>

35057	Why is a change of carrier on Greyhound no transfer?	<p>The below schedule is an example of a Greyhound trip. It says there are zero transfers on the route.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rT9KK.png" alt="Example schedule Greyhound"></p>  <p>However, when looking at the schedule, I see that there is a change of carrier and schedule.

31549	Am I allowed to use my valid ESTA again for a short visit to the U.S. after being denied a B2 visa for 1 year?	<p>I have a valid ESTA since February 2014 which is valid until 2016. I used it last month to visit the U.S. for 2 days. After that I applied for a B2 Visa to stay with friends for 1 year which has just been denied.

6105	What time does the train from Yerevan arrive in Tbilisi?	<p>Two friends of mine told me they were taking the train yesterday from Yerevan, which would travel overnight, and arrive today in Tbilisi.</p>  <p>Unfortunately they didn't tell me what time the train is expected to arrive!</p>  <p>Now official train timetables in this part of the world seem to be hard to find at least if you can only search in English. Searching generally I find somewhat consistent answers in forums on travelling in the opposite direction from Georgia to Armenia, but the information for this direction seems to be out of date. I am told trains leave from Yerevan on even days of the month but I'm not sure this is current as others have told me there is a day train and a night train and the most current online answer I can find, from September 2011, <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=2101710" rel="nofollow">even states the train is not overnight</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The last option can be the train that leaves Yerevan at 3.00 pm and reaches Tbilisi at 11.00 pm.</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>So what is the current timetable for trains from Yerevan Armenia to Tbilisi Georgia as of March 2012?</strong></p> 
5932	What time do buses and/or marshrutkas leave from Tbilisi for Batumi?	<p>I'm trying to find out for a hostel guest what time buses and/or marshrutkas depart Tbilisi to get to Batumi.</p>  <p>I can find on the Internet that the travel time is between four and six hours and that the price should be 18 GEL (Georgian lari).</p>  <p>But I can't seem to find anywhere that has a timetable.</p>  <p>Are there both buses and marshrutkas or only one or the other?</p>  <p>Do marshrutkas leaves whenever they are full or do they adhere to a timetable? Even if they leave when full I assume there is a set time for the first and last trip.</p>  <p>Ideally I'd like to know for both Ortachala and Didube bus stations since I believe there are departures from both.</p>

We leave in two days so we cannot even give it for extension. How should we proceed? </p>

30947	Name has "Mr" appended on reservation, airline will not reply	<p>I recently booked tickets to travel by plane from the UK to Greece. The website I booked through (airfasttickets.co.uk) lists my name correctly, as "Mr Georgios [My surname]", exactly the same as in my passport.</p>  <p>When I log in to the airline's (Aegean Air) website using the booking number the above website gave me, my name is somehow listed as "Georgiosmr [My surname]" (the title "Mr" seems to have been appended to my first name).</p>  <p>Since I'm going to be travelling from the United Kingdom and my name is obviously non-english, I'm afraid they may have doubts about the "mr" at the end being a mistake instead of part of it and deny me entry.</p>  <p>I've sent two e-mails to Aegean but it's been more than a week since the last one and 2-3 weeks since the first and they haven't replied. Calling them would be too expensive since they're based in a different country than my phone provider and I'd rather avoid it.</p>  <p>Is there anything else I can do? Is it likely that they'll think "mr" is part of the name of the ticket's owner?</p>

37141	To wait or not to wait - regarding a particular Airplane price	<p>Today (Friday) I was about to book a round trip ticket <strong>Mumbai(BOM) - Beijing(PEK) - Mumbai(BOM)</strong> via Hong Kong by Cathay Pacific airlines leaving Mumbai on 18th Oct (Saturday) and coming back from Beijing on 27th Oct (Monday). Below is the screenshot from the official website of the said airline showing the price to be INR 57,028 (USD 927.66).</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aUopL.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>But just out of curiosity i checked what the prices are for an earlier date and I selected the dates to be such that they are the same day as my intended days and with same number of total days i.e leaving Mumbai on 4th Oct (Saturday) and coming back on 13 Oct (Monday). I was thinking that surely this would be at least the same price if not higher and to my surprise the price was significantly lower, it was INR 44,314 (USD 720.85) as seen in the screenshot below.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1uZww.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I had always heard that in general the prices go up as the dates approach your travel date. Off-course there could be fluctuations in the price but you wouldn't expect to see the kind of drop seen above considering that 4th October is tomorrow.</p>  <p>So can I extrapolate this data and assume that on 17th Oct (Friday) the probability that the price for my intended ticket would be around INR 44,314 is higher than the probability that it would be around INR 57,028.</p>  <p>I understand that it would be risky and maybe silly to make such an assumption considering that there are many variables involved in the equation which determines airline price but what would you do? Seeing this data would you wait till the end or just book it right now?</p>  <p>I don't travel international much so maybe its not that unusual to see this kind of drop in prices.</p>  <p><em>FYI: both the screenshots were taken at  08:55 GMT on Friday, October 3, 2014</em>  </p> 
22114	Boarding a train in India at another station	<p>I have booked a ticket on a train from Mumbai to Chennai and boarding at Pune. Since my schedules have changed, I will be in Mumbai on that day. Can I board the same train in Mumbai in my own ticket and claim the seat/berth?</p> 
23127	With an Advanced Purchase UK train ticket, what happens if your train is cancelled?	<p>There are broadly three different kinds of <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types.aspx#which" rel="nofollow">UK train ticket available</a>, Anytime (valid on any train), Off-Peak / Super Off-Peak (valid on trains outside of peak hours), and Advanced Purchase (valid on only a specific train).</p>  <p>If you're on an Anytime ticket, if your train is cancelled, you just get any other one, and possibly <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/trains+uk+delays">claim for compensation</a> if it's long enough. For off peak ones, you take any other off peak train, or any train if they're feeling kind and waive the time restrictions.</p>  <p>However, Advanced Purchase tickets are valid only on the specific booked train, which is specified on the ticket, and aren't refundable or cancellable. What happens then if the train your Advanced Purchase ticket specifies you must travel on is cancelled?</p> 
14725	VWP - Can I leave the US and go to Paris and return back to the USA?	<p>I'm going to be traveling to the United States to visit family.

23251	How useful is a car to visit San Francisco?	<p>I'm travelling to SF in February and would like to hire a car at some point to drive out-with the city, however I'll be staying in a hotel in the middle of the city and the hotel change $30 a night to valet park the car.</p>  <p>How easy is it to get around SF without a car? and ho easy is it to get parked in the city?</p>  <p>TLDR: Is it worth hiring a car for my week long journey, or should I just hire on on the days I'm likely to need it?</p> 
24331	San Francisco to Los Angeles: bus or plane?	<p>Coming from Europe, I have been living in San Francisco for a month, and this is my first visit to America. In two months, I will have to go to Los Angeles for a meeting.</p>  <p>Obviously, taking the plane from SFO to LAX would be the fastest solution. As <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8871/cheapest-way-to-go-from-san-francisco-to-los-angeles">this question</a> says, taking a bus would be cheaper.</p>  <p>But are there other advantages of taking the bus, for someone discovering the country? For example, is there nice scenery to observe from the bus or such things?</p>

11683	Can I travel to Kuwait on a visa with old passport number?	<p>I have a Kuwait visa, obtained from a hotel in Kuwait, with my old passport number.

37342	Options to/from from Newark (NJ) airport and Penn Station (NY) at 6pm and 10am	<p>I am flying into Newark airport (NJ) on Tuesday and should arrive about 5:45pm. I will need to get to a hotel that is pretty close (5 min walk) to Penn Station. What is the best/easiest way to travel from the Newark Airport to the Penn Station vicinity at that time of day.</p>  <p>Two days later, when the conference is over, I'll need to travel back to the airport as well. My flight departs at 11:45am, so I should be to the airport no later than 10:15am.  If there is any reason I should use a different method of transportation at this time of day, please let me know.</p>  <p>I have done some basic research and know that the options are generally a taxi and public transportation.  I think I'd like to avoid the taxi due to traffic &amp; cost.  But there are so many options with public transportation that it's confusing. </p>  <p>I thought the NYC Airport Shuttle might be a good idea:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.nycairporter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nycairporter.com/</a></p>  <p>But then I looked up the Yelp reviews and decided against it.  One of the Yelp reviews recommended the AirTrain:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.panynj.gov/airports/ewr-to-from.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.panynj.gov/airports/ewr-to-from.html</a></p>  <p>which seems like it would get me to Penn Station (which is my goal) with a train transfer.  However, the "transfer" part makes me hesitate a bit, I'm not sure what to expect with that.</p>  <p>So, what I'm really looking for is someone who has experience traveling in New York, with these various methods, and can speak from experience about the best mode of travel to/from the locations described at the times described.</p>  <p>I will only have my backpack, no other luggage, which I understand might influence the decision.</p>  <p>I'm asking ahead of time because I've always lived in areas of the country where traffic was minimal and we drive almost everywhere we go.  So, having to rely on public transportation is new experience for me and I'd like to have a plan in place and know what to expect.</p>

37334	Best way to get from Laguardia to Penn Station at 10:30pm (and back)?	<p>I am flying into Laguardia airport (NY) and should arrive about 10:15pm.  I will need to get to a hotel that is pretty close (5 min walk) to Penn Station.  What are my options to do that?</p>  <p>Conversely, I'll need to travel back to the airport the next day.  My flight departs at 7:00pm, so I should be to the airport no later than 5:30, but preferably closer to five.  I'm coming in for a conference that doesn't get over until five.  I would like to leave as late as possible for the airport but not miss the flight.  Given it will be rush hour, what are my options here?</p> 
37103	If I don't declare a not-yet-used engagement ring at airport security, am I smuggling jewelry?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/37054/how-do-i-get-an-engagement-ring-past-security-customs-in-an-airport-without-aler">How do I get an engagement ring past security/customs in an airport without alerting my significant other?</a>, MikeV posted a pertinent question which is worth asking:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If I buy a ring in the US, put it in my bag and do not declare the ring I am smuggling jewelry? How is that different from buying the ring, wearing it round my neck on a chain (or on my own finger for that matter) and not declaring it? Am I supposed to declare my own jewelry that I already paid for (including taxes upon purchase)?</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, what is the verdict on this? smuggling or not? And is it a difference whether it's on a finger, on a neck chain, or in a box in the carry-on?</p> 
27225	How do I decide whether to be worried about having enough blank pages in my passport?	<p>I am planning a long trip over a year from now. The tentative itinerary is</p>  <ul> <li>Canada</li> <li>USA (maybe LA, maybe Hawaii, doesn't matter, I have Nexus)</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>New Caledonia</li> <li>Vanuatu</li> <li>Fiji</li> <li>Samoa</li> <li>New Zealand</li> <li>Cook Islands</li> <li>Tahiti</li> <li>Easter Island</li> <li>Chile (or possibly back to places we have been before)</li> <li>Canada</li> </ul>  <p>I will be traveling on a Canadian passport. All of these countries are (for me) "you can stay 30 days without a visa" or "visa on arrival" except for Australia, which is an electronic visa. </p>  <p>In my past travels, some countries have been pretty good about fitting 4 stamps on a page (eg Bulgaria stamped on the way in and out, but they chose the page that the Netherlands had used for in and out.) However not all have been. Australia put their entry stamp on an otherwise empty page and then found a different empty page for the exit stamp. </p>  <p>I have three blank single pages scattered among the stamped-on pages, and then a stretch of 12 single blank pages running to the end. My passport is one-third full, then, and I have almost 3 years left on it. But I am a little worried this trip will fill it up. If each of the 10 not-Canada, not-US places consumes one page for the entry stamp and one for the exit, I will not have enough pages. But if they're more like Bulgaria was, I'm fine. Further, if travel from New Zealand to the Cook Islands and from Easter Island to Chile is considered domestic, there may not even be stamping involved for those legs.</p>  <p>It is not possible to add more pages to a Canadian passport. It is not normally permitted to renew less than a year before it expires, though you can request it and you need a good reason. "My passport is full" is a good reason. I don't know if "I have calculated my passport will be close to full" is a good reason or not. Further, I don't intend to spend long enough in any place to allow for the time it would take to renew my full passport and continue along my journey, should it become full along the way.</p>  <p>Bottom line: not just "should I be worried?" but "how can I tell whether to be worried or not?" Some specific subquestions:</p>  <ul> <li>is there a way to tell whether a given country uses a 1/4 page standard size stamp, or glues a piece of paper into the passport, and the size of that piece of paper?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance which countries use exit stamps?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance whether trips between countries that belong to each other are domestic (eg LA to Hawaii will not generate anyone a stamp) or not - thinking of the Cook Islands and Easter Island for me, but generally applicable</li> <li>any specific advice about wildly early renewal of a Canadian passport would also be good</li> </ul> 
2939	What can I do to prevent passport stamps being put on blank pages?	<p>I'm running low on blank passport pages which are sometimes needed for full page visas such as those issued by Armenia, India, and Vietnam.</p>  <p>When I crossed the border into Turkey the other day I got my visa-on-arrival and stamp, but instead of putting it on a partly used page, which I have many, the guy at customs and immigration put them on a previously blank page. Now I have one fewer!</p>  <p><strong>What can I do to prevent or at least reduce the chances of this happening?</strong></p>  <p>It's worth remembering that there's likely to be a language barrier and it's always best to be ultra-nice to these border officials.</p>  <p>Has anybody heard of any trick such as sticking bit of paper in your passport, either blank, or looking a bit like visas? I have noticed that nobody ever stamps a page that has a remnant of something once stapled in there in Japan. There is a kind of stub that had its major part torn off along a perforation. Might I be able to emulate this somehow or would that even be worse making the blank pages invalid for full page visas due to having holes from staples? I know some things can get very picky when it comes to customs and immigration.</p> 
7943	Why is there a 'secret carrier' option for a flight?	<p>When searching for a flight on <a href="http://www.kayak.com/#/flights/MIA-HKG/2012-06-30-flexible-1day/2012-07-12-flexible-1day/business">kayak.com</a> (not for me, I don't fly business), it shows a "Secret Carrier" option.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RoIEK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>What gives? Why are they unable to tell us even the code-share partner? What if you want to use miles? How does the travel agent know who they're booking with?</p> 
21347	Why do hotel booking sites ask for the number of people? Does it matter how many I say?	<p>I was planning a stay at a hotel in Chicago for an overnight layover and checking prices on the hotel's booking site (in this case the Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport) for a room with 2 double beds. The site asks for the number of people in my party. In my case there will be 3 adults, no kids.</p>  <p>I experimented with different answers to the # of adults question and found that 1-2 people sharing a room gave a price of $94, for 3 people it was $118, and 4 people raised it to $142. </p>  <p>I don't get the extra charge since it will be the exact same room in all of those situations. Do most hotels do this? If I just book the room specifying 2 people and bring a 3rd is there any risk involved? </p>  <p>I'd also like to hear any insight from hotel insiders about what is behind the logic of charging different rates for the same room depending on how many people will be in it (assuming you don't need an extra roll-away bed). It would make sense if there was a free breakfast or something, but this hotel doesn't offer that.</p> 
30736	Can I travel to Croatia with single-entry Schengen visa?	<p>I am traveling to Zurich with a single-entry Schengen visa.</p>  <p>While coming back can I travel to Croatia for 3 days and then return to India (Country of Origin)?</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
34997	Visiting Romania with a type D visa for Germany	<p>I have a Schengen visa type D for 134 days, can I visit Romania for a short stay (like 4 days)? I have reserved my ticket from Bucharest to Germany.</p> 
31306	Why does a passport have a place of birth field on it?	<p>Almost all passports I have seen have a place of birth field on them. For instance, on the Indian Passport,</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/51Jbel.jpg" alt="Random Samaritan Indian Passport"></p>  <p>and on the US Passport,</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mldwnl.jpg" alt="Random Samaritan US Passport"></p>  <p>Is there a specific reason to this?</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
14269	How far in advance is it recommended to book flight tickets?	<p>Ok so I know that rule of thumb for booking flight tickets is 'earlier the better' but I am not sure how far in advance should the action be taken. I have seen many cases where the min. prices at say 4 months before travel dates are higher than 3 months before, this I believe is primarily due to a new flight route being added or some complex airline thingy beyond me but this almost always happens. Also let me know if this is common or I am mistaken here.</p>  <p>So I am asking what is the time line that I should draw untill I look for better deals and book the flight eventually. I have to travel in last week June and return around 1 week Aug, I am open to changes in travel dates by 1 week in both direction and both ways.</p> 
35468	When to buy plane tickets to get best rates?	<p>I'm planning a trip from Europe to USA, that will happen next summer.</p>  <p>I was looking lately into purchasing plane tickets, but a lot of carriers do not offer late July/early August 2015 tickets <em>yet</em>.</p>  <p>So, I can buy some ticket on kayak.com, but I feel that if I'll wait a bit, I might get a better deal. My question is generally - when is the best moment to purchase tickets - one that gives best prices, but also doesn't limit available flights too much, so I have options to choose from.</p> 
21783	Do I need a transit visa in Zurich on the way to India?	<p>I am travelling from US to India, with an Indian passport but expired F1 visa and going there to get my H1B visa stamping. I have a stop at Zurich for 2 hours while flying to India. Do I need a transit visa for my trip? </p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
37439	Why are airlines against the transferring of tickets to other persons?	<p>Airlines usually either don't allow the transferring of tickets to another person after they've been purchased, or they do it at an extremely inflated price. What is the reason for doing this?</p>  <p>One idea I came up with would be to allow authorities to do background checks, but one could buy a ticket at the airport shortly before the flight. Of course, it would be more expensive and there would be the risk of a fully booked plane, but it is not impossible.</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p>

13464	What harm can be done with a copy of one's passport?	<p>In one of the questions on this site, it was suggested the use of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/6602/141">Dropbox</a> to save a backup copy of your passport, in case you need to proof who you are if your original document is lost. </p>  <p>I like the idea, but what if someone gets access to your Dropbox folders and is able to acquire the copy of your passport.  The same goes for when you leave a copy of your passport at a hotel receptions desk. Once someone has the info printed on that copy, would that make it easier to steal your identity?</p>

21005	What is the difference between customs and immigration?	<p>Maybe this is a question that should be asked at <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com">english.se</a> in stead. I am just wondering if you can talk about "going through customs", when referring to all processes involved in entering/transferring a country.

Sometimes airlines will charge far more for tickets to that do not include a Saturday night stay, on the assumption that those passengers are business travelers who aren’t flexible and can afford to pay more.

4213	Last minute flight bookings - better to book online or at the airport?	<p>We had <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2952/108">a question here earlier on booking flight tickets in the weeks running up to holiday season</a>, which covered ground on what happens to flight prices over the period.</p>  <p>What I'm interested to know is if I had to fly out at short notice, say within 1-2 days, then am I better off booking within that 1-2 day gap online, or am I better off trying my luck directly at the airport (as long as I'm willing to wait at the airport) for a cheaper price? Is there any truth to rumours that airlines sell tickets at cheaper prices at the airport right before flights to fill empty seats or is that a myth?</p> 
3356	How big is "too big" for an airline seat? At what point will you be required to buy two tickets?	<p>As I said in another question, I'm bringing my parents to visit me here in Sweden next year.</p>  <p>My mother is around 280-300 pounds and 5'6" (130-135kg, 1.67m). I am concerned that she might be asked at the airport to buy a second seat. If it's likely I would rather just buy the second seat in advance, because I don't want her to be embarassed/humiliated by some random employee. As well, I won't be there, they will be travelling alone and aren't used to dealing with airports and they won't know what their rights are.</p>  <p>In terms of how it will affect other passengers, it's not important, she will get a window seat and my dad will sit in the middle seat, so I don't see it affecting anybody. </p>  <p>She insists it's fine, "the last time I flew I fit easily!" but that was 20 years ago when she was half the size. </p>  <p>They will be flying BA or SAS, definitely not Ryanair.</p>  <p>So - where is the cutoff? Is a 300 pound 5'6" woman going to be too big to fit in a single airline seat? Or am I worrying about nothing?</p> 
3363	Laptop Searches by Customs - UK and US	<p>I'll be traveling to the UK (London) on a study abroad in the spring and will be bring my laptop for school and intern purposes.  I was just curious what/if any rights UK customs has to search laptops at the border, and how common laptop seizure and search is when returning to the good old U.S.A.</p> 
24319	Laptop/mobile device in countries with Sharia	<p>I'm traveling to Iran and i need to bring my laptop. </p>  <p>For western standards I do not have anything illegal on my hard drive but since I'm not familiar with the Sharia I'm a little bit paranoid.</p>  <ol> <li>Is it dangerous to have, for example, holiday pictures of girls in bikinis or similar on your laptop? Is it common that laptops get searched or am I just paranoid?</li> <li>If that is dangerous, how should I proceed? I need to take my laptop with me. Should I encrypt everything? Given the fact that browsing the internet already caches maybe dangerous pictures and it is very hard to be sure that one has deleted all of them, how should I clean my laptop?</li> </ol> 
26949	Have anyone experienced inspection of their laptop or digital media content?	<p>There is <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3363/laptop-searches-by-customs-uk-and-us?lq=1">a question</a> about the UK and the US and whether their border officers can search your laptop.

7254	US and Canada Border Crossing and Computer Privacy: What do I need to know?	<p>I've read stories about border officials searching laptops when crossing the border in one direction or the other. Does this really happen, typically speaking?</p>  <p>As a US citizen, can I be forced to give them my laptop's password for any/no reason? I don't believe they are allowed to deny entry to the US to a US citizen? ....but who knows these days?</p>  <p>Canada can deny me entry for any reason, so that's fine. But in practice, does this even happen in either crossing direction?</p>  <p>EDIT - I've now made the trip. They didn't so much as glance in the direction of my laptop. My biggest issue turned out to be lack of international wireless data service!</p> 
36203	Schengen visa: Must I enter and leave the Schengen area in the same country?	<p>I live in London and  am planning to visit France and Brussels. I'm applying in French embassy, showing hotel booking in France and I will stay there three nights and 4th day morning I will travel to Brussels and will leave Brussels around evening. </p>  <p>Do I need to go back to Paris for coming back to London or can I directly a take train from Brussels to London?  Also do I need to show (to the embassy) a ticket for traveling to Brussels from Paris?</p> 
4043	From San Francisco airport to the South Bay by public transit	<p>I'll be landing at San Francisco International Airport, and my final destination is Silicon Valley. To be precise, I want to get to the VTA light rail line from Mountain View, but more general advice regarding destinations south of the airport would be welcome. How can I get there by public transport in a reasonable time?</p>  <p>I see that many different carriers may be involved (BART, Caltrain, Samtrans, VTA, …). I won't have Internet access during the journey, so any decision regarding routes will have to be made based on posted schedules. Ideally, I'd like a recommendation of one route that won't make me wait too long if I just miss a bus or train. Also, I may have a limited supply of coins for buses that require exact fare.</p>

37472	Is New Dehli, India, safe to travel to? (Ebola Scare)	<p>I'm a fairly paranoid traveler. I'm in Chennai at the moment, but I can't wait to get back home to Los Angeles. Because of the general lack of hygiene here and, well, the way they handle things like food, I do not want to be in India at all.</p>  <p>I've been reading that New Delhi has the most West African expats in the country.

37127	Minimum available passport blank page requirements	<p>For a British Citizen travelling on business to one country for up to 30 days what are the maximum numbers of consecutive and not-necessarily-consecutive minimum blank pages required in a passport when applying for a single-entry visa <strike>and which country (or countries) imposes them</strike>? </p>  <p>An answer which is just two numbers (presumably each a single digit) would be adequate. </p>  <hr>  <p>Small (eg Maldives) island nations may be ignored.<br> Where custom and practice departs from regulations (eg SA) it is the former that is more my interest.<br> I see a Canadian heard mention of a need for six blank pages.<br> Three for each seems more plausible, but I have not found which countries stipulate that, if any.<br> I recognise that what is correct today may be out-of-date tomorrow.</p>

22690	Would China to Taiwan and back again count as another entry into China?	<p>I have a double entry visa for China. I've used up the first one and will reenter China for the second one in the next few days.</p>  <p>Now I'd really like to go to Taiwan by ferry but was worried that it would use up my last entry into China and I'd then have to fly out of Taiwan.</p>  <p>But then I started thinking that since China doesn't recognize Taiwan that from their point of view I would not be leaving China, so it should not use up an entry, so I could return and continue travelling in China.</p>  <p>But since the China/Taiwan situation is pretty special and unique there could also be special rules about it.</p>

26828	How can I buy an economy ticket one-way from Tahiti to Easter Island?	<p>I am trying to price flights for a South Pacific trip. Easter Island can be reached from either Santiago, Chile, or Tahiti. Flights from island to island within the South Pacific (eg Fiji to Samoa or New Caledonia to Vanuatu) tend to run about 300 per person. Some are a little less, some a little more. But PPT-IPC is $1300 per person, no matter where I look. Expedia, Travelocity, Cheapo Air, Matrix by ITA, LAN's own site, you name it. And when I look a little closer, this prices is, it turns out, almost always for a business class ticket. For example from ITA:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LvVQU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Is this an all-business flight? Why can't I find economy prices on this route?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> This seems to be related to its being one way. Return tickets are hard to find because there is only 1 flight a week in each direction. But for example on LAN if I choose return PPT-IPC March 10th, IPC-PPT March 16th, I can get $750 per person in O class. If I could throw away the return I would save over $500 per person, but what I would prefer is to buy the O class one way - especially since I don't intend to move to Easter Island, so I will be leaving it, and I will be leaving it on a LAN flight, so annoying them with dropped segments is a bad idea.</p> 
798	In the US, what's a good prepaid GSM SIM card without a phone?	<p>My daughter is going to spend the next school year (August 2011 to June 2012) in Memphis, TN as an exchange student from Switzerland. She'd very much like to use her iPhone during her stay in the United States.</p>  <p>What are her options for getting prepaid talk, text and data services without also having to buy a new phone? I realize that she'll be limited to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile because of the GSM network.</p>  <p>As far as I've read, T-Mobile SIM cards only work on T-Mobile branded phones, so is AT&amp;T her only option there?</p> 
37193	British Passenger with less than 2 months valid passport transiting in Dubai and leaving through Abu Dhabi next day	<p>I am a British citizen but my passport is expiring two months from Today. I will travel to the UK via UAE. My flight to the UAE is through Dubai but my connecting flight to London is Etihad Airways which leaves only from Abu Dhabi 24 hours later.

British Citizens are normally given visas on arrival at the airport but due to the 2 months validity on the passport I am a bit worried. Can anyone please advice if that is Ok.</p> 
27650	What to do if you need to fly in the Schengen area and lose your ID card?	<p>A friend recently got her ID stolen while she was in the Netherlands. She will soon need to fly to her home country Italy, but she doesn't know what to do.</p>  <p>What can one do in such a situation? As far as I know, since it's Schengen, you don't need an ID card to go through borders. On the other hand, this is air travel, so they always require it for security reasons. </p>  <p>Can she show another document that proves her nationality? A copy of the ID card? Anything?</p> 
29149	Is a passport needed for traveling by plane in Mexico? (Non-international flight)	<p>I am going to be driving into Tijuana to board a flight that will take me to Acapulco. My flight is from Tijuana to Acapulco. Both locations are in Mexico. Will I need to have a passport in order to attend the flight, even though the flight is from one place in Mexico to another? I heard that in this situation, a passport is not required, but a passport may be required upon reentering the US. Would other documents be sufficient for boarding this flight? I will be returning from Acapulco to Tijuana, and from there I will be driving back across the border to the U.S. </p>

20252	Are there subcategories of seats even within economy class?	<p>Recently I had to travel by Singapore Airlines (Economy class). But when I tried to change the return date of my ticket, customer care office informed me that there are no more seats in my class for the expected date. They ask me to pay some extra few dollars to book the seat on the day I need. Then I  asked him what is the new class my seat is under. He said it is also Economy class. I was surprised, he explained me a long description. But as summary I understood, there are inner categories of seats inside economy class and, air ticket price change according to particular category.</p>  <p>Is this true or are they cheating me to get few more dollars?</p>

Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
788	How can I travel to Germany with my dog?	<p>I will be traveling to Germany (from the USA) in a few months and hope to bring my dog, a 10 lb Chihuahua-mix.  I would like to do this with a minimum of difficulty, so I am hoping to hear the experiences of others who have done this in order to avoid any pitfalls.</p>  <p>My understanding is that it is necessary to have the dog microchipped and then re-vaccinated against rabies, and have the vet sign a form giving the microchip number and details of the vaccination.  (There is a handy <a href="http://www.zoll.de/english_version/faq/a0_passenger_traffic/d0_pets/index.html">FAQ from the German customs authority</a> which gives the general picture.)</p>  <ul> <li>How long before travel do I need to have the rabies vaccine and microchip done?</li> <li><strong>Is the signature of my vet sufficiently "official"?</strong>  Some other website mentioned getting an approval from the USDA.</li> <li><strong>Is a particular kind of microchip required or recommended?</strong>  I know there are several different microchip systems.</li> <li>Are there any other particular pitfalls to avoid?  For instance, I assume I will have to avoid traveling via Ireland or the UK to get there.</li> </ul> 
16031	Tourism on Schengen business visa (circulation)	<p>I am an Indian citizen living in UK on a tier 2 visa. Recently, I have received Short stay Schengen visas (multiple entry, business trips for 1 year) for travelling to France.

My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
27672	Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don't want to stay in Greece at all?	<p>I want to travel to Spain however the requirements state that my UK residence permit be valid for 3 months after intended date of departure from the Schengen area. I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p> 
30679	Use of unused Schengen visa to travel to Switzerland	<p>I am Indian national residing in UK and have been issued Schengen visa by Norway Embassy which is Type 'C', multiple entry and expires on 21st oct 2014.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have never used this visa to travel to any country in Europe.</p>  <p>My question is whether I use this Schengen visa issued by Norwegian Embassy to travel to Switzerland for a 10 day holiday?</p>  <p>My first port of entry will be Geneva airport.</p>  <p>Please let me know if I can use this visa and if I need to carry some additional documents to clear immigration control when I land in Switzerland.</p> 
36375	What do I lose by not booking flights through a travel agent?	<p>I take quite a lot of flights for both business and pleasure, and although I typically book my business flights through a (corporate-mandated) travel agent, I always book my personal flights directly with the airline (I should add that I am fussy, and I normally fly only with full-service airlines; no budget ones for me).</p>  <p>From time to time, I read that booking flights through a travel agent, either online or physical, can lead to cheaper prices. At least for simple trips (one airline, maybe a simple return), I have a hard time believing this to be the case; the airline has most direct control over their tickets, travel agents add a layer of extra indirection that has to be paid for, etc.</p>  <p>So am I losing anything by not booking with a travel agent? Am I really likely to get better prices?</p>  <p><em>Edit</em>: I should be clearer - let me restrict the scenario by imagining that I already know what I want - e.g. to get from LHR to ORD on date X/Y/Z, with no stops, ideally on American Airlines. Can a travel agent still offer me something in that scenario?</p> 
37439	Why are airlines against the transferring of tickets to other persons?	<p>Airlines usually either don't allow the transferring of tickets to another person after they've been purchased, or they do it at an extremely inflated price. What is the reason for doing this?</p>  <p>One idea I came up with would be to allow authorities to do background checks, but one could buy a ticket at the airport shortly before the flight. Of course, it would be more expensive and there would be the risk of a fully booked plane, but it is not impossible.</p>

When that expires, I hope to move to another European country, and continue this pattern of moving countries for as long as I'm eligible for visas.</p>  <p>I know that without a visa, as an Australian I can only stay in the Schengen area for 90 days out of every 180.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Is it going to be fine to apply for a Schengen visa (probably another 1-year working holiday) visa for another country, immediately consecutive to my current visa - i.e. starting the day my current one ends?</p></li> <li><p>When my visa here expires, do I need to leave the country immediately, or can I stay for up to 90 days before leaving?</p></li> </ul> 
22299	Dubai (UAE) visa requirements when staying in the airport for a French citizen?	<p>I have read that, at the time of writing (2013), UAE visas are:</p>  <ol> <li>96-Hour : Valid for passengers in transit</li> <li>Tourist : Maximum 30 days</li> <li>Visit   : Maximum 90 days</li> </ol>  <p>But I am only connecting flights, so I am staying in the airport.

9204	Is there an easy way to calculate the total cost of tolls for a trip within the United States?	<p>Is there a convenient way to calculate the cost of tolls between two arbitrary points within the United States? I'm planning to take a trip along the Eastern seaboard and will be passing through multiple states with different toll-collecting authorities. The mapping and trip planning resources I've found so far will only indicate whether a particular section of road has tolls, not the price of those tolls. I'm aware that the various toll-collecting authorities post their rates online, but these charts are often difficult to use if you're not already familiar with the area. Isn't there an easier way?</p> 
5167	Any travel booking sites that let you search for a mixed itinerary?	<p>Travel sites that search all the major air lines are a dime a dozen.  And in some localities, there are travel sites that at least pay lip service to searching major bus carriers.</p>  <p>But are there any travel sites that will search all major forms of transportation, and let you form a mixed itinerary? I'm thinking at least air, bus, and train.</p>  <p>For instance, if I want the cheapest way to get from Town A to Town B, I'd like options like:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Take Foo Bus Line from Town A to City Q</li>   <li>Fly Bar Airline from City Q to City Z</li>   <li>Take Baz Passenger Train from City Z to Town B</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>For bonus points, it might even include public transit options, in localities where it's actually feasible to take public transit between major cities.</p> 
27485	Can I use Google Maps traffic information to estimate driving time for a specific date/time?	<p>In supported regions, Google Maps will tell me how long it will take to drive from A to B in current traffic conditions.  It can also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/25817/will-the-traffic-and-parking-be-easier-in-york-on-a-week-day-or-a-weekend/">colour-code roads according to traffic conditions for a specific date and time of the week</a>.  However, is it possible to estimate driving time for a specific date and time of the week?</p>  <p>(For a (long) weekend trip, I'm estimating whether it's worth to take the train from Toronto to Barrie and rent a car from there, as opposed to renting a car from Toronto)</p> 
7043	Do I have to enter the UK on my UK passport?	<p>I'm a British National (Overseas), which basically means that while I don't have the right of abode in the UK, I am permitted to visit the UK without a visa. However, my passport has expired, and while it's being renewed, the schedule is a bit tight.</p>  <p>At the same time, I'm an US Citizen, and since I'm only planning to visit the UK, I don't need a visa if I enter on my US passport.</p>  <p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p>

30451	Is 2h 45m enough for a layover in EWR transferring from an int'l to a domestic flight (Terminal B → Terminal C)?	<p>I am arriving from Frankfurt(FRA) to Newark(EWR) and I must pass the Customs and Border Control before catching the next flight to Baltimore (BWI). Both flight are on the same ticket by United Airlines (UA51 and UA4775)</p>  <ol> <li>Is 2 hours and 45 minutes enough time to catch the next plane, or do I have to expect longer waiting times and should go for a different route?</li> <li>I'll be traveling before the AirTrain starts operating.

29000	How to get from Flores to Lombok by sea with stops?	<p>Next August I'll be traveling with some friends in Indonesia (4 to 6 people). One of our destinations is Labuan Bajo (Flores island). We want to visit Komodo National Park and some islands in our route from Flores to Gili islands or Lombok. We have found that there is a company that has a small cruise (2 nights/2 days) that does <a href="http://www.peramatour.com/47-Sea%20Adventure-Hunting-Komodo-by-Camera-02-2N-2D.html" rel="nofollow">exactly this</a>. The problem with that is the price (a bit high), the restricted schedule (you may be stuck in Luang Bajo for 3 or 4 days) and the crowds (I've read that the boat is full of tourists in high season). </p>  <p>Given this, I'd like to ask if it's possible to hire a ship, boat or similar when we arrive to Labuan Bajo and make this trip on our own. Something similar but as a private tour and if that's possible, what's a good price for this?</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
38004	How can I bring a broken tablet on an airplane to the US?	<p>Earlier this year when in America I bought a Nexus 7 tablet and brought it with me to Argentina. The tablet stopped working shortly after arrival and nothing I tried to do made it work. By chance I'm flying again to the US, where I'll be able to give the tablet back under warranty. However, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/6/5875449/tsa-blocking-uncharged-mobile-devices-from-flights-at-some">the TSA doesn't seem to allow you to bring uncharged or not working electronics on some flights</a>.</p>  <p>Does this restriction apply to the carry-on luggage of all international flights? Is there anywhere I can check this?</p>  <p>If so, does the TSA let you bring electronics in the checked-in baggage?  </p>  <p>Passing electronics and other expensive things through the Argentine border is nearly guaranteed to get them stolen, but this may be the only way to bring it to the United States.</p> 
38003	Claim for Lost and then found baggage	<p>I am in a tricky situation. In an emergency flight, a middle-eastern airline lost my one baggage. After 21 days as their policy- they asked me to submit the documents to claim it. They were supposed to reimburse me within next 21 days. That did not happen. Now they have found the baggage at a third airport, 1 month after filing the claim. I have not yet been contacted by them to collect it though, probably they are arranging it.</p>  <p>What should I do here? What and how I can claim? My baggage contained mostly edible items, which surely have rotted in this two-month period. Furthermore, to collect all this stuff its lots of efforts and time given being an annual trip to home.</p> 
25263	UK Visa valid for next 5 months, can I apply for Schengen Visa?	<p>I have migrated from India to UK on a Short term ICT Tier 2 visa,</p>  <p>I want to visit Europe, and want to apply for Schengen Visa for the same. However, my UK Visa is valid only until August, i.e., 5 months. If I apply now, will my application be considered for schengen visa, or should I get my UK Visa renewed before applying for schengen visa?</p> 
17020	My Schengen visa and UK visa are valid until November, am I ok to travel in September/October?	<p>I am from China and my Schengen visa is valid until 2nd of November this year. My UK dependent visa will expire at the same time as well.</p>  <p>I am just wondering if I am allowed to travel 3 months before my UK visa expired?</p>  <p>I have seen lots of information online about Schengen visa application requirements and they all saying the applicant needs to have a valid UK visa for at least 3 months in order to apply for Schengen visa.  Is it the same for people who have already have a valid Schengen visa? I am not sure if that apply on my case too. Really hope I can get an answer to confirm this so that I can go ahead and book my journey. </p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
16266	Can I bring my desktop computer as check-in baggage on a flight?	<p>I am moving from Malaysia to the US, and planning to bring my desktop computer with me. I plan to pack it in my checked-in luggage. Will the computer risk being damaged? Any precaution should I take to reduce this risk? Will there be any trouble with the airline or immigration about bringing computer?</p> 
18478	Is it easy to get a visa for France if one already has a visa for the UK and applies from the UK?	<p>For a Russian citizen:</p>  <p>If I have a general purpose (6 months) visa for the UK, and am currently in the UK, does that make it easier to get a visa for France.</p>  <p>For example: I'm in the UK on the general purpose visa for a 3 month holiday, and I would like to visit Paris. So if I wander into the French embassy in London are they likely to give a French visa easily on the basis that I already jumped through all the hoops for the UK visa?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
12967	What is the best way to get ARS using USD?	<p>The current (official) exchange rate for USD to ARS is around 1:5, but I've heard that due to the fluctuation recently there may be a way to get a better value for USD in Argentina.</p>  <p>Any pointers?</p> 
18467	Are there well signed walking routes up the Seven Mountains in Bergen?	<p>According to the <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bergen#Geography">WikiVoyage page on Bergen</a>, <em>The city center is surrounded by a group of mountains and peaks known as the Seven Mountains</em>. I've <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bergen#Mount_Fl.C3.B8yen">read</a> that the most central of the mountains, Mount Fløyen, has both a funicular railway and well signed paths, so walking up that one should be fine.</p>  <p>What about the other of the seven mountains? Do they have well signed walking paths too? Or is the situation with those more like hiking most of the Munroe Mountains in Scotland, where you really need to buy the appropriate 1:25k hiking map?</p> 
14610	Is it possible for a foreigner to drive through (mainland) China in a foreign-registered car?	<p>Is it possible to drive through mainland China, for example for transit from Kazakhstan to Vietnam, as a non-Chinese citizen, in an own car/van/truck?</p>  <p>This is about an European Union citizen, trying to make a tourist trip overland by car from the EU to Vietnam. This is about a special (equipped with sleeping, cooking and other facilities) vehicle, that the owner intends to keep and use in Vietnam, so buying/renting a vehicle inside China and selling it before leaving is not an option - the question is about driving a specific vehicle the owner already has in the EU to Vietnam. getting new licence plates is OK, as long as it is allowed to put back the old ones when the vehicle gets back to the EU.</p>  <p>What legal issues are there with getting in an own car over China, and how to overcome them?</p>  <p>Is it possible to drive a car with EU licence plates through China, or would one have to get something like temporary Chinese plates? Is an EU driving licence valid? Are there any customs issues one has to know about, and how long one can keep a foreign motor vehicle in China without having to pay import taxes on it?</p> 
14209	Can you enter the departures area without a boarding pass at London Heathrow airport?	<p>My girlfriend is leaving the UK from Heathrow tomorrow. Is it possible for me to go through security with her so that we can be together until she goes to her departure gate?</p> 
37006	Got a Schengen visa that's too short for my trip, can I stay one more day?	<p>My friends and O will be travelling in Paris for 15 days and in 6 days in Barcelona. We applied for our visa and got a 1 month visa. But we can only stay for 20 days on it. Even though we planned a 21 day stay. Will this be an issue? We leave in two days so we cannot even give it for extension. How should we proceed? </p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
21544	Open Banking account in the US for a foreign traveler	<p>I am travelling to the US on vacation.

10590	Lost passport with Schengen visa	<p>My passport was stolen in Prague on my way to Vienna. I filed a police report and our embassy swiftly acted by giving me a temporary passport for my onward journey to Munich and Rome. Upon exit from Rome, the immigration ask for the Schengen visa, when I told him that I lost my passport, he did not ask for any document to support my claim, he just stamped my new passport with exit. I am not sure if on record, I am officially out of the Schengen area or not. I am scared that without the lost visa, it appears that I am still in the area and might reach the 90 day limit and will be denied when I re-apply as it would appear I broke the rule. What to do?</p> 
36168	Does a US Citizen need a visa to enter as a tourist to the UK for 6 months?	<p>Everything I've seen points to no (and I would love that to be true since applying for a visa online costs money) but I'm worried about getting refused due to the length of time I wish to stay, which is 6 months.</p>  <p>I went to university in the UK on a Tier 4 visa, but have never just been a tourist which is what I would like to do now. Since graduating, I have started working but am underwhelmed and would love to travel again. My original plan was Australia but now I would like to see the rest of the UK as well beforehand.</p>  <p>If I arrived with the following, would I be refused entry simply for not applying online?: an approved Australian work &amp; holiday visa, a mini itinerary, bank statements for the last 6 months.</p>

When talking about how many items (electronics, jewelry, perfumes, watches etc) we can take in luggage bags and/or cabin bags there is always confusion. Some people say you can't take more than two phones or at most four electronic items. Some other mention different numbers. I was never terrified with numbers until I came to this situation. </p>  <p>Can anybody provide me with an official link stating the amount of items I can bring to India?

If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?

This is implied on at least <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/practical-information/money-costs">one website</a> however there's no indication that you can withdraw more while in the country, as on the same link it indicates that ATMs there only work with local cards, so it's unclear how you're meant to get more money once you're there.</p>

21692	Travelling without a visa after passport was stolen	<p>I am a student on a short term Schengen visa in Belgium. Recently, my passport was stolen after which I got a new passport issued by the Indian embassy. This obviously does not have a Schengen visa (that was on the stolen passport).

I filed a police report and our embassy swiftly acted by giving me a temporary passport for my onward journey to Munich and Rome. Upon exit from Rome, the immigration ask for the Schengen visa, when I told him that I lost my passport, he did not ask for any document to support my claim, he just stamped my new passport with exit. I am not sure if on record, I am officially out of the Schengen area or not. I am scared that without the lost visa, it appears that I am still in the area and might reach the 90 day limit and will be denied when I re-apply as it would appear I broke the rule. What to do?</p> 
30471	Advice for flying with a 6 month old infant?	<p>We are going to have our first flight with our 6 month-old child. The flight will be 12 hours long.</p>  <p>Is there anything we need to pay special attention to? Anything we might overlook?</p>  <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>  <p>Ok, so we just came back from our holidays. The tips given here were really helpful.  However, we found out our child was afraid of the dark : since it was a night flight, they dim the lights during take-off. Unfortunately, we found that out when they put the lights back on, when we reached the cruising altitude. Apart from that, all went fine.</p>

38274	Do airline pricing systems use "tickles" as data?	<p>Of course, airline "pricers" (humans or now computer) use every sale to decide and determine what the price for a flight is going to be on a given day, as the flight approaches.</p>  <p>I'm curious whether MERELY SEARCHING on a flight (whether on the airline.com or expedia/etc) is actually USED AS DATA in this process.</p>  <p>So for example, it might be that merely checking an obscure flight on expedia - but not securing it - means that wen you try later than afternoon the price goes up.</p>  <p>Example of this in a similar industry: depressingly regarding buying domain names, mere tickles actually trigger systems where bastard domain companies watch for certain patterns and buy them up so they can resell.</p>  <p>We have not worked on airline systems for some time so I have no clue.

It is multi-entry type valid for 18 months (90 day stay), I used this visa to visit the EU last month and it will remain valid till January 2015.</p>  <p>My question is can I cancel this visa?

16581	Does browsing ticket sites in incognito mode and/or from different IP's result in cheaper ticket prices?	<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1caomf/what_are_some_useful_secrets_from_your_job_that/c9es3w2">a discussion</a> yesterday where industry insiders share tips relating to their respective fields. Someone who works in e-commerce stated :</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"When purchasing items on the internet (especially airline tickets),   use incognito mode on your browser. We use your own cookies against   you: raising the price on tickets the more times you check, as you   shop around for better deals. That way you'll think the price is going   up or that seats are being actively sold - thus increasing your   urgency to buy, and punishing you for trying to get a good deal."</p> </blockquote>  <p>and </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"The point is that it's not enough to just shop around to different   websites on your own computer anymore. You have to shop around with a   clean browser, different browsers, different computers, change of IP,   maybe try from work then RDP to your home computer or somebody on the   other side of the country, etc. Also, always call the airline directly   and check on the price - sometimes it's much cheaper."</p> </blockquote>  <p>Do these tactics indeed work when purchasing tickets online?</p>

24143	Are there any good guides for what to take on a bicycle trek on the Pacific coast (Seattle to San Francisco)?	<p>I'll be cycling through relatively lonely areas for a few weeks (towns every 40 miles or so).  I'm looking for a good guide on what gear to pack.</p>  <p>It's the Pacific coast trail from Seattle to San Francisco during June.  Weather should be fairly sunny but possibly foggy in mornings.  Road conditions should be nice.  Camping most nights, with the occasional hotel.  Meals will be mostly bought along the way, with some food taken along just in case.  No previous experience with travel cycling, but a few summers of 300 mile weeks commuting to and from work.</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p> 
6609	Schengen visa requirements and "validation"	<p>As an Indian citizen there are a bunch of requirements to get a Schengen visa. Some of them are: A reserved ticket (please do correct me if I am wrong) and confirmed hotel reservations.</p>  <p>Now, if I don't need reserved tickets but just an itinerary, do I really have to make the trip as soon as I get the visa or can I just do that any other time before the visa expires?</p>  <p>Is there a rule that says that "if you don't make your Schengen zone trip as soon as you get your visa, it would expire"?</p> 
27672	Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don't want to stay in Greece at all?	<p>I want to travel to Spain however the requirements state that my UK residence permit be valid for 3 months after intended date of departure from the Schengen area. I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p>

In order to figure what gear I need to pack to camp (particularly for the sleeping bag), I would like to know what temperatures to expect.</p>  <p>I am interested in historical temperatures to figure the usual temperature and I might look at them for other seasons.

24469	Transportation from St Pancras station to ExCel convention center	<p>I am planning a group trip to see a convention in London next month. We will be arriving by Eurostar, and we'll need to reach our hotels which are located close to the ExCel convention center.</p>  <p>The public transportation route seems simple : riding the tube on Circle line then the DLR.</p>  <p>There is a visitor Oyster and a regular Oyster. What's the difference? I'm not interested by a more expensive tourist thing with attraction discounts; I just need the transportation. For example, this is the case in Paris with Paris Visite (tourist ripoff with the museum vouchers) versus Mobilis (used by locals) tickets, both used as day passes. </p>  <p>I heard that buying single-trip tickets on the Tube is VERY expensive, and do not figure out the approximative cost of an Oyster card for every passenger. I would like to optimize the cost of this transportation leg. Which solution would be the most suitable, at which cost per passenger?</p>  <p>Also, are there any group discounts offered? We will be 10 people at least.</p>

6397	From whom can I buy travel insurance if I don't "live" anywhere?	<p>I am an Australian citizen, currently living in Singapore and I want to travel through Europe and the USA over the next six months. I will be leaving Singapore permanently and my intent is to ultimately land back in Australia, at least for a while, but this may not happen.</p>  <p>From whom can I buy travel insurance? Most consumer travel insurance plans which offer the type of cover I want (Covermore et al) assume you have a "country of residence". Effectively, I don't and that would invalidate my policy.</p>  <p>As a bonus, I'd prefer if I could specify I'll only be in the USA for three weeks and only pay the extra premium for that time, rather than it doubling the cost for the whole six months.</p>

20184	Are Australian passports expensive in comparison to other western / developed countries?	<p>I decided not to renew my passport before starting this trip because passports are very expensive in comparison to my income and my low travel budget.</p>  <p>But when asking people I find their passports in other countries are much more affordable than in my country. Typically Australian passports are in the range of roughly double the price friends have to pay in other developed countries or other western countries.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Ordinary adult passport:<br> <code>AUD</code> $238  (<code>USD</code> $212; <code>EUR</code> 161)</p></li> <li><p>Adult frequent traveller with more pages:<br> <code>AUD</code> $358  (<code>USD</code> $320; <code>EUR</code> 243)</p></li> </ul>  <p>Is this a rip-off? Are most passports in "rich" countries so expensive or are they roughly half the price as the impression I have so far?</p>  <hr>  <p>It's true I overlooked passport validity. That's the most important thing I've learned with this question. Assuming all passports have the same number of "visa pages" I should instead ask what the <strong>"price per year or decade of validity"</strong> is.</p> 
38430	Is a Budapest "transfer ticket" valid for Bus then Metro then Tram?	<p>I've just discovered that the railway line to Budapest airport goes to the terminal that's closed (Terminal 1), and not to the one that everyone currently uses (Terminal 2), and therefore I'll have to get a bus (200E) to the train or metro to get into the city centre.</p>  <p>My hotel have suggested that the quickest way to reach them by public transport from the airport is to take the 200E bus to the last stop, Kőbánya-Kispest, change to the metro, then later change to a tram. From the map I've found on the <a href="http://www.bkk.hu/en/maps/" rel="nofollow">BKK website</a>, that all looks fine.</p>  <p>That then leads me onto the ticket required. I've had a read of the <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Budapest#Tickets_and_passes" rel="nofollow">WikiVoyage page for Budapest under Tickets &amp; Passes</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bkk.hu/en/prices/" rel="nofollow">BKK tickets page in English</a>, but I'm still not sure. I'm fairly sure that the Single ticket (vonaljegy) for HUF 350 is no good. I would've thought that a Transfer ticket (átszállójegy) would cover me, which WikiVoyage describes as <em>Valid for one journey within the city limits, transfer allowed</em> (since it's one journey with transfers Bus-Metro and Metro-Tram), but having read the <a href="http://www.bkk.hu/en/prices/transfer-ticket-2/" rel="nofollow">BKK English page on that ticket</a> I'm now less sure.</p>  <p>So, to take the 200E bus from the Airport, then the metro, and then a tram, all as a single journey, what is the ticket I should be trying to buy?</p> 
38432	How do you use a Budapest 5/30 travelcard?	<p>When looking over the <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Budapest#Tickets_and_passes" rel="nofollow">WikiVoyage Budapest page of public transport tickets</a>, I spotted an interesting looking ticket for a trip which sees me needing to travel quite a bit on two weekends, but not the week inbetween:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>5/30 travel card:</strong> 5 one-day travel cards. This booklet of 5 slips is valid for 30 days. Before beginning a 24 hour period of travel, mark the date and time with pen on an unused slip. Do not tear even used slips out of the booklet. </p> </blockquote>  <p>I also found <a href="http://www.bkk.hu/en/prices/530-bkk-24-hour-travelcard/" rel="nofollow">something about it on the English BKK website</a>, but I'm not sure I've fully understood it. Given the warnings on the <a href="http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Budapest#Tickets_and_passes" rel="nofollow">WikiVoyage page</a> about ticket inspectors showing no lenience to confused tourists, I don't want to get it wrong!</p>  <p>Assuming I can find somewhere to sell me one of these on arrival:</p>  <ul> <li>Am I correct in thinking it offers unlimited use of trams, buses and metros, with unlimited transfers, for 24 hours after each ticket starts?</li> <li>What must I (and mustn't I) write and where whenever I want to start a new 24 hours?</li> <li>Do I need to do any validating of the ticket when using it, or is writing in enough?</li> </ul> 
35309	Getting around in London without preordering Oyster card	<p>In about 20 hours I will be leaving for a trip that will take me to London.

Are one-day travelcards are still available without having Oyster?</p> 
38384	Is there a "safest" route through Pakistan (from China to Iran)?	<p>On my upcoming trip I'll be starting in Asia and would love to travel overland to Europe, especially via Iran.</p>  <p>Usually I'm not scared or intimidated by "dangerous" destinations. China is a breeze and I'm not at all fazed by Iran, having met lots of lovely Iranians and a few travellers who had great times there.</p>  <p>But last time I intended to visit Pakistan from China I was told the Hunza Valley area had no terrorists and was perfectly safe. But a few weeks before my trip there were ten tourists murdered by terrorists dressed as police at a mountain in Gilgit province, quite close to where I hoped to go.</p>  <p>Violence directed specifically at foreigners, westerners, or tourists is one thing that does put me off a destination.</p>  <p>But this doesn't necessarily put me off a whole country if I can be reasonably assured that I only have to avoid certain areas.</p>  <p>So is there a particularly "safe" route from China to Iran via Pakistan (and not via Afghanistan)?</p> 
38441	Which are safe and unsafe regions in Iran?	<p>Now there's a lot of propaganda in the west that leads us to believe Iran is dangerous and travellers shouldn't go there.</p>  <p>Obviously there are major political disagreements between several governments and the Iranian government and this should be taken into account.</p>  <p>But at a human level I have met many Iranians travelling elsewhere in the world and have found them to be friendly, charming, and hospitable. I have also met several western travellers who spent time in Iran, including hitchhiking around the country, who only have wonderful things to say about the country and its people.</p>  <p>As a traveller I've learned to trust the most what I hear from other travellers about a destination, especially ones which prefer similar ways of travel to myself. I've also learned to trust the opinions of inhabitants of countries bordering on the destination country the least.</p>  <p>Yet some people still insist that Iran is not safe for a traveller, or that <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/38384/is-there-a-safest-route-through-pakistan-from-china-to-iran#comment69250_38422">it depends greatly on which area of Iran</a>.</p>  <p>I can look up for myself the general travel advisories issued by governments and disclaimers in WikiVoyage. So please don't regurgitate those an answers.</p>  <p>I want to know from travellers who've been there, from Iranians, or from references to specific incidents targeting foreigners/westers about which parts of Iran are no problem, and which parts should be avoided, even by experienced intrepid travellers.</p>  <p>(I realize any advice won't apply to Israeli citizens unfortunately. I'm Australian.)</p>

3198	How many countries are there in the world to travel to?	<p>If you've travelled a bit, at some point you'll either have dreamed of or been asked - 'will you visit every country in the world?'.  However, it's not a straightforward goal to aim for...</p>  <p>I've heard much debate on this.  Is Kosovo a country? Not according to the U.N.!  Is Gibraltar a country? Do you separate England, Scotland and Wales?  Is French Guyana a part of France?</p>  <p>Chris Guillebeau, one of the most well known travellers and country counters, has over <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/places-ive-been/" rel="nofollow">160 countries under his belt</a>.  Of course, as you travel you realise it becomes harder and harder to define what IS a country...</p>  <p><em><strong>bonus:</em></strong></p>  <p>And so, for the country counters or just those who may have a definitive answer (with references please) - how many countries are there in the world that you would consider you have travelled to, if you'd been to all of them?</p>

4413	Is it really permitted for travellers to work while visiting Georgia on a tourist visa?	<p>Last night at a party with lots of expats and Georgians the topic came up that foreigners don't need any special visa or work permit to work in Georgia while they are visiting the country as tourists.</p>  <p>But can this really be true? Both Georgians and foreigners there said it was but I want to find an authoritative source because the consequences for working illegally can include deportation or being banned from future visits. I wouldn't want to tell people to come and work here on their travels if the advice could get them in trouble.</p> 
2310	Which countries, if any, offer on-arrival work visas?	<p>After seeing <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2287/108">this question</a> I began wondering - are there countries that say, Aussies or Kiwis (or anyone else) can get a work visa on arrival, or while in the country?</p>  <p>The best I've found is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html">http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html</a></p>  <p>which indicates availability of working holiday programs, but for several of them (Argentina for example) you are required to apply to Wellington (in my case) before being accepted.</p>  <p>Chile, on the other hand, you can't get one on arrival, but you can apply for one while being a tourist in the country.</p>  <p>So a chart or definitive source of countries where you can basically wander in and start working (legally) would be the ideal answer for this :D</p>

23633	Use of Travel insurance while going to Europe	<p>I am planning to visit Europe this weekend. I received travel insurance on behalf of my Indian tour operator and has coverage like delay of checked in baggage, dental, medical, and a lot of other stuff.</p>  <p>My question is where exactly do I need to display the copy of travel insurance normally (not referring to while making any claim)</p>  <p>Is it checked by the airline desk or customs/immigration ?</p> 
7744	Free / cheap ways to get airport lounge access?	<p>Until recently, I had a complimentary <a href="http://www.prioritypass.com/">Priority Pass</a> card. Although the Priority Pass lounges aren't generally great, they are better than nothing when travelling on an airline where you don't have frequent flyer status.</p>  <p>Priority Pass is extremely expensive, however, and to me at least isn't worth paying for.</p>  <p>What other free or cheap ways are there of getting access to a lounge apart from Priority Pass and having frequent flyer status? I live in the UK, if it's relevant.</p> 
7775	Is 50 minutes enough time to transfer between Terminal A and C at Newark (EWR)?	<p>We'll be arriving at Newark airport (with two kids under 7) at Terminal A and our flight connection is in Terminal C.

2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>". In one <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa/1214#1214">answer</a> it is said that "international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible". The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p> 
35418	How can I get help understanding UK visa requirements?	<p>There are already many questions on visa requirements to enter the UK, including transit visas and visitor visa for family members (e.g. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/35394/can-a-thai-national-married-to-a-uk-citizen-enter-the-uk-freely">Can a Thai national married to a UK citizen enter the UK freely?</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/6807/non-eu-spouse-of-an-eu-citizen-is-visiting-eu-without-needing-a-visa-possible">Non-EU spouse of an EU citizen - is visiting EU without needing a visa possible?</a>).</p>  <p>Some of the rules seem very complicated.

38382	United Airlines' online check-in procedure : "stay" or "transit" for one night?	<p>I have booked flights which involve me transiting through the USA (Newark) en route to Costa Rica. My itinerary includes an overnight stay in New York; I'll be spending the night with relatives.</p>  <p>I went through United Airlines' online check-in process and I was asked if I was travelling to the USA for transit or if I would be staying. (I imagine I'll be asked a similar question at the immigration desk when I arrive in Newark.)</p>  <p>As a UK citizen, I already have an ESTA through the Visa Waiver Program; this question is <strong>not</strong> about visa requirements.</p>  <p>Which box should I tick? Am I transiting, or staying?</p> 
5576	Visiting a lounge in T1 at Dubai International Airport, during a layover at T3?	<p>For an upcoming trip, I have a layover of 2.5 hours in Dubai. Both flights are with Emirates, and arrive / leave from Terminal 3.</p>  <p>As the first flight is overnight, I'll want to freshen up, and a shower would be ideal. Through my credit card, I have access to a lounge in T3 which doesn't offer showers (plus apparently has really slow wifi), or a lounge in T1 which does have a shower (and apparently has both better wifi and better food). So, the lounge in T1 sounds better for more needs than the T3 one.</p>  <p>What I'm not sure of is if I can make it from T3 to T1 and back again, with enough time to spend in T1 to make it worth going?</p>  <p>(I guess I'll need to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure for the connecting flight, for an Emirates international departure? If so, that'd give me about 2 hours from stepping off the plane, assuming it's on time, until I need to be back in T3 at the gate)</p>

38499	Do I need UK Transit Visa from India to USA with valid US Visa	<p>I will be travelling to Phoenix, USA via London with valid US Visa and onwards journey boarding pass with Indian Passport. I have 18+ hours layover in London. I want to know How likely is to get the 24 hours transit in London. Its a long time and I don't want just to waste it by staying at airport. I want to go to hotel to have some rest and then probably visit some places.  I can see I come under "Transit without Visa concession" but I heard it depends on visa officer to allow to go out or deny. If they won't allow Will I get visa on arrival. </p>  <p>Also I tried to apply for Transit Visa. Its asking me Whether you want to go for sight seeing or not. I said Yes. Its saying me you have to apply for different visa. If I am going out of airport then its natural I will go for sightseeing? I just can't close my eyes and roam around. What other reasons would be there to go out? What do you guys suggest? What to do? I am totally confused.</p>  <p>For those of you who are saying its already answered before. Please read question carefully. Here I am trying to get the exact meaning of Visitor in Transit Visa. That's never answered here in this community. </p>

2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
11633	Travel to Cuba as dual citizen (USA+other)?	<p>Suppose I am a U.S. citizen with dual citizenship with another country.  Citizens of this second country are allowed to travel to Cuba.

19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p>

25522	What's the quickest way from London Kings Cross to Euston, by foot or tube?	<p>My train to London Kings Cross has just been cancelled, so instead of having plenty of time to make a connection to Euston, I'm going to have a mad dash...</p>  <p>To get from Kings Cross to Euston I have a number of options, but given that my train ticket includes an Underground journey, I'm thinking that either walking (fast!) or tube would be my best bet. Given the tight connection, I'm after the fastest way to do it. What would that be?</p>  <p>Based on <a href="http://stations.aeracode.org/#kxx">this 3D model of Kings Cross / St Pancras underground station</a>, I see that none of the underground lines are that close to the Northern Ticket hall where my later train will come into. At the Euston end, I know that Euston Square station is quite a fair way from Euston station itself, which the Victoria or Northern Lines are quite deep so there'd be walking + escalators to get up to the surface (plus the <a href="http://stations.aeracode.org/#kxx">long walk+escalator</a> at the KX end to get to them). Walking wise, not sure which is the quickest way to go, but I suspect it wouldn't necessarily be the "obvious" one along Euston Road.</p>  <p>So, which is the quickest way - tube (if so which) or fast walk (if so which way)?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

38441	Which are safe and unsafe regions in Iran?	<p>Now there's a lot of propaganda in the west that leads us to believe Iran is dangerous and travellers shouldn't go there.</p>  <p>Obviously there are major political disagreements between several governments and the Iranian government and this should be taken into account.</p>  <p>But at a human level I have met many Iranians travelling elsewhere in the world and have found them to be friendly, charming, and hospitable. I have also met several western travellers who spent time in Iran, including hitchhiking around the country, who only have wonderful things to say about the country and its people.</p>  <p>As a traveller I've learned to trust the most what I hear from other travellers about a destination, especially ones which prefer similar ways of travel to myself. I've also learned to trust the opinions of inhabitants of countries bordering on the destination country the least.</p>  <p>Yet some people still insist that Iran is not safe for a traveller, or that <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/38384/is-there-a-safest-route-through-pakistan-from-china-to-iran#comment69250_38422">it depends greatly on which area of Iran</a>.</p>  <p>I can look up for myself the general travel advisories issued by governments and disclaimers in WikiVoyage. So please don't regurgitate those an answers.</p>  <p>I want to know from travellers who've been there, from Iranians, or from references to specific incidents targeting foreigners/westers about which parts of Iran are no problem, and which parts should be avoided, even by experienced intrepid travellers.</p>  <p>(I realize any advice won't apply to Israeli citizens unfortunately. I'm Australian.)</p> 
11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p> 
21041	Closest skiing to Indochina	<p>From a developed, connected part of SEA - oh, let's say, Thailand - where is the nearest skiing?   Mostly thinking of shortest travel time (eg, to go for a long weekend), but would also be interested in physically closest.</p>  <p>Japan jumped to mind, as I know there is skiing in Hokkaido. <br>I heard a rumor about a ski place in Burma, which would be interesting; when I tried to find information about it online, though, I only come up with references to plans/ideas to develop a fairly remote mountain (Hkakabo Razi) that don't seem near fruition.</p>  <p>Ideally, information about the development-level, difficulty, and approximate costs of the place(s) would be great.   <br>(I imagine that anywhere in Japan is going to be developed to a typical US/EU standard, maybe on the easy side (groomers), and fairly pricey.  Once upon a time, I read about skiing in Kashmir with pack-mules for 'chairlifts' - which would be interesting, although maybe too remote for a short trip.)</p>

So, we were wondering what the best (which means fastest but also easiest when carrying two large pieces of luggage and two carry-ons) way to get from LHR to King's Cross?</p>  <p>I gather that, with only one changeover, we can take the Tube. However, in the interest of other passengers, we thought it would be best to take a taxi, or maybe a bus?</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>

7650	How to transit through Delhi without a visa?	<p>I have read a lot on this subject on the Lonely Planet forum and it looks like the staff on ground can transfer your bags through the Delhi airport if you have a connecting flight without you having to go out to check them in again and therefore needing a visa. I refer of course to the situation when you go with 2 different airlines, because otherwise the luggage is transfered automatically.</p>  <p>I posted a <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7405/how-to-get-from-delhi-to-kathmandu-overland">question about overground travel to Kathmandu</a> and mentioned it briefly there, however I think this subject deserves a separate question and a detailed answer.</p>  <p>Does it depend on the type on an airline? I have read that Jet is no problem, what about AirIndia and IndiGo? And what about the incoming flight to Delhi from Europe or USA, do they all can hand over you luggage to the Indian airlines and pick it up again on the way home? Do you have to contact them before and explain your situation? Or check in your luggage directly to your desired destination?</p> 
22849	Overstaying Schengen Visa for 1 day	<p>I was in Germany last September, my visa said I had 14 days to stay in the Schengen area.</p>  <p>When I was leaving back for Egypt the passport control officer noticed that I was leaving on the 15th day. I didn't even realise that as I had written previously in my visa application that I was staying for 15 days and the embassy in Cairo had my complete airline ticket with specific dates.</p>  <p>Anyway the officer just filed a report on the incident but didn't stamp my passport with my exit date from the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Do any of you guys know if that would make it harder for me to be granted a visa in the future?</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident.

14334	Where to exchange Euros(EUR) to Pounds(GBP) near Frankfurt or in Edinburgh	<p>I'm planning a trip to Scotland and I want to know where would be the best place to exchange British Pounds (GBP). I think that the exchange rates at the airports are not good, so my options are  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Rhine-Main" rel="nofollow">the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">Edinburgh</a>.

I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p>

1866	Are trains stopping between stations to let passengers board/alight just a Canadian thing?	<p>I happened to notice this little gem on the VIA Rail <a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/stops-between-two-explore-our-destinations/stations">website</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>On some VIA Rail routes, you can get off and on the train exactly where you want — even in places where there is no scheduled stop! The ideal solution for outdoor activities - at that little lake deep in the forest, or that wild river you've been dreaming of for so long!</p> </blockquote>  <p>It's only valid on some routes, and only with at least 48 hours notice, but it seems an interesting idea.</p>  <p>I've previously made of use of a similar thing on the long distance CityLink buses in the Scottish Highlands (from a typical timetable: <em>pick up at all the stops listed above and all bus stops and intermediate points where it is safe for the coach to stop following a clear signal being given by the intending passenger</em>), and I know a lot of regular rural buses do a similar thing too.</p>  <p>However, I've never come across trains doing this before. Is this a special Canadian thing, or does it happen elsewhere in the world too?</p>

4839	Computer geek tourist attractions in the San Francisco Bay Area & Silicon Valley?	<p>We're planning a family vacation to the San Francisco Bay Area &amp; Silicon Valley, and one of the highlights I don't want to miss is the <a href="http://computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a>.  However, I didn't find that listed in the free guides we got from our auto club.  So:</p>  <ol> <li>What other definitive "computer geek" attractions should we consider on our trip to the area?</li> <li>Are there any area travel guidebooks for folks interested in computing and its history?</li> <li>What other resources, online or otherwise, should we have a look at?</li> </ol>

Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p>

35723	Is there a crowdfunding platform for trips?	<p>I often organise trips with a large group of friends. It is always a pain to get everybody to commit and pay in time to cover the deposits and/or book the tickets. It would be so convenient if it would be possible to let people commit similar to how people commit on a project on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" rel="nofollow">indiegogo</a> or <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" rel="nofollow">kickstarter</a>. </p>  <p>I was considering using indiegogo to setup a campaing, e.g. Lets go to Paris, and start making reservations once a minimal number of friends paid and committed to the trip. However, Indiegogo aims at reaching as many people as possible, whereas I would like to limit the crowd to very limited inner circle of friends. </p>  <p>Does a crowdfunding platform exist to cover very small travel projects to cover the initial costs? I could of course use the conventional method by letting people commit by transfer the initial funds by wire transfer. However, the beauty of projects like indiegogo, is that people commit and only if a target is reached their credit card is charged. If the target isn't reached, I don't have to deal with all the refunds. </p>

11070	How can I find an ATM card usable in Cuba, by a US Citizen?	<p>It is apparently quite easy to enter Cuba (illegally) as a U.S. citizen, by flying from a third country.</p>  <p>But according to Wikitravel, it can be tricky using a <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Americans_in_Cuba#Buy">credit card</a> while there:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>For Americans, all credit and debit cards from any US financial institution will not work in Cuba. For everyone else, any credit card issued by a foreign bank with a US parent company or US processing firm will also be blocked. <em>In most cases, International VISA- and Mastercard-branded global payment (debit) and credit cards will work, but only if completely unaffiliated with any US subsidiary or US-owned clearinghouse.</em> (emphasis added)</p> </blockquote>  <p>How can I find such a bank, which will allow a U.S. citizen to open an account?</p>  <p>And I should add, if it makes a difference: It should be possible to open an account with such a bank remotely (by Internet ideally, but acceptably by phone, or mail).</p> 
3983	Packing a cardbox box as checked luggage	<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3748/flying-with-a-desktop-computer-as-checked-luggage">another question</a>, I'm planning on traveling with a desktop computer as checked baggage. After considering the options, I've decided to take it in its original cardboard box (used for shipping), making sure to pad everything inside very well.</p>  <p>What should I do to securely prepare the box before checking it in? Some suggestions others have given me so far:</p>  <ul> <li>Spray paint the box black so it's not obvious there's a computer inside.</li> <li>Wrap the entire box with duct tape to reinforce it.</li> <li>Use tape to seal the "hand holes" on either side used for carrying the box.</li> <li>Run packing tape around all the edges to reinforce the box.</li> <li><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3984/what-do-fragile-stickers-on-checked-baggage-do">Write "FRAGILE" on multiple sides of the box.</a></li> </ul> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p> 
5650	Are carry-on bags being weighed on long-haul flights?	<p>It's been four years since our last international flights. We're flying with Air New Zealand from the US to Oz. </p>  <p>And we are seeing weight limits for carry-on baggage. Are the carriers actually weighing carry-on baggage these days? I've never had anything carry-on weighed before and so this was a surprise (and a potential excess baggage hassle) if they are doing it.</p>  <p><strong>Edit March 4th</strong>: The bags were not weighed for the SFO-MEL flight. This could be due to the flight being only 2/3rds full (we saw nothing carry-on being weighed by Air NZ).</p>  <p>We did happen to hear American Airlines announcing that every carry-on bag going on one of their flights would be both measured and weighed. So a bit of "pot-luck" involved. </p> 
890	Is there any trick to checking in more weight on planes?	<p>I soon have to move from France to Spain, one way no coming back. And as with most of the airlines carriers in Europe I am allowed at 23Kg checked-in and 10Kg on board with me. Packing lifetime stuff in 33Kg is not an easy task.</p>  <p>I was wondering if some of you have trick to either check in more weight or any other trick so they can go with more kilos.</p> 
1224	Tactics to avoid getting harassed by corrupt police?	<p>In Uzbekistan I was stopped, searched and questioned six times in one day.</p>  <p>At the border with Tajikistan, one official tried hiding my paperwork to elicit something from me.</p>  <p>In Kyrgyzstan, I was physically harassed and detained by the police, and about US$30 taken while they searched everything on me and a Dutch backpacker I was going to get food with.</p>  <p>I'm not particularly dodgy looking - it's happening to a lot of backpackers I meet.  Tourists are apparently a prime target for corrupt officials.</p>  <p>Any suggestions or tactics for avoiding these occurrences?  Aside from carrying only photocopies of your passport so that they can't hold your passport ransom, I've not heard many successful tips...</p> 
3396	Making calls from Romania	<p>I am heading to Romania for work at the beginning of December.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me the cheapest way to communicate in real time from Romania to the US?  I am going to be taking my laptop.  Is the bandwidth in Romania fast enough to do Skype to Skype from WiFi in my hotel room?  Can I buy a cheap pay as you go phone from a Romanian wireless carrier?  I have a Blackberry Storm2 on Verizon, but they want $1.29/min, can I use it some other way?  What's my best option?</p> 
18126	Where can I socialize with young Japanese people?	<p>One of the things I like about travelling to Japan is that it's possible, if you know some Japanese, to travel to destinations where your fellow travellers are predominantly domestic travellers, rather than from your own country. I enjoy having a two hour breakfast talking to fellow travellers, late nights in an izakaya, or talking in English to schoolchildren at a museum. The problem is, most people I meet are either schoolchildren or retirees!</p>  <p>Outside of public holiday periods like Golden Week, what destinations within Japan have a large proportion of travellers who are Japanese, and in their twenties and thirties? Preferably not overwhelmingly male.</p> 
37439	Why are airlines against the transferring of tickets to other persons?	<p>Airlines usually either don't allow the transferring of tickets to another person after they've been purchased, or they do it at an extremely inflated price. What is the reason for doing this?</p>  <p>One idea I came up with would be to allow authorities to do background checks, but one could buy a ticket at the airport shortly before the flight. Of course, it would be more expensive and there would be the risk of a fully booked plane, but it is not impossible.</p> 
37559	Why are plane tickets more expensive if they don't include a weekend?	<p>When I used to fly for business (depart and return within the work-week) I observed that ticket prices were much higher than if a weekend was included at one end or in the middle. I was told that it is because business travelers will pay more. I think that is outrageous! Why should the airline care if I depart on Tuesday and return Thursday of the same week, or the next week? Only because it is business travel?</p> 
7585	What exactly is a open-jaw flight?	<p>Recently, I was looking for a flight from A to B and then a flight back from C to A. Using my English dictionary, I found that this is called an open-jaw flight. However, several native English speaker stated, that they never heard the term. Others mentioned that it is only an open-jaw flight if BC is shorter than AB and/or CA.</p>  <p>Therefore I would like to see a canonical definition of an open-jaw flight. I'm also interested in a term that describes the flight legs described above. In German it is called Gabelflug, but what is the English term?</p>

6711	Not flying the last segment of the first half of a return flight	<p>I have booked a A->B->C | C->B->A flight. What I want to do is to not fly the B->C segment. While skipping the final B->A would be totally fine (just walk out of the airport), I'm afraid that the airline might cancel my return flight if I skip the B->C. Should I worry about that or is this a non-issue? Also - is there any way to make it with checked luggage (for example letting them know when I check in at A that I will actually not fly all the way to C) or is that impossible?</p> 
8870	Can I get a cheaper one-way flight by booking and cancelling a flexible return leg for a refund?	<p>I’m looking to book a one-way flight from the UK to a European city. The airline [I don’t think it matters which one specifically; this question is really about the principle] wants to charge around £400 for a one-way ticket, but only around £100 each way if I book a return. I can select different tariffs for the two legs, so it looks like it would be possible to book the (low-cost) “advance/saver” tariff for the outbound leg and a (refundable) “flexible” tariff for the return leg.</p>  <p>So can I book a return like this, fly the outbound leg, then cancel the return leg for a refund? Or am I likely to hit some restriction in the small print that will prevent me?</p>  <p>(I don’t know whether this kind of thing is frowned upon as “gaming the system”, or if it’s simply “using the system to my own best advantage”…)</p>

If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p>

37127	Minimum available passport blank page requirements	<p>For a British Citizen travelling on business to one country for up to 30 days what are the maximum numbers of consecutive and not-necessarily-consecutive minimum blank pages required in a passport when applying for a single-entry visa <strike>and which country (or countries) imposes them</strike>? </p>  <p>An answer which is just two numbers (presumably each a single digit) would be adequate. </p>  <hr>  <p>Small (eg Maldives) island nations may be ignored.<br> Where custom and practice departs from regulations (eg SA) it is the former that is more my interest.<br> I see a Canadian heard mention of a need for six blank pages.<br> Three for each seems more plausible, but I have not found which countries stipulate that, if any.<br> I recognise that what is correct today may be out-of-date tomorrow.</p> 
27225	How do I decide whether to be worried about having enough blank pages in my passport?	<p>I am planning a long trip over a year from now. The tentative itinerary is</p>  <ul> <li>Canada</li> <li>USA (maybe LA, maybe Hawaii, doesn't matter, I have Nexus)</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>New Caledonia</li> <li>Vanuatu</li> <li>Fiji</li> <li>Samoa</li> <li>New Zealand</li> <li>Cook Islands</li> <li>Tahiti</li> <li>Easter Island</li> <li>Chile (or possibly back to places we have been before)</li> <li>Canada</li> </ul>  <p>I will be traveling on a Canadian passport. All of these countries are (for me) "you can stay 30 days without a visa" or "visa on arrival" except for Australia, which is an electronic visa. </p>  <p>In my past travels, some countries have been pretty good about fitting 4 stamps on a page (eg Bulgaria stamped on the way in and out, but they chose the page that the Netherlands had used for in and out.) However not all have been. Australia put their entry stamp on an otherwise empty page and then found a different empty page for the exit stamp. </p>  <p>I have three blank single pages scattered among the stamped-on pages, and then a stretch of 12 single blank pages running to the end. My passport is one-third full, then, and I have almost 3 years left on it. But I am a little worried this trip will fill it up. If each of the 10 not-Canada, not-US places consumes one page for the entry stamp and one for the exit, I will not have enough pages. But if they're more like Bulgaria was, I'm fine. Further, if travel from New Zealand to the Cook Islands and from Easter Island to Chile is considered domestic, there may not even be stamping involved for those legs.</p>  <p>It is not possible to add more pages to a Canadian passport. It is not normally permitted to renew less than a year before it expires, though you can request it and you need a good reason. "My passport is full" is a good reason. I don't know if "I have calculated my passport will be close to full" is a good reason or not. Further, I don't intend to spend long enough in any place to allow for the time it would take to renew my full passport and continue along my journey, should it become full along the way.</p>  <p>Bottom line: not just "should I be worried?" but "how can I tell whether to be worried or not?" Some specific subquestions:</p>  <ul> <li>is there a way to tell whether a given country uses a 1/4 page standard size stamp, or glues a piece of paper into the passport, and the size of that piece of paper?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance which countries use exit stamps?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance whether trips between countries that belong to each other are domestic (eg LA to Hawaii will not generate anyone a stamp) or not - thinking of the Cook Islands and Easter Island for me, but generally applicable</li> <li>any specific advice about wildly early renewal of a Canadian passport would also be good</li> </ul> 
21898	Can a group of people become a travel agent, with the purpose to get access to direct acess to professional travel resources?	<p>At work we travel frequently. Finding the appropriate deals is always a balance between saving time and saving money. Booking through corporate travel agencies is often the most time efficient way of booking tickets. BUT they are often quite expensive, but the biggest downside of these agencies is their flexibility. They usually sell the most flexible tickets, but that is where the flexibility ends. Don't expect them to be flexible in terms of different modes of transports (parking at airport, trains, ferries, venue locations, etc). That is also something you cannot expect from them.</p>  <p>The alternative is that you start booking yourself. Doing it yourself gives you the best flexibility in syncing the itinerary with your personal schedule. But then you end up in the mess in trying to make sense in the different airfares and possibilities.  Sites like <a href="http://www.rome2rio.com" rel="nofollow">rome2rio</a> go a long way, but travel agents always seem to have more insight in the options. </p>  <p>Is it possible and does it makes sense to become a "travel agent" for a small business, ngo, or any group that can't afford to let all its employees travel business class. If so, how can you become a travel agent yourself, not to make a living out of it, but to be able to have better insight in fares and issue your own tickets?</p>  <p>CAVEAT: I edited the question, the answers given show that I gave the impression that I wanted to start a business, I have no intend to do so, I merely want to have access to the same resources as a travel agent .</p> 
3398	Are there any tour group comparison websites?	<p>After having good experiences with the various websites for comparing flight prices (Expedia, Orbitz, etc), I was wondering whether there's anything similar for tours that compares times, prices, itineraries, etc?  I have a handful of tour operator websites that I check but I can obviously only check the ones I know about.</p> 
19445	Group Discounted Airfare	<p>There's a lot of sites out there advertising discounts for groups or help coordinating group travel however I can't find a lot of information on how beneficial this actually is.  I'm looking for someone to speak from personal experience what kind of discounts they've received from airlines on various flights, specifically non regional carriers.  Also, any tips in booking group travel would be much appreciated.  </p> 
37249	Small suitcase with top-loading? Does it exist?	<p>I usually just use carry-ons because I can take out and put stuff in without having to lay it down horizontally but due a recent physical issue I need a suitcase that can be loaded and unloaded from the top...are there any companies that make such a thing?  I'm absolutely not looking for backpack/trekking type bags but more wheeled luggage or not...</p>  <p>Edit:Yes, like a pilot style bag that's carry on size or larger is fine.  So, are there suitcases that can be fully functional standing upright with no need lay it horizontal or must I buy bags catered to pilots?  Cause the pilot ones are so low profile you REALLY have to bend though it is top loading...</p>  <p>Edit 2.0: I'm looking for suitcase/bags (even with no wheels) such as the Briggs U116... it opens up top but a bit too tiny for a week of travel stuff, yes?  :-) Those cases made for computer storage are too tiny as well...so it doesn't exist?  A bag with structure would be awesome.</p>

33884	Are there any flights which permits a Sikh to carry a kirpan?	<p>I am a religious Sikh from Jalandhar, India. I have not travelled outside of the country for a single time so far. However my family is pestering me to take them for a jolly holiday trip to a different country.</p>  <p>I have a problem with that. I am deeply religious and I carry the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan">kirpan</a> always with me wherever I go, keeping in line with the tenets of my religion. However I can foresee that flight security are likely to view the kirpan as a dangerous weapon and will not allow me inside the aeroplane. </p>  <p>How can I overcome this? Is it possible to excuse me for religious reasons? Is there some tolerant flight/country which will empathise with my religious needs?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gfspq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

The cheapest flights (Qantas) have a connection via Dubai. </p>  <p>I have more than one citizenship, so I can avoid using an Israeli passport (phew), but I'm still concerned that I might be stopped at some point due to my surname, "Yehudi", which literally translates to "Jew" in both Hebrew and Arabic. I'm not a religious Jew, but that's pretty much beside the point I should imagine. </p>  <p>Does anyone else with a markedly Jewish name have experience passing through Dubai, or does anyone know of cases when it may have been done safely?</p> 
2173	Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?	<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>  <p>Booking 1 (British Airways): Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>  <p>Booking 2 (Emirates): Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>  <p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p> 
39042	Can you transit through Dubai airport when holding an Israeli passport?	<p>Is it possible for an Israeli passport holder to transit through Dubai airport? Obviously assuming that the person stays air-side, has a connection on the same ticket, and the next flight leaves within the same day.</p> 
423	US Customs Pre-clearance in foreign airports	<p>Recently, I was traveling back to the US through Vancouver, BC, Canada.  I was delighted with the fact that I was able to get pre-screened through US Customs before even getting on the plane.  What other cities/airports offer this feature?  It sure saved a lot of time.</p> 
13464	What harm can be done with a copy of one's passport?	<p>In one of the questions on this site, it was suggested the use of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/6602/141">Dropbox</a> to save a backup copy of your passport, in case you need to proof who you are if your original document is lost. </p>  <p>I like the idea, but what if someone gets access to your Dropbox folders and is able to acquire the copy of your passport.  The same goes for when you leave a copy of your passport at a hotel receptions desk. Once someone has the info printed on that copy, would that make it easier to steal your identity?</p> 
22137	At what kind of eateries can you have a lamb roast in Australia?	<p>Apart from being in a homestay or being invited to someone's house, where <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt1YV9Bj72c">mum can cook a lamb roast</a>, where can you have a lamb roast in Australia?</p>  <p>I'm more asking in terms of what kind of eatery you'd go to, rather than a specific restaurant. Would you go to a pub, a club, an up-market restaurant, a buffet place like Sizzler's, or somewhere else?</p>  <p>Related question: <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/4280/324">What foods must I try while visiting Australia?</a></p> 
30522	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for Canada?	<p>I'm passing through Canada, on my way to somewhere else. I'm staying only a short time. </p>  <p>Is there a website, or some other way of find out out if I need a visa?</p> 
22604	Will my checked luggage freeze in the airplane?	<p>I'm taking some freeze-sensitive items in a checked luggage for a short flight. It's <strong>cheese, chocolate, toothpaste and wine</strong>. I would like to know whether the luggage can get "frozen" in the aircraft. Sometimes it happened to me that my stuff actually was quite cold after the flight, so I'd like to be quite sure. Especially the cheese was really expensive and freezing it would very likely demage it.</p>  <p>Usually I pack everything well in clothes, but this time the things are just too many so it's tough to do more than just protect the wine from breaking.</p>  <p>Some details: It's an A320 flight taking 1.5 hours, with Czech Airlines, from Paris CDG to Prague PRG.</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
14054	Do I need a Turkey transit visa for a layover?	<p>I have an Indian passport and am planning to visit Germany with a valid visa. To book a flight for Germany (Mumbai – Dusseldorf), I came across some connected flights that stop at Istanbul.</p>  <p>Do I need to have visa for Turkey?  This is the first time I am travelling outside my country, and any information on this will be helpful.</p> 
31146	Can we carry three new smart phones in hand luggage to India?	<p>I bought two smart phones for my father and sister in Europe. Will the customs officer in India (Chennai) give any trouble if I carry two new unopened smart phones with the box in my hand luggage? Also, i'm a student, does this give me any advantage over it?</p> 
39111	UK visa decision advice?	<p>I have recently been refused visa entry clearance into the UK after applying for a 6 months visa based on failure to include criminality or state reasons for different alias used in UK previously.</p>  <p>Also I have stayed 112 days significantly more than a month stated in the duration of stay on my first successful application but I returned back before my six-month visa expired and have not stated reasons why I stayed that long or how I met my financial requirement while in the UK.</p>  <p>Finally I failed to include supporting documents of financial, assets or savings of family member with whom I reside in my country.</p>  <p>Based on all of these decisions I wish to reapply as soon as possible having written a letter I wish to include addressing all the decision as well as the financial statements which I failed to provide?</p>  <p>I am now wondering is there a likely chance I would be successful on the new application if sent or should I not apply soon due to fear of ban?</p> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p> 
24160	Multiple visits to USA	<p>I have visited Los Angeles, USA on 3 long stays using the ESTA programme, purely as a visitor. I have a British Citizen passport. The stays began in September 2012 and I left the last time in August 2013. My stays were for 79-85 days each time. My quandary is because I was stopped the last time I entered the US in May 2013 on the 3rd of these visits as they were so frequent, but they still did not deny me entry.   I was advised by the Transit Authority Officer at the airport that I should leave "6 months or even better a year" after returning home to the UK, before returning again last August, or to obtain, a Visitors visa for the next times.  They said that I'd "abused" the ESTA, although still granting me entry.  I had used 2 ESTAS in these 3 visits. There was 32 days and then 7 weeks or so between visits back home in London.   </p>  <p>I would like to visit there again, this February, but because of the above, I cannot tell if I would be allowed in to the country.  I know it'd be better to wait until this August, then after a year, but I'd prefer to go now and would try to obtain the visitors visa, if only I could be more sure of entry.  I'd also like to stay longer than 3 months as well if I obtain a visitors visa successfully.  So, if I tried to enter the USA this February, with a visitors visa do you think I'd be allowed entry? </p> 
4839	Computer geek tourist attractions in the San Francisco Bay Area & Silicon Valley?	<p>We're planning a family vacation to the San Francisco Bay Area &amp; Silicon Valley, and one of the highlights I don't want to miss is the <a href="http://computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a>.  However, I didn't find that listed in the free guides we got from our auto club.  So:</p>  <ol> <li>What other definitive "computer geek" attractions should we consider on our trip to the area?</li> <li>Are there any area travel guidebooks for folks interested in computing and its history?</li> <li>What other resources, online or otherwise, should we have a look at?</li> </ol> 
38844	Visiting software development companies in LA area/Silicon Valley	<p>I'm a norwegian, headed for the 2015 CES show in Las Vegas in january. We're landing at LAX and we're renting a car. I'm VERY interested in software, hardware and everything that has to do with computers, phones, tablets, etc.</p>  <p>I was wondering if there was a few companies that develop software - for instance games, apps, desktop software, etc that there might be a chance we could visit?</p>  <p>I've been mailing Activision and DICE but I couldn't find an email address to Activision and DICE has yet to answer.</p>  <p>It would be of huge help if you can list the companies you know in LA, Silicon Valley or between those two.</p> 
31379	Why is the British passport the most valuable despite colonization?	<p>I was checking out Wikipedia and I could see a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_British_citizens" rel="nofollow">British passport entitles to visa-free or visa-on-arrival for 173 countries</a> despite colonization by the British. While USA ranks 2nd with 172 countries. I am not sure if this is the right forum to ask, but can anyone explain me? (let me know if this is a question that belongs here before downvoting)</p>

13867	Can I cross the USA-Canada border with a birth certificate and a passport locator number?	<p>My US passport took too long to be shipped to me, and it will arrive after I need to leave. Will I be able to cross the border from the United States to Canada with a birth certificate (copy) and a passport locator number?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
38888	What exactly does "nights" means when you book? Is it number of night you are going to sleep, or simply days you are going to stay?	<p>For example, suppose that I'm going to travel London and will arrive at 10am, 1st December. And will stay a week, means will leave 10am, 8th December. Technically it's 7 nights, but also 8 days. Should I book 7 counts(nights) or 8 counts?</p> 
24666	Do US citizens need a visa for transit in Frankfurt?	<p>I am a US citizen.  I have a transit in Frankfurt for 12 and half hours. I will fly from Detroit to Frankfurt then to Amman, Jordan.

39153	UK visa refusal	<p>I have applied recently for a general visitor visa to the UK to spend 10 days during Christmas with my British unmarried partner and it has been turned down. </p>  <p>The Entry Clearance Officer stated on his refusal notice the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I note that you have never previously travelled to the UK or any country with similar immigration requirements and you therefore do not have a history of travel and compliance to consider.</p>      <p>You have submitted an employment letter to confirm your occupation in KSA but I am required to also assess your personal, domestic and economic circumstances in determining whether you are genuine visitor travelling to the UK for the period and purpose you state.</p>      <p>You claim an income of SAR ........ per month which equal ........ GBP and from the evidence submitted this appears to be your sole source of income.   I note that this monthly income is reflected on your bank statements. However, the bank statement you have presented show a recent large deposit that are in excess of your stated income and inconsistent with the account history. You haven't provided evidence toward the origin of this recent deposit and in the absence of reasonable evidence I am not satisfied that these bank statements accurately reflect your personal circumstances.</p>      <p>In view of the above, I am not satisfied you have demonstrated that your circumstances are as you claim and therefore I am not satisfied that you're travelling to the UK for the period and purpose you stated. 41(i)and(ii).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Its true that I have deposited that sum of money right before I apply and it was a commission I received from work earlier this month. </p>  <p>So, could you please give me your advice on the above as I am planning to apply again soon. and how to avoid my application being refused again? </p> 
16960	How to get from Heathrow Airport to King's Cross, London?	<p>My wife and I will be arriving in London via Heathrow Airport (LHR) and are staying at a hotel near King's Cross station. So, we were wondering what the best (which means fastest but also easiest when carrying two large pieces of luggage and two carry-ons) way to get from LHR to King's Cross?</p>  <p>I gather that, with only one changeover, we can take the Tube. However, in the interest of other passengers, we thought it would be best to take a taxi, or maybe a bus?</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p> 
29142	How to prepare parents for B2 VISA interview?	<p>I am living in USA with H1B VISA. My parents are in India. We ave applied B2 VISA for my parents and scheduled Interview. However my mother is not educated and my father is went to only high school. For them the names of cities, employers are worked are very new and they can not pronounce properly. And they don’t know all the visa related process and stuff also not proper. And also they use more dialects, slang and words which is very local to our native place and not a kind of text book language. </p>  <p>At this situation, I am little skeptical about their success in the VISA interview. How can I best prepare them for the VISA interview and what are the best tips and advices that I can give them?</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p>

23692	Travel site that found the lowest-price tickets from your current location	<p>Some time ago I had a bookmark to an awesome travel site, which I've lost. I'm hoping someone else used it.  The site was very minimal. You told it where you currently are, and it showed you the cheapest flights either in the next three days, or the whole month, from your current city. Ie, you didn't specify where you wanted to <em>go</em>, you specified where you <em>were</em>, and it told you where you could go.</p>  <p>If it helps narrow it down, I remember the website had a rotating set of background photos of various places, and the UI was very minimal and sat in a small rounded rectangle in the screen center.</p>  <p>Ie, the UI was a nice photo, and then in the very center of the screen, a small rounded-rectangle for search and results.  It was very distinctive.</p>  <p>It was a nice approach to travel planning, leading to spontaneous trips, quite unlike all other search sites I've used, and I'd like to find it again.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>This question is not a duplicate of "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/730/how-can-i-do-a-broad-search-for-flights">How can I do a broad search for flights?</a>"</strong> I am not looking for a general broad search   engine. I am seeking a <em>specific travel/search site</em> with <em>specific   and unusual functionality</em> that is <em>more specific than in that   question</em> and is <em>not answered by any answers in that question.</em></p>      <p>I hate to sound snippy, but this should have been obvious from reading   both questions.  (For example, where in that question does it mention the site I'm looking for? I'll answer: it doesn't. This specific site had functionality unlike any other site that I know of, and better than those mentioned in the other question.) This specific site did some cool stuff, which is why I ant to find this one, not a common, well-known one. Please reopen, and <strong>please read</strong> both questions and   answers to verify this, as I believe you should have before closing.</p> </blockquote> 
27559	Is there a guarantee that flightfox.com will be cheaper than other booking methods?	<p>Recently, I tried to use flightfox, as I have read that they are much cheaper than other websites. Before proceeding with my booking however, I was faced by the fact that I had to pay a $49 fee before even seeing any flight options.</p>  <p>Is there a guarantee that flighfox will be cheaper than other services, and that I will end up saving more than what I will pay as a fee for the service?</p>

39104	Would uncooked bacon go bad in a transatlantic flight?	<p>I am going to have a transatlantic flight (Canada-Italy-Turkey) and would like to bring uncooked bacon with me (standard packaged bacon from a supermarket). I will be carrying it in my luggage that I check in.</p>  <p>Would it go bad during the travel (between the time I check in and get my luggage) or would there be any other issue with it? Especially at Italy where I make a connection.</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
10160	Paying with Euro in Czech Republic	<p>I'm traveling to Prague and I want to know where I can pay with euros (<code>EUR</code>) and where I have to pay with Czech korunas (<code>CZK</code>). I'm going to Prague's stadium to watch a football match and I know I can buy the tickets for that with <code>EUR</code>, but what about freeway tolls, hostels, restaurants, public transport and museums?</p> 
37926	Dual Citizen entering EU with foreign passport	<p>I'm a Canadian citizen, and I have a girlfriend (and the start of a new life) waiting for me in France. I have returned to Canada to acquire my Portuguese nationality and am awaiting the documentation asserting that I am now a Portuguese citizen. With this, I will be able to live and work in France until I am ready to marry. Here are the facts followed by my question:</p>  <ul> <li>I visited France at the beginning of July 2014.</li> <li>I stayed for a total of 80 days of the 90/180 Schengen rule.</li> <li>After I receive my Portuguese citizenship, I will have to wait for another 1.5 months before receiving my identity card and Portuguese passport </li> </ul>  <p>I have already been away from my girlfriend and "life" more than I'd care to be, and it's also financially draining. Here is my question:</p>  <ul> <li>Once I receive the documentation stating that I am a Portuguese citizen, can I return to France on my Canadian passport?</li> <li>Would the 90/180 rule apply to me since I entered on the Canadian passport?</li> <li>If I entered on my Canadian passport, would I have to leave on it the next time I fly out of Europe?  <ul> <li>If I did, would it count as overstaying?</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>I'm not worried about getting the citizen card or passport, because I could apply for those at the Portuguese embassy in France.</p>  <p>Thank you in advance, so much, for any replies and advice you may offer!</p>

36027	Airline compensation for failure to check visa eligibility?	<p>Asking from Australia and about Malaysian Airlines specifically: </p>  <p>How good a case is it to seek compensation for flights if the airline failed to check documentation correctly and let us board in the first place? </p>  <p>My partner and I boarded a flight to a destination for which, it turned out, he was unable to gain a visa-upon-entry into (Australian travel document, Thailand). </p>  <p>We were subsequently put on a flight back to Australia of which we were told we were 'covered' by our return flight fees. In short, we essentially lost the return fees in full, and incurred additional costs from an airport hotel overnight due to flight connection times.</p>  <p>Is this something that could've been avoided if the airline had checked the validity of the travel document in the first place, so that we could have at least remained at home and claimed a refund for the return leg of the journey? </p>  <p>What is the best way to go about addressing this issue?</p>

37658	What are some in-flight features and are there smoking areas in airports?	<p>I am new at this site so I might not be the best at explaining what question I am asking. </p>  <p>First off, I'll tell you what flight/seats I am on: I'm flying with united 1. Airbus A320-seat 7C 2. Canadair regional jet 700- seat 18B 3. Bombarder Q400- seat 7B 4. Boeing 737-900-seat 8D</p>  <p>I do have fear of flight so I do like to keep myself busy. A few questions I have are: Is there any wifi (because I know some planes have that), also are cellphones allowed to be used/turned on in a plane? Are you able to use your computer, and last but not least are there plug ins to plug a device in to charge it? </p>  <p>Another part of this post is that I am a smoker. I will be leaving from Seattle airport, having a lay over in San Francisco and then going to Oklahoma. On the way back I have a lay over in Denver. In any of these airports are there smoking areas to go outside or anything, or do I have to go all the way to the entrance and before my flight go threw customs again just to have a smoke?</p> 
35002	Can e-cigarettes / vaping set off smoke detectors?	<p>I work in a backpacker hostel in Australia. Of course smoking is not allowed inside the building and there are smoke detectors in every room and corridor.</p>  <p>By law in Australia the smoke detectors set off a fire alarm which we are not permitted to turn off and the fire department is automatically notified. The entire hostel must be evacuated until they arrive and only they are permitted to turn off the alarm. Even in the middle of the night and bad weather. The charge for a false alarm is nearing $1,000.</p>  <p>A couple of weeks ago I saw for the first time a guest "vaping" an e-cigarette. It emits a vapour that looks similar to cigarette smoke. He told me that it's fine to use these things in doors.</p>  <p>But I wonder, do smoke detectors specifically and only detect smoke particles? Is there zero possibility that e-cigarette vapour could ever set off a smoke detector?</p> 
20085	Indian Visa in expired passport, new passport with husband's surname	<p>I have an Indian visa valid till 2013 in my old passport.

35803	Gifts for Chinese hosts?	<p>I am traveling to China for work (I am an academic), and would like to bring small gifts with me for the hosts who have been working to coordinate my visit. What are some recommendations for the kinds of gifts which Chinese people would appreciate?</p> 
3356	How big is "too big" for an airline seat? At what point will you be required to buy two tickets?	<p>As I said in another question, I'm bringing my parents to visit me here in Sweden next year.</p>  <p>My mother is around 280-300 pounds and 5'6" (130-135kg, 1.67m). I am concerned that she might be asked at the airport to buy a second seat. If it's likely I would rather just buy the second seat in advance, because I don't want her to be embarassed/humiliated by some random employee. As well, I won't be there, they will be travelling alone and aren't used to dealing with airports and they won't know what their rights are.</p>  <p>In terms of how it will affect other passengers, it's not important, she will get a window seat and my dad will sit in the middle seat, so I don't see it affecting anybody. </p>  <p>She insists it's fine, "the last time I flew I fit easily!" but that was 20 years ago when she was half the size. </p>  <p>They will be flying BA or SAS, definitely not Ryanair.</p>  <p>So - where is the cutoff? Is a 300 pound 5'6" woman going to be too big to fit in a single airline seat? Or am I worrying about nothing?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
38706	Which are the non Schengen countries that allow entry from a Schengen country?	<p>There are countries in the Balkan area that allow entry if you have a Schengen visa but am not able find a definite list of all those countries. Knowing that will save me getting a visa for all those countries when I do my mega Euro trip.</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
39410	Driving from El Calafate to Torres del Paine National Park and back?	<p>I will be traveling to Patagonia in January with few friends and wanted to know if I could drive to Torres del Paine.</p>  <p>Specifically, we were thinking of:</p>  <ol> <li>Renting a car in El Calafate</li> <li>Driving to Torres del Paine</li> <li>Parking in Torres del Paine while we hike the 'W' trail</li> <li>Driving back to El Calafate.</li> </ol>  <p>Any advice would be appreciated. Though I guess, I am most concerned about whether it is possible (or safe) to park somewhere in Torres del Paine, and whether we will run into trouble crossing the Argentina-Chile border.</p> 
9646	Does a multiple-entry Schengen visa allow visiting other Schengen countries later, without going via the issuing country?	<p>My wife was just issued a multiple entry visa by France, which is good for one year.  Our first trip will be to France, the issuing country.  My question is: after we leave the EU and return, must future trips also start in France? Or may we go directly to (say) Greece from the US on a later visit?</p>

38786	Trekking near Addis Ababa, where can one do it?	<p>I would like to do some trekking near Addis Ababa. I googled for it and the only things I found were 10 day hikes, provided by some local companies. Unfortunatly I don't have that kind of time.</p>  <p>Are there places around Addis Ababa where one can do a one day trekking? I would prefer that you can  do it by yourself (arrive to the place and do the trail without a guide).</p> 
22113	Is it possible to check Hong Kong duty free prices for alcohol online?	<p>On an upcoming trip, I'm flying from London to Hong Kong, spending a few days there, then carrying onwards to Australia. I've generally found the arrivals duty free stores in Australia to be fairly poor value, so I'm therefore planning to buy things before I arrive.</p>  <p>One option is to buy things in Heathrow, then <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10957/how-can-you-protect-a-fragile-object-like-bottle-of-champagne-in-your-baggage-ag">pack it in my suitcase</a> while in Hong Kong, before flying on. The other is to buy things in Hong Kong before boarding my flight.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.worlddutyfree.com/" rel="nofollow">Heathrow duty free website</a> isn't great, but it does manage to list the prices of many of the things they sell (but by no means all, or least not that I can find...) Fine for getting an idea though of prices, and pretty good on their special offers.</p>  <p>I've looked in the <a href="http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/shopping/insideshopping/all/dutyf/list.html" rel="nofollow">Duty Free section of the Hong Kong airport</a> website, which lists where the duty free shops are, but I can't seem to spot prices either there or linked from there. Since I'll be in HK second, if I discover Heathrow was cheaper it'll be too late...</p>  <p>Is it possible to check the rough or exact prices of duty free alcohol in the Hong Kong airport online? Or failing that, does anyone know roughly how prices compare with somewhere like Heathrow?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p>

22527	Which locations are traditionally Santa's home - i.e. where can you visit Santa Claus year-round?	<p>Obviously around this time of the year, Santa and his minions will be out and about, finding out who is naughty and nice, and delivering presents.</p>  <p>However, the rest of the year he's back at his home.  Where is that generally considered to be visitable?</p>  <p>Yes, in some traditions it's the 'North Pole', but I know at least one other country (Finland) has Rovaniemi as his home.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QGGQ7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:20121123_SantaClaus-Chicago.JPG">Image source: Wikipedia</a></p>

I know what a stateless person is after I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness">this wikipedia page</a> but I could not find how do stateless people travel? if stateless people have no nationality then logically they have no passport.. if they do not have passport how do stateless people travel? </p> 
34497	What historic sights can I see in Oslo on a 4 hour train layover?	<p>During my journey through Norway at the end of August I'll have a 4 hour layover in Oslo. My train arrives on 07:04 at Oslo sentralstasjon and the train departs on 11:01 from the same station. This is on a Tuesday.</p>  <p>I've never been to Oslo before and was wondering if I could do some sightseeing in this short time. I'll probably leave my luggage in the lockers so I'll have more mobility.</p>  <p>I would want to avoid using public transport for more than a few stops as that might result in a delay and missing my train, so preferably the sights should be within 1 hour walking distance of the train station.<br> Shops/malls and the like are mostly the same across Europe so I am not interested in those. </p>  <p>I am interested in historical sites and buildings that can be found in Oslo.  Also a nice quiet vantage point from which I can overlook the city and eat some breakfast would be fantastic, but I'm not sure if that exists.</p>

34046	Searching for internal bus connections in Germany	<p>How to search for internal bus connections in Germany, for example between Munich and Berlin?</p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8458/cheap-bus-lines-in-germany-something-like-orangeways">The question on Travel.SE about cheap bus lines</a> gives many bus companies that offer inter-Germany bus connections. So if I'd like to find best connection for me (which could be by price, but as well by the departure/arrival hour) I'd have to go to all of the sites and check.</p>  <p>Are there some aggregating sites for Germany, where I can find all connections from all companies for given route?

33896	How to find inter-country buses in Europe?	<p>I was traveling from Zurich to Frankfurt, and when I asked a tourist information, the guy advised that the best way is train. I took the train, and when arrived in Frankfurt, I found that there is a German company having bus from Zurich to Frankfurt with 1/3 of the train price.</p>  <p>The problem is that bus companies are small and not-connected. On the other hand, such small companies have website mainly in their local languages (not English). As a result, it is difficult for a foreigner to find the best option for bus from a country to another; particularly, as they operate from small stations rather than a big united terminal (as one can go and ask for options).</p>  <p>Are there resources (e.g., websites) for searching all bus routes around Europe?</p> 
38606	Traveling from Paris to Düsseldorf	<p>What is the cheapest way to travel from Paris to Düsseldorf?  I'm flying into Paris via Ryanair from Rome, but there are no Ryanair flights from Paris to Düsseldorf (or anywhere near western Germany, for that matter) and I have yet to find a good train route.  I'd like to avoid flying the main airlines and I need to make this trip this upcoming Monday, 17.11.2014.</p>  <p><strong>Has anyone made this trip before or have advice on getting from Paris to somewhere near western Germany?</strong></p> 
34818	Why is security screening done at the gate at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam) in the non-Schengen area?	<p>I've noticed that when taking non-Schengen flights at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam), there is no centralized security check after you enter the airport and go through passport control. Instead, the security check happens right at the gate. The security checkpoint opens about an hour before the flight departs from that gate. This system seems to have a huge number of disadvantages:</p>  <ul> <li>It must be really expensive - there's an X-ray machine, metal detectors, and for some gates even millimeter wave scanners at <em>each</em> gate. </li> <li>Also, adding to the expense, there are washrooms at <em>each</em> gate, since passengers can no longer use the common area washrooms after passing through security.</li> <li>It's really inconvenient for the passengers. There's no way to reach the seats inside the gate area before the security checkpoint opens, so people are forced to either wait far away in other areas of the airport, or (as I've seen many people do) sit on the floor, which is especially a problem for the elderly, etc.</li> <li>The security lineup tends to be very long, since all of a sudden an entire plane-full of people tries to pass through a checkpoint with very limited equipment (i.e. usually just 1 x-ray machine)</li> <li>Once inside the area, it's essentially an entire plane-full of people in a small area with no way to spread out, so there's always a shortage of seats</li> <li>There's no way to buy e.g. a bottle of water (not to mention duty-free alcohol) in the secure area of the airport and bring it onto the plane, something that is generally allowed in typical airports</li> <li>Security screening personnel must roam around the airport from gate to gate</li> </ul>  <p>I can think of only one advantage of this system: Arriving flights from non-Schengen countries (whose passengers must be re-screened for security) can just let people out of the plane through the gate - there's no need to "route" them through the secure area to a non-secure area, since everything is essentially a non-secure area. But surely this could have been solved at the airport design stage, as it is solved in many airports worldwide? Is this just a design oversight or a conscious decision? Are there other reasons to use such a system that I'm not thinking of? Is this typical in other European airports?</p>

1319	Can I use B1/B2 visa to travel to the US without a business purpose?	<p>I got a <strong>B1/B2</strong> visa earlier this year when I traveled to the US for a business trip from my company.<br> It expires in 2013 and I'd love to visit the United States again, but for no other purpose than traveling.</p>  <p>I wonder:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>If I can legally travel to US with B1/B2 visa without a real business need (assuming I'm honest);</li>   <li>If I have to work at my current company to be able to use it.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>I live in Russia.</p>

35469	How/where to buy mixed-class tickets for a flight?	<p>I want to buy two business class tickets, and two coach - for the same flights. So far every site I saw allows me to pick tickets in single class only, so I'd have to buy them separately, which causes problems, as not all flights seem to be available in both business and coach.</p>  <p>The reason behind my request is that I want to couch tickets for kids, and two business for me and my wife.</p>  <p>Is there any trick to make purchasing such tickets easier? Or perhaps there is some site that caters to such family needs?</p> 
34243	Pricing and booking mixed-class fares, with economy & premium economy combined?	<p>So I find myself flying mixed-class fares pretty often these days, with the long legs in Premium Economy and the short hauls in plain old Economy.  Some sample trips flown or planned:</p>  <ol> <li>SYD-AKL-SFO (NZ), with SYD-AKL in Economy and AKL-SFO in Prem Econ</li> <li>SYD-SFO-LAS (UA), with SYD-SFO in Economy Plus and SFO-LAS in Economy</li> <li>ZRH-DXB-SYD (EK/QF), with ZRH-DXB in EK Economy and DXB-SYD in QF Prem Eco</li> </ol>  <p>Problem is, none of the booking engines I know handle this.  For example, if I select "Premium Economy" in my usual favorite, <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/">ITA Matrix</a>, it interprets this as "must fly in prem eco <em>or better</em>" and thus doesn't find #1 at all, instead offering $9,000 fares via Hong Kong or something (because there's no Prem Eco for SYD-AKL), and for #2 it quotes me SFO-LAS in First.  None of the airline sites listed above seem to cater to this either, except -- oddly enough -- for award redemptions.  I usually end up getting quotes for plain old economy and asking actual human travel agents how much an upgrade would cost, but this is slow and inconvenient for everybody involved.</p>  <p><strong>So is there a booking engine that lets me specify "fly in premium economy if you can, but economy if not"?</strong></p> 
38120	Get to Schiphol early in the day/sleep at airport?	<p>I will depart from Schiphol on a Sunday at 10:00, and return on some other day at 05:00. What options do I have to travel to/from Schiphol Airport?</p>  <ul> <li>I'd prefer the train, but if I am not mistaken, the first connection from Heerlen will arrive on 09:56, so this is no option.</li> <li>I could take the car, parking for two weeks is 100€. But I will have to drive back after a night in the plane, possibly without sleep. So, no option either, I guess.</li> <li>Third option is to try to get a hotel room. Best rates I found are 150€ per night. Any tips on that?</li> <li>The last night train arrives 04:00. Since I will travel with my sleeping bag could I just take a nap somewhere near/at the airport?</li> </ul> 
39681	Clarification on UK Visitor Rules Paragraph 41 and the Schengen cooling off period	<p>This question concerns tourists and 'visitors' only, it is not about those seeking long-term migration strategies.</p>  <p>The rule is Paragraph 41 concerning visitors.  The clause is (ii), and in 2014 this clause was expanded to include this text...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>and does not intend to live for extended periods in the United Kingdom   through frequent or successive visits; and</p> </blockquote>  <p>This new text is clearly directed at something.  But what?  Juxtaposed to this rule, there is a Schengen rule that requires a visitor to undergo a cooling off period such that the rolling 90 days out of 180 days is not violated.  Because the UK qualifies as a place where a person can spend their Schengen cooling off period and the UK is adjacent to the Schengen zone, visitors may be attracted to that strategy.</p>  <p>Related question <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/39649/us-citizen-90-180-schengen-stay-bilateral-agreements-w-poland-denmark-etc/39652#39652">US Citizen: 90/180 Schengen Stay &amp; Bilateral Agreements w/Poland, Denmark, etc</a></p>  <p>Surely the rule is worded to cover a lot of 'grey areas' that the authorities see as borderline abuse, such as digital nomads who work on foreign-based contracts, and people who are attempting to qualify for residency under Article 8, and people who might be visiting the UK a lot because they are traffickers or drug dealers. It probably also covers people who are conducting long-distance relationships because such people are not bona fide visitors along with people who frequently come and go with no apparent reason who are also not considered to be bona fide visitors.  </p>  <p>I'm not asking if you agree with the rule, or if you think the rule will be effective; I am happy to take it as read that the rule exists and will be enforced until Parliament or the courts change it.</p>  <p>Would this new rule affect people who habitually use the UK as a place to reset their Schengen clock?  If so, how would they be affected, and why doesn't the rule explicitly say <em>'Schengen' cooling off period</em>? Is there a possibility that they would be refused entry? Or have their leave to enter shortened?  How many times can a person make successive visits before this happens?</p>  <p>The rule itself is here <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381797/Immigration_Rules_-_Part_2_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381797/Immigration_Rules_-_Part_2_final.pdf</a></p> 
39649	US Citizen: 90/180 Schengen Stay & Bilateral Agreements w/Poland, Denmark, etc	<p>I'm a US citizen on an extended trip in Europe. So far, I've been very careful with the 90/180 rule. At no point in any 180 days have I stayed more than 90 days in the Schengen area; my "gap months" were spent in the UK and Croatia.</p>  <p>The end of another 90-day period is upon me, and I was planning to take a trip to Ireland. However, I recently learned that a few countries — Denmark, Poland, maybe France — might possibly have bilateral agreements with the US that let you stay 90 days passport-free, independent of any other Schengen area visits.</p>  <p>This is very appealing to me, since I really wanted to visit Poland and/or Denmark anyway. I'd much rather go to those countries than Ireland. However, the information about these agreements is <em>extremely sketchy</em>, at best. For the most part, it's people on travel forums quoting snippets of law and talking about how they weren't caught when they crossed the border. If a border guard confronts me, I do not, under any circumstance, want to run into a situation where I can get banned from the Eurozone!</p>  <p>On the other hand, the New to Denmark website (billed as "the official portal for foreigners") <a href="http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/visa/Visa_free_travel.htm" rel="nofollow">quite clearly states</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Citizens of Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, New   Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the US can freely enter and stay   in Denmark for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, regardless of   whether they have stayed in another Schengen country prior to entry   into Denmark. The 90 days are counted from the entry date into Denmark   or another Nordic country. If you have previously spent time in   Denmark or another Nordic country within the previous 180 days, that   time will be deducted from the 90-day maximum.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I guess my questions are as follows:</p>  <ol> <li>Are these rumors of bilateral agreements independent of the Schengen passport-free period true? Or has it just been instances of border guards being nice?</li> <li>Is the quoted statement above an official document that I can use as a reference?</li> <li>Does a similar statement exist somewhere for Poland (or France, if valid)?</li> <li>Why does the statement mention "another Nordic country"? Is this bilateral agreement with just Denmark, or does it include other Nordic countries as well?</li> <li>If I follow through with this and decide to go to one of these countries, how can I get official verification of the additional 90-day period? The Schengen area doesn't have border checks, after all; there won't be any official proof that I entered Denmark/Poland/France on a certain date.</li> <li>Do I have to do something to "activate" this extended stay?</li> <li>Does the 90-day Schengen period get put on hold while I'm in one of these bilateral countries, or is it still active? That is, if I spend 90 days in Schengen and then another 90 days in Poland, am I free to go back to Schengen for another 90 days? Or does the Schengen clock stop while I'm in Poland?</li> </ol>  <p>To clarify, I'm not looking to make a "border run", but to stay in one of these countries for a few months.</p>

30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
11047	Can we get a new visa waiver in Canada, for Alaska, when our old one expires in the US?	<p>We are UK citizens driving from Patagonia to Alaska, then shipping home from New York. We hope to be in the US for 3 months, a couple of months in Canada then into Alaska for a couple of  months and then back into Canada and the US. But cannot find information about whether we can get a new visa waiver in Canada for driving to Alaska and then back into the US?</p> 
17258	How can I accurately estimate the weight of my luggage?	<p>This is somewhat of a problem for me.  Sometimes, when I'm packed up and getting ready to move, I find that I have no reliable way to weigh my own luggage.</p>  <p>Of course, most of us know that airlines nowadays usually have heavy restrictions on luggage, including size, type, but mostly, weight.</p>  <p>How should I accurately estimate the weight of my lugagge then? It seems that the norm for most airlines is 50lbs per luggage, but how can I tell whether or not something is below, equal, or above that imposed limit?  </p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
4839	Computer geek tourist attractions in the San Francisco Bay Area & Silicon Valley?	<p>We're planning a family vacation to the San Francisco Bay Area &amp; Silicon Valley, and one of the highlights I don't want to miss is the <a href="http://computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a>.  However, I didn't find that listed in the free guides we got from our auto club.  So:</p>  <ol> <li>What other definitive "computer geek" attractions should we consider on our trip to the area?</li> <li>Are there any area travel guidebooks for folks interested in computing and its history?</li> <li>What other resources, online or otherwise, should we have a look at?</li> </ol> 
27143	Which countries count for the 90-day limit in the US Visa Waiver Program?	<p>What are all the ineligible countries that do not restart the 90-day Visa Waiver into the USA?</p> 
37354	How do custom officers determine if the imported goods of a passenger are old or newly bought?	<p>Almost all countries levy custom duties (with an allowance) on imported goods by passengers, such as electronics, clothes, etc., that have been bought from outside that country and are intended to stay there.</p>  <p>I am an EU citizen (Germany), and once when flying in from a non-EU country I was stopped by a customs officer who thoroughly checked my bag. I had a few new shirts and shoes (with removed labels), and they didn't ask anything, even though the apparel was obviously never worn. The value was around the tax-free €430 allowance, or it was even exceeded.</p>  <p>However, another time I was in an opposite situation when I was not bringing anything new. I had a hard time explaining that my camera and clothes are not so new, and have been bought in Germany/EU, and not during my trip outside the EU.</p>  <p>Can someone explain how does this work? How do custom officers determine if the imported goods of a passenger are old or newly bought? How do passengers prove that they did not buy the goods during the trip? Since people do not carry receipts of all the things they have with them, I don't see how it would be possible to prove that something fairly new was not bought during the trip.</p>  <p>It is not unknown that many people tend to remove the packaging and/or tags of new goods to conceal that the goods are being imported, but there are also people who travel with new goods which have been bought shortly before the trip. How do customs officers distinguish the two?</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
31091	Can I drive in North-Carolina with a EU drivers license?	<p>In an entry to travel.se on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/31062/do-usa-states-have-reciprocal-agreements-for-learner-drivers-permits">reciprocal agreements for learner drivers</a>, it is mentioned that in North Carolina:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The International Drivers License is NOT recognized in North Carolina and cannot be used as a drivers license.</p> </blockquote>  <p>On the referred <a href="https://www.ncdps.gov/index2.cfm?a=000003,000014,000935,000944" rel="nofollow">page</a> it is however stated that </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Residents from other states or countries may operate vehicles in North Carolina using their drivers licenses. The same restrictions or limitations as imposed by their home states or countries apply in North Carolina.</p> </blockquote>  <p>These two lines do however contradict each other since a local drivers license always is an intrinsic part of a International Drivers License. </p>  <p>What is the rationale behind denying IDP's and allowing local, foreign, drivers licenses. Also the use of the word "may" in "Residents from other states or countries may operate vehicles" is confusing.</p>  <p>So with an EU drivers license, can I or can't I drive in North Carolina?</p> 
19734	Is Greek driver's license valid in the US?	<p>I was searching for info about the need of updating my Greek driver's license to international, but I can't get a clear answer about whether it's needed for use in the US. A friend told me that he's recently rented a car in the US with his Greek license and he never had a problem. Does anyone know for sure? </p> 
17580	Other public transport from Rotterdam Central Station to Europort	<p>"Other public transport is possible, but will take you 3.5 hours". Bart Arondson mentioned this possibility for getting from Rotterdam Central to the Europort on 24th February <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13900/best-way-from-central-rotterdam-to-europoort/13903#13903">as an answer to a previous question</a>. Does anybody know what other possibility he meant? We need to travel with a small dog in the pet carrier and P&amp;O Shuttle bus doesn´t allow any pets. Normal taxi for two of us would be too expensive. Could you advice us please? We have plenty of time to get there, so we don´t mind if it takes a bit longer.</p> 
39814	Online resource for finding co-working space while traveling	<p>We have a number of questions about finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking" rel="nofollow">coworking</a> space in a number of cities. I'm interested in a general resource for finding such places. This may make my question too broad and/or a list question.  My ideal resource would allow searching for cafes/co-working space in a particular city/neighborhood, and would provide for reviews.</p> 
39821	Online resource for finding cafes/wifi hotspots for working while traveling	<p>Similar to my question asking about <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/39814/444">coworking spaces</a>, are there any online resources for finding more temporary work spaces? Specifically, cafés, restaurants, wifi hotspots, etc?</p>  <ul> <li>Internet connectivity <ul> <li>Reliability</li> <li>Session limits, if any</li> <li>Security type (WPA2? Open/unencrypted? etc)</li> <li>Any restrictions (ports other than 80 blocked? Transparent proxy? etc)</li> </ul></li> <li>Availability of electrical outlets</li> <li>Type of environment <ul> <li>Tables with chairs vs sofas/lounge area, etc</li> <li>Music/noise type/level</li> </ul></li> <li>Food/drink menu and price (if applicable)</li> </ul>  <p>Many resources allow public reviews which may contain some or all of this information, but I've yet to find one which actually makes it easy to see this information without just reading through dozens or hundreds of reviews. TripAdvisor, Urban Spoon, Yelp, even Google maps are candidates.</p>  <p>Some of these even mention if wifi is available, but rarely, if ever, mention some aspects of wifi connectivity important to professionals, such as session limits, or if certain ports are blocked. And I've never seen a resource which mentions the availability of electrical outlets.</p>  <p>But is there a wifi indexing site somewhere?</p> 
7628	Can you actually do a road-trip in Greenland?	<p>There is of course the epic Top Gear episode where they went for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNkvASxfEWQ" rel="nofollow">North Pole</a>. </p>  <p>I came across this short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr47w7Tz5-U" rel="nofollow">youtube</a> film on some driving the only "freeway" in Greenland. It seems you can drive on Greenland if you are not supported by a television network. Google maps don't show a road map. </p>  <p>So can I do a road-trip in Greenland and where do I need to go? </p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
2038	Driving from US to Central America	<p>Is it possible to drive from the US through Mexico to Central America? What route is recommended, and how long would it take? What safety or immigration/customs concerns would you face?</p> 
1815	Driving from San Antonio to Copan Ruinas, Honduras	<p>I and some friends are taking our vehicles from the US to Honduras. Once we get to Honduras, we're golden. However, navigating the space between San Antonio and Copan Ruinas is tricky. I need some guidance on a route. Which borders should I cross. Which cities should I stay in overnight? Which roads should I take?</p> 
4393	Comparative safety of countries in Central America	<p>When considering general safety for travelers visiting a foreign country, how do the Central American countries compare (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama)? Are some significantly more safe or dangerous than others, or are they all in similar situations? </p> 
21004	Can I get a Schengen visa after being deported from the UK 3 years ago?	<p>I'm an Indian national. I was holding a Tier 4 students visa in UK for 2009 to mid of 2011. I was removed to India on working excess of permitted hours, a breach of section 10(1)(a) of the immigration Act 1999 of UK and an offence under section 24(1)(b)(ii) of the immigration Act 1971 of UK. I was served papers IS151A, IS151A part 2, IS91R and been removed by the end of 2010.</p>  <ol> <li>Will I now have any trouble getting a Schengen visa? </li> <li>What possible steps can I take now to pursue a Schengen visa?</li> <li>Is it true that I am still banned from entering into any countries in the world?</li> </ol> 
25845	Is Morocco currently safe to visit despite the Ebola outbreak?	<p>I'm travelling to Morocco over the Easter period, and while I am aware that the current Ebola outbreak is mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Mali, and would have to cross the Sahara to get to Morocco, is it wise for me to go to Morocco at this time?</p>  <p>What are some basic precautions I can take in the case that the Ebola virus travels to Morocco?</p> 
4397	Why does the TSA allow two 3-ounce containers but not one 6-ounce container?	<p>If I understand the TSA's <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/311">3-1-1 policy</a> in the US correctly, you are allowed to take two 3-ounce containers of a liquid on a plane, but not a single 6-ounce container of the same liquid. Is this really how the policy works? If so, what was the rationale for regulating carry-ons like this?</p> 
39791	What's the limit of liquids allowed in your purse while flying with United Airlines?	<p>I'm going to visit my boyfriend and as any girl, I want to smell nice for him. I'm flying with United, and I have an 89 ml body spray, 29 ml and 60 ml hand sanitizer. Is that allowed? </p> 
26303	Any way to find out what US Customs & Border Protection has in their database on me?	<p>I travel from the US to Canada occasionally (about once per year on average) with my family. We are all US citizens and travel with US passports. Every time we re-enter the United States, I am given extra scrutiny.</p>  <p>Most recently, we used an automated check-in procedure at the airport. These are terminals where you scan your passport &amp; fill out a customs declaration online and it prints a receipt which you take to the customs agent. When I got my receipt, it had a big "X" printed on it and we were directed to a line to talk to an agent.</p>  <p>In the past, I've had questions directed at me or my family: "Have you ever been to New York?", "Do you own any firearms?", and once "Where is your daddy?" directed at my then 4 year old son. The agents also seem to examine my photo &amp; my face more closely than the other members of my family.</p>  <p>We get through customs OK, but it gives me a some anxiety. I suspect that there's someone out there with the same name (I have a pretty common name) who is on a "no fly" list or something.</p>  <p>My question is this: is there any way to find out what they're looking for when they scan my passport &amp; see my name? Like a Freedom of Information request or something? I know I could/should ask when I'm in the line, but as I said, it makes me pretty anxious.</p> 
38718	From Italy to Austria during winter, by car	<p>In the first week of January, my family are going to travel from Milan (Italy) to Innsbruck (Austria), then to Munich (Germany) and finally back to Milan (maybe via Switzerland). All the hotels are already booked. My original plan was to rent a car to travel between these cities, but just now I found out that: in order to drive in Austria during the winter, the car should use winter tires. Italy rental car companies, doesn't offer this option, so, I can't rent a car that has winter tires and consequently I can't travel to Austria by car.</p>  <p>I know I have the option to travel by train, but sincerely, my first option is by car. So, does anyone know how can I handle this situation?</p>  <p>Also, I'm aware that, in order to drive in Switzerland, the car must have the "vignette". Does have any option to drive via Switzerland with a rental car and not to pay the full price for the "vignette"?</p>

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p>

10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
39435	Staying in Europe (Schengen and non-Schengen) for one year	<p>I am an Indonesian passport holder. I have a multiple entry Schengen visa, duration of stay: 90 days, valid for 2 years, issued by the Dutch embassy on November 2014 (valid until November 2016). I will be staying in the Netherlands for 90 days starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 March 2015. </p>  <p>My question is: can I spend 90 days in Romania/Croatia/Serbia/Bulgaria for 90 days starting from 1 April 2015 until 30 June 2015 using my existing Schengen visa? I will then fly back to the Netherlands on 1 July 2015 until 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>My aim is to stay in Europe for one whole year in 2015:</p>  <ol> <li>90 days in the Netherlands (January, February and March)</li> <li>90 days in either Romania or Croatia (April, May and June)</li> <li>90 days in the Netherlands again (July, August and September)</li> <li>90 days in either Serbia or Bulgaria (October, November and December)</li> </ol>

5538	Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?	<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>  <p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p> 
3640	Is it recommended to get vaccinations before visiting India?	<p>I'll be travelling to India soon.  I'm not sure if I'll have to time to get vaccinated since it usually takes 2 weeks to kick in.

38908	When booking elsewhere, how do you know what Virgin Australia ticket type you will get?	<p>When booking on the Virgin Australia website, it shows there being 4 different kinds of booking classes, along with details of what is and isn't included in them (eg flexibility and bags)</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/fHYJy.png" alt="Virgin Australia booking"></p>  <p>However, it only seems to offer bookings in Australian Dollars. If I go to another travel booking website which does sell me tickets in other currencies, then they all seem to describe the flights completely differently! For this case, I see a class of <code>Economy - T</code>. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BfHP9.png" alt="Other booking"></p>  <p>I would guess that since it says it includes one piece of checked luggage, it would be Saver not Saver Lite, but I'm not sure?</p>  <p>How can I map the booking code letters like <code>T</code> that other websites show me, to the Virgin Australia friendly names like Saver, so I can be sure?</p>

39990	Flight cancelled but doesn't show up on status	<p>I booked a SpiceJet flight from Dubai to Ahmedabad on Dec 16 (SG-16) scheduled to depart at 7:25 PM. At noon I received an SMS from SpiceJet to advise me that my flight has been delayed by 4h 50m. Sure enough, when I checked flight status on SpiceJet's website, that was the case. But on other websites like flightstats.com and dubaiairports.ae, the status was that flight was "delayed by 2h 25m".  </p>  <p>At 5 PM, I got an SMS that flight had been cancelled. I double checked on Spicejet's website and that too showed the flight to be cancelled. But both flightstats.com and dubaiairports.ae still showed the flight as delayed by 2h 25m.  </p>  <p>I went to the airport and met SpiceJet officials. Sure enough, the flight was cancelled. But somehow, the flight cancellation status never made it to the system. I have a Tripit Pro account, and even that never sent me an alert for that. I contacted the travel agent through which I booked my flight (makemytrip) for a refund, and they said that their system doesn't show that flight was cancelled. Now, even the Spicejet website has removed the cancellation status from that flight.  </p>  <p>Apart from the SMS, I now have no proof that my flight was cancelled.  </p>  <p>Can someone tell me, how can I proceed with a refund claim?</p> 
40026	Safest way to transport a laptop during flight	<p>I flew a long range flight carrying my laptop, a quite heavy one, inside a neoprene briefcase in the passenger cabin. The recommendation by the aircrew was to place it in the overhead compartment or under the seat in front of me. However, during take-off and landing, the vibrations on the plane are quite strong and, as a result, it received minor damage. </p>  <p>Placing them in the overhead compartment might be equivalent to placing it on the floor under the seat, with the added issue of additional luggage in the compartment shifting.</p>  <p>I considered the alternative of holding the laptop by the handle while sitting, so it won't be any contact with the aircraft's floor. This is impracticable during cruise, but I thought it could be better during the take-off and landing segments.<br> Another option I considered is to wrap it with completely with bubble wrap before boarding the plane. </p>  <p>Which is the safest way to transport a laptop during flight?</p>

39435	Staying in Europe (Schengen and non-Schengen) for one year	<p>I am an Indonesian passport holder. I have a multiple entry Schengen visa, duration of stay: 90 days, valid for 2 years, issued by the Dutch embassy on November 2014 (valid until November 2016). I will be staying in the Netherlands for 90 days starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 March 2015. </p>  <p>My question is: can I spend 90 days in Romania/Croatia/Serbia/Bulgaria for 90 days starting from 1 April 2015 until 30 June 2015 using my existing Schengen visa? I will then fly back to the Netherlands on 1 July 2015 until 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>My aim is to stay in Europe for one whole year in 2015:</p>  <ol> <li>90 days in the Netherlands (January, February and March)</li> <li>90 days in either Romania or Croatia (April, May and June)</li> <li>90 days in the Netherlands again (July, August and September)</li> <li>90 days in either Serbia or Bulgaria (October, November and December)</li> </ol> 
14888	Am I entitled to air passengers compensation if my flight was cancelled and I did not get a re-route?	<p>Recently a flight was cancelled and I think I was mistreated. On the day, about 5 of the flights from the airport got cancelled, they claimed it was because of bad weather. I had to wait for two more hours after my estimated departure time only to get information that my flight was cancelled.</p>  <p>However, 5 minutes from the information being anounced, another airlines plane departed from the same airport, and other departures were also succesful.</p>  <p>I did not get any re-routing options and was told I can re-book or refund at their website. They did not have any available flights until after more than a week and therefore I am not able to get home for Easter. I cried all day as I am spending Easter alone now.</p>  <p>Am I eligible for compensation? Shall I challenge the airline that the weather conditions were not to be considered as extreme circumstances?</p> 
14374	Are Digital Single Lens Reflex Cameras Permitted in the Empire State Building?	<p>I'm currently planning a trip to New York and have been looking at the website for the empire state building and noticed the following</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The items listed are not permitted in the Empire State Building.

2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
9542	When I purchase flights with an online travel agent, is there an "e-ticket" I must print out?	<p>I've always bought my tickets through travel agents in the past but this time I've bought two flights on two different websites.</p>  <p>Now in the emails they've sent me there is my itinerary but also quite a bit of "junk" like hotel offers.</p>  <p>I'm pretty sure I should take some printout to the airport, the ones I got from real travel agents were very clean, looking like typed sheets of info. Also in those cases I thought there were two kinds of printouts with one being the itinerary and the other being the more important one you need to have at the airport - but I can't remember exactly any more.</p>  <p>Another important factor is that both tickets are one-way flights. I want to be prepared to use a printout of the home leg as proof that I'm leaving in the case that immigration might ask me to produce it at the intermediate leg. (I'm spending six weeks in Korea on my way home to Australia from Turkey.)</p>  <p>I'm really confused as to whether the pages I printed out are the best ones, or if I missed something important with all the distracting ads. The two websites I used are:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://www.expedia.com.au"><code>Expedia.com.au</code></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.ebookers.com/">ebookers UK</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>Or could it be I'm worrying about nothing and all I need when I get to the airport is my name and the airlines will find me in their database? Even with one-way flights?</p> 
36572	What does it mean to be in the fast lane in California?	<p>I don't think I've ever understood this. </p>  <p>I travel frequently across the State of California by car.  And I often take the highway to get to many places.</p>  <p>One thing I don't understand is how fast lanes and slow lanes work.  I was recently travelling on a fast lane near San Francisco driving at the speed limit, when I noticed a cop who was travelling behind me honk at me, presumably because I was going slowly? I noticed there was a long line of cars behind me.  </p>  <p>So I moved into the slow lane.  But even weirder is that cars in the slow lane drive at the speed limit, and cars that drive in the fast lane drive way past the speed limit, even cops.  And I have never seen anybody get arrested for going faster than the speed limit, except for really fast drivers.</p>  <p>So I don't understand, even with 6 years of driving throughout California under my belt.  I understand the fast lane is for fast cars, but doesn't driving at the speed limit constitute fast? I really don't understand.  I talked to a local officer and they said that if there are cars tailgating you or lining up behind you, you should change lanes to a slower one, but if I'm already driving at the speed limit, how can I go any faster?</p> 
21198	Can I apply for a Schengen visa of the first port of entry or does it need to be the country of the longest duration?	<p>I'm planning to travel to the Netherlands, Spain and Bulgaria. My longest stay will probably be in Bulgaria. Now, Bulgaria doesn't issue a Schengen visa but allows people with a Schengen visa to visit. Which visa should I be applying for? Bulgarian Visa AND Schengen visa or just the Schengen visa for Netherlands or Spain?</p> 
40130	2 days overdue schengen visa	<p>I have counted the days wrong... I have a flight the 26 from Frankfurt to Chile, when I should be leaving the Schengen area the 24th... Is it a big deal to be 2 days over due? I am currently in London and will be reentering Schengen area in Amsterdam the 23rd and that would be my 89th day to then travel to Frankfurt and spend Christmas with my boyfriend's family. Is it possible to inform the immigration police/border control in Frankfurt when I reenter on the 23rd, so I can have a less harsh penalty? Or should I just see what happens the 26th?</p> 
40113	Do any States in the US give traffic tickets for 5 mph above the speed limit?	<p>In Louisiana, USA it's widely understood (unofficially) that one can travel 5mph above the speed limit without receiving a speeding ticket. </p>  <p>Does this rule apply when traveling the rest of the States? </p> 
13342	How to vomit during a flight?	<p>Last time I travelled I wasn't feeling quite well just before boarding the plane. I either had eaten something wrong or a flu just appeared. The thought of having to vomit during the flight made me panic a bit. The pocket in front usually contain these paper bags that act as a "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3104/vomitorium-only-common-in-the-german-speaking-world">vomitorium</a>", but I can hardly imagine them being useful especially with the cramped space you have these days. I tried to induce some preemptive vomiting before boarding without success but luckily a good powernap before boarding did the trick to have a nice trip.</p>  <p>So what is the best approach to deal with a bad stomach during a flight or just before boarding. If your really feel like vomiting, where or how to do that best?</p> 
19312	Where can I find delay/cancelation statistics for a given airline route?	<p>My flight got canceled yesterday and I am currently waiting for the delayed next flight. </p>  <p>Is there any website that keeps records of airlines being delayed/canceled? I would like to know my chances. I did find some sites through google (flightaware, flightstats), but they focus on us flights only and I am currently in the azores.</p>

29149	Is a passport needed for traveling by plane in Mexico? (Non-international flight)	<p>I am going to be driving into Tijuana to board a flight that will take me to Acapulco. My flight is from Tijuana to Acapulco. Both locations are in Mexico. Will I need to have a passport in order to attend the flight, even though the flight is from one place in Mexico to another? I heard that in this situation, a passport is not required, but a passport may be required upon reentering the US. Would other documents be sufficient for boarding this flight? I will be returning from Acapulco to Tijuana, and from there I will be driving back across the border to the U.S. </p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
35015	Does any airline in the world allow air travel without government identification?	<p>It seems that pretty much every airline requires at least one form of government identification for flights, even if it's a local flight within a single country.</p>  <p>Does any airline in the world form an exception to that rule? I was recently surprised to learn that <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5224/are-there-any-airlines-that-still-allow-smoking-on-board-flights">some airlines</a> still allow smoking on-board, so I'm sure there are also exceptions to the documents policy.</p>

21935	Is an EU residency permit for EU nationals a valid travel document within the EU?	<p>I am a citizen of an EU member state, being a resident in another EU member state. I hold a both a national identity card of my birth country and a resident permit of my home country. In an answer to an earlier question I asked about traveling to the UK with an almost invalid national identity card  it was <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/21933/141">mentioned</a> that at least in the UK I should be given "every reasonable opportunity” to prove I am an EEA national. Given that information is printed on my resident permit, I am wondering to what extend such a resident permit is a valid travel document to travel within the EU. </p> 
39908	No exit stamp on leaving Schengen area from Budapest to UK	<p>I'm a Georgian national holding a multiple entry Schengen visa.</p>  <p>Last summer I was traveling to Hungary, spent a few days there, then flew to the UK. The Hungarian border official did NOT stamp my passport on exiting the Schengen area. I had to enter it again a few days later and the German border guards were confused by what had happened. Finally they let me enter.</p>  <p>Now I have one more entry stamp into Schengen than exit stamp and run into problems EVERY time at a Schengen border.</p>  <p>Is there a way to fix this?</p> 
30547	As a French citizen, how long can I travel through Canada?	<p>I would like to visit Canada for a long time, as it is a large country and I have time.</p>  <p>I am a French citizen and I could not find a Canadian authoritative source that states the maximum duration of a French tourist stay on Canadian territory. The only source I found is the <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/conseils-par-pays/canada-quebec-compris/" rel="nofollow">French Ministry of Foreign Affairs{fr}</a> stating I could stay up to 6 months as a tourist without any specific visa.</p>  <p>While I hope the French Ministry does not provide wrong information, I could not find any information backing this up on <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp" rel="nofollow">Government of Canada website</a> (it still helped me determine I do not need a visa)</p> 
16806	Can I take a flight to Canada which stops in the USA, if I have restrictions from entering the USA?	<p>I am a Canadian citizen and I have been denied from the USA in the past 2 years and last year I entered illegally and was caught and given voluntary departure, but I do not have a criminal record in the USA or Canada. </p>  <p>NOW - I am currently in Costa Rica and looking to fly back to Canada, and it would be ideally priced with a stop in the USA. I am not banned from entering the USA for any amount of time but CBP has said I need to present 12 consecutive months worth of pay stubs and rent receipts proving my ties to Canada. Is there any way I can take a flight from Costa Rica with a stop in the USA? Is my onward flight ticket proof enough? Or will I be turned back before boarding in the airport in Costa Rica? Is there a number I can call to ask US customs about my legal situation?</p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey. He booked <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> and <em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>.<br> Somehow he needed to be earlier at location <em>B</em>, so he took a train and did not take the flight from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.</p>  <p>When he went to the airport to take the "back home" flight (<em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>), he was informed that his ticket was canceled because he did not take the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> flight. They canceled the ticket and sold it to someone else.</p>  <p>Is this normal? The company said it was their right to do so, and he could not get the flight back.<br> The company was Iberia.</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p> 
38873	Which are my options to find trip companions online?	<p>I like independent trips so I avoid tours packages. But sometimes I need to find a trip companion or to make a small group in order to reduce expenses (i.e. rent a car) or to reduce risks (i.e. big trekking without guide).</p>  <p>The problem is that I can't find a website that join independent travellers. I use Couchsurfing website and ask in forums, so I'd like to know if there is any online resource specific for this topic.</p>  <p>NOTE: I've try to search "trip companion" in Google, but all first page results seems to take me to dating sites except the first one that takes to Lonely Planet forum.</p>

35723	Is there a crowdfunding platform for trips?	<p>I often organise trips with a large group of friends. It is always a pain to get everybody to commit and pay in time to cover the deposits and/or book the tickets. It would be so convenient if it would be possible to let people commit similar to how people commit on a project on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" rel="nofollow">indiegogo</a> or <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" rel="nofollow">kickstarter</a>. </p>  <p>I was considering using indiegogo to setup a campaing, e.g. Lets go to Paris, and start making reservations once a minimal number of friends paid and committed to the trip. However, Indiegogo aims at reaching as many people as possible, whereas I would like to limit the crowd to very limited inner circle of friends. </p>  <p>Does a crowdfunding platform exist to cover very small travel projects to cover the initial costs? I could of course use the conventional method by letting people commit by transfer the initial funds by wire transfer. However, the beauty of projects like indiegogo, is that people commit and only if a target is reached their credit card is charged. If the target isn't reached, I don't have to deal with all the refunds. </p> 
26089	Travelling to the US with codeine-based medicines	<p>I'm travelling to the US next month, and I'd like to take my codeine-based painkillers with me. In the UK these are available without a prescription, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug#United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">over the counter</a> from a pharmacist. (It isn't just available in any old supermarket like some painkillers, but can just be sold in a pharmacy under supervision from the pharmacist, no Doctor involved)</p>  <p>I see from <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/67/kw/prescription%20medicine" rel="nofollow">this CBP advice</a> that <em>prescription</em> medication must have a prescription label attached, but presumably this applies to medicines that are only available on prescription in the US.  So my question is twofold:</p>  <ul> <li>Can I bring my codeine-based painkillers to the US without a prescription?</li> <li>More generally, is there a list of medicines that are commonly available in other parts of the world but restricted in the US?</li> </ul>

26915	Staying in the toilet during landing	<p>For safety purposes all airlines make you go back to your seat when you are in the toilet just before landing.</p>  <p>But, what if you really had to <em>go</em> and don't come out even after persistent knocking.

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

40085	Are there "turn up and board" shuttle buses from Cairns airport to the city, or do you always have to pre-book?	<p>Look at the <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Cairns#Get_in" rel="nofollow">WikiVoyage page for Cairns under "Get In"</a>, it mentions that there's a nearly-hourly airport shuttle running into the city centre. From other comments, I gather that the shuttle company mentioned in the wiki voyage article isn't the only one running.</p>  <p>However, the shuttle bus website linked from WikiVoyage is a rather broken site. There's no timetables there, no information, and the online reservation form doesn't work either... That's also apparently not the only one.</p>  <p>That leads me to wonder - is it possible to just arrive at the airport, find the bus stop(s), pay and get on the next bus? </p>  <p>Or do I need to pick one company, phone them up and try to book by phone onto one specific bus?</p>

20171	How to prevent the passenger in front of you from reclining without notice?	<p>I can totally understand <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11234/can-you-expect-the-flight-attendants-to-tell-the-passenger-in-front-of-you-to-pu">someone reclining his seat on a long-distance flight</a>. On a short hop, I don’t have any sympathy for anyone using his “right” to recline his seat. The seat pitch on short flights these days make you an anti-social person by default if you choose to recline. I had my share of not being able to even drink a cup of coffee because somebody just wanted to “rest”.</p>  <p>I usually try to reposition my legs as much as possible, not only because I have to, but also to try to make the journey as unpleasant for the rester as it is for me. I’m aware that is just childish behaviour, so I am wondering whether there are more effective and more civilized countermeasures to make the flight pleasant for both of us.</p> 
13494	Claustrophobic - travelling for the first time long RSA to USA	<p>I am trying my best to prepare for my upcoming flight to the USA, the trip is all under control, its just the flight that I'm terrified of.  I am very claustrophobic and do not even ride in elevators, I flew once locally for 1.5 hours. But my second flight will be 2 X 10 hours flights from South Africa to USA. </p>  <p>So please, I need to know, what it would be like, if I'll be OK on such a long flight, what can go wrong? And what do I need to be aware of.   </p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
9027	Layover at Narita, Japan. Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes. I am planning to stay within the airport during this period. Does anyone know if I will require a transit visa at Narita?</p> 
11594	Is there a ZIP code I can enter when paying-at-the-pump in the USA with a foreign credit card?	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kQL2im.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>In the USA, many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_at_the_pump">pay-at-the-pump</a> fuel dispensers that accept credit cards require a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code">5-digit numeric zip code</a> that corresponds to the billing address of the credit card.  In Canada, for instance, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada">6-digit alphanumeric postal codes</a>, so it's not obvious what you're supposed to type in since the gas dispensers have only numeric keypads.  Entering '00000' or '90210' seems to always result in failed authorization.</p>  <p>Is there a zip code that works for credit cards with foreign billing addresses?</p> 
40628	From what point could you view the most US states?	<p>A fairly simple question: from what single point could you see the most US states?  It seems like it should be a popular tourist attraction.</p> 
20849	Schengen tourist visa refused. Can I appeal for reconsideration?	<p>My Schengen tourist visa was rejected by the German Consulate, Chennai stating that my date of flying from Chennai to Berlin (02-Nov-13) is not the same as the starting date of leave approval from my office (06-Nov-13).</p>  <p>But my company has sanctioned me leave considering the fact that 02-Nov-13 to 5-Nov-13 are office holidays.<br> I wouldn't blame the consulate because they wouldn't know that and they consider mismatching dates to be a discrepancy.</p>  <p>Now, what could I do?<br> Shall I appeal for a reconsideration without paying the visa fee again? If yes, how do I do that? And also, what is the probability that they would reconsider again?</p>  <p>Or, shall I reapply fresh again with a correction in my leave letter from the office? I have sent a mail to the consulate but they haven't replied.</p>

Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p>

I noticed that every day, the same flight AB 1234 leaves at 11am.  It seems physically impossible for the same plane to travel 13 hours and return in about a similar amount of time to still make the next day flight.</p>  <p>Is it possible for two or more different planes to share the same flight number?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

26210	How are safety standards enforced in an airline which is not IOSA certified?	<p>I'm considering booking a flight with <a href="http://wowair.co.uk/">WOW Airlines</a> and since it's the first time I hear about it I did some research on google and I find mostly good reviews.  </p>  <p>However, while looking for the <a href="http://www.airlineratings.com/ratings/313/wow-air">safety ranking</a>, I found out that WOW Airlines is not IOSA certified. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>What is IOSA Certification? The IATA* Operational Safety Audit (IOSA)   certification audit is an internationally recognised and accepted   evaluation system designed to assess the operational management and   control systems of an airline. IOSA uses internationally recognised   audit principles and is designed to conduct audits in a standardised   and consistent manner. Airlines are re evaluated every two years.   Registering for IOSA certification and auditing is not mandatory   therefore an airline that does not have IOSA certification may have   either failed the IOSA audit or alternatively chosen not to   participate. *IATA (International Air Transport Association) - See   more at:   <a href="http://www.airlineratings.com/ratings/313/wow-air#sthash.oLSquDNX.dpuf">http://www.airlineratings.com/ratings/313/wow-air#sthash.oLSquDNX.dpuf</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>While I understand this is not mandatory, <strong>does this mean they have low safety standards or said standards are enforced in other ways</strong>?</p> 
33762	Is transit time of 40 mins enough for a transit at Dusseldorf airport?	<p>I am flying from U.S. to India via Germany(2 stops - Dusseldorf and Munich). There is a 40 min layover at Dusseldorf and 1 h 40 min layover at Munich. I am concerned if I will be able to make to the connection to Munich. Is 40 mins enough time for a transit? Also, I am not a US citizen and will require an airport transit visa, which I am planning to get before I travel. Are there extra clearances/security checks required for Dusseldorf-Munich transit for people on transit visas, which may cause delays?</p> 
22888	Is a flight number unique for the schedule, origin and destination?	<p>For example, if we have a flight with a code <code>SU0102</code>, does it always goes from Sheremetyevo to John F.

The same about schedule: does a flight <code>SU0102</code> always leave at 15:40 and arrives at 17:10 or the hours can change?</p>  <p>In short words, can the schedule, origin and destination change for a flight with a certain number and if so is it frequent?</p>

41765	Is it legal to have 2 flights in the air at the same time with the same flight #?	<p>My son was flying from a Rochester NY to Washington Dulles on flight 4578. They were to land, pickup passengers, then continue to Raleigh. The flight from Rochester was delayed so late arriving in DC. While in the air, the same flight number left DC to Raleigh - obviously different plane. How does that happen? </p> 
7601	What's the difference between a direct and a non-stop flight?	<p>In a comment to one of my question, a user mentioned that there is a difference between a direct and a non-stop flight. So what is this difference?</p> 
9921	Are there any flight price search engines with baggage allowance included?	<p>I am looking for a flight search engine that includes a luggage calculator in the price. I recently booked a trip and had the choice between two carriers at the time, and not feeling very stupid I chose the cheaper one.</p>  <p>The crux is that after I had paid I found out that the more expensive airline had vastly different rules for baggage. In fact it allowed twice the amount of baggage without extra charge.</p>  <p>After having found the price for extra luggage very extreme I had already decided I will send the extra baggage as separate freight, because the speed is not important. But of course had I known this from the start I could have saved myself a lot of work and money.</p>  <p>I am aware that this information can be found on respective carrier website, but even within a single company it can differ from route to route. Would be handy if I didn't have to try and calculate it all myself.</p>  <p>So my question is simply, is there any flight search engine/price comparison site where I can also enter my total baggage needs to have it included in the price comparison between carriers?</p> 
41770	Is China Airlines safe?	<p>I live in Sydney and I have bought a flight from Sydney to Christchurch - New Zealand next month. The company is China Airlines (CI) and I got concerned when I saw some lists considering it the least safe airline company, but I also have heard they improved in this aspect.</p>  <p>The aircraft is the A330-300. I checked the possibility of changing to Qantas and it would cost me 1500 dollars (almost one month of work)</p>  <p>Do you think I should change or CI is considered safe today?</p> 
1642	China Airlines, safe?	<p>I've got a long-haul flight booked with China Airlines (A330 and an A340) from LHR to SYD, and only after I booked it did I decide to read up on their safety record. Suffice to say I regret doing that; for example see their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines#Incidents_and_accidents" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any experience with China Airlines? Am I being a wuss?</p>  <p>I'm considering cancelling my flight (it's a long way off yet anyway) and rebooking with someone I've flown with before (Singapore or Virgin Atlantic probably).</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to clarify, I understand all airlines have issues; however, I'm slightly concerned that China Airlines seem to tend to have more "and there were no survivors" kind of issues.</p> 
37998	How safe are the ferries in Indonesia?	<p>I'm planning a holiday to Indonesia and want to visit multiple islands. I had thought to take ferries between the different islands. However, a lot of people have told me bad things about the ferries in Indonesia, including:</p>  <p>(a) The ferries have far too many people packed onto them, well above the limit imposed for health &amp; safety reasons</p>  <p>(b) The ferries are not seaworthy and therefore likely to be involved in a tragic accident</p>  <p>(c) The ferries will give you a rough crossing to the point of making you ill</p>  <p>Basically, I just want to know if the situation is really this bad. For example, are there safety records of Indonesian ferries to give an objective view of the situation?</p>  <p>To be more objective, some pointer questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Are these things really true, or just people complaining without good reason?</li> <li>What kind of things can go wrong if the ferry operators put more people on than the limit?</li> <li>How frequently do accidents really happen on ferry routes compared to how many ferry crossings there are in a year? For example, is it significantly more likely to be killed in an Indonesian shipping accident than in a plane accident?</li> <li>What are the other ways of travelling between Indonesian islands and the benefits/disadvantages of each? Flying is an obvious one, but is this really practical (in order to reach typical tourist destinations quickly enough to fit into, say, a 10-day long holiday) and does it have any similar safety risks associated with local carriers?</li> </ol> 
14054	Do I need a Turkey transit visa for a layover?	<p>I have an Indian passport and am planning to visit Germany with a valid visa.

I was hoping that someone might know what kind of requirements there are for the different visas.  </p>  <p>We are from the United States.

23854	Hiking rucksack with a rollmat hanging out - will it survive as checked in luggage?	<p>I'm expecting to do some travelling soon - this will involve both backpacking (possibly sleeping on a floor or two, maybe some camping) and air travel.</p>  <p>I'm thinking of bringing a rollmat. It's too big, so I normally let it hang strapped to the bottom of my hiking rucksack. Is this likely to cause any issue as checked in luggage, provided it's tightly strapped?

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p>

39100	How do I cross US-Canada border while my (US) passport is being renewed?	<p>I'm getting ready to renew my US passport for the first time.  Since I got this passport the ID requirements at the US-Canada border have gotten stricter, so I've been using my passport when driving across that border.</p>  <p>I have no current international travel plans within the renewal window, but I have relatives in Canada and one never knows when a family emergency might occur, especially with older relatives.  Renewing the passport requires temporarily surrendering the current (still-valid) one.  A little Googling tells me that I wouldn't be able to cross this border (in both directions) with an <em>expired</em> passport at all, so waiting doesn't help.</p>  <p>How do I retain my ability to drive to Canada and back home while my passport renewal is being processed?  I don't have an "enhanced" driver's license (whatever that is).  I do have a copy of my birth certificate.  My only citizenship is US.</p>

Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
39435	Staying in Europe (Schengen and non-Schengen) for one year	<p>I am an Indonesian passport holder. I have a multiple entry Schengen visa, duration of stay: 90 days, valid for 2 years, issued by the Dutch embassy on November 2014 (valid until November 2016). I will be staying in the Netherlands for 90 days starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 March 2015. </p>  <p>My question is: can I spend 90 days in Romania/Croatia/Serbia/Bulgaria for 90 days starting from 1 April 2015 until 30 June 2015 using my existing Schengen visa? I will then fly back to the Netherlands on 1 July 2015 until 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>My aim is to stay in Europe for one whole year in 2015:</p>  <ol> <li>90 days in the Netherlands (January, February and March)</li> <li>90 days in either Romania or Croatia (April, May and June)</li> <li>90 days in the Netherlands again (July, August and September)</li> <li>90 days in either Serbia or Bulgaria (October, November and December)</li> </ol> 
2970	What is the connecting time to consider for International to International Transfers in US Airports?	<p>There is a question on "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa">the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA</a>". In one <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/956/what-is-the-minimum-time-to-consider-with-a-connecting-flight-in-the-usa/1214#1214">answer</a> it is said that "international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible". The author explains afterwards why. </p>  <p>I would like to ask a related question. What is the minimum time you have to allow for an international to international connection in US airports? For instance, flying from Europe into Latin America can imply transiting through an US airport. What are your experiences with these kind of connections?</p> 
25032	Transfer time at Newark	<p>Is 95 minutes enough transfer time at Newark (<a href="/questions/tagged/ewr" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ewr&#39;" rel="tag">ewr</a>) incoming at terminal B from Cancun, outgoing from terminal B for Oslo?</p>  <p>Flying United all the way.</p> 
30451	Is 2h 45m enough for a layover in EWR transferring from an int'l to a domestic flight (Terminal B → Terminal C)?	<p>I am arriving from Frankfurt(FRA) to Newark(EWR) and I must pass the Customs and Border Control before catching the next flight to Baltimore (BWI). Both flight are on the same ticket by United Airlines (UA51 and UA4775)</p>  <ol> <li>Is 2 hours and 45 minutes enough time to catch the next plane, or do I have to expect longer waiting times and should go for a different route?</li> <li>I'll be traveling before the AirTrain starts operating. What is the best way to get from Terminal B to C? </li> <li>I have heard that there is a transfer shuttle bus that connects the terminals such that you don't need to leave security area. What is the schedule for this bus?</li> <li>I'm not sure about the procedure for arriving from abroad. As far as I understood, I'll need to: <ul> <li>Collect my check-in luggage </li> <li>Pass border control and customs (Immigration)</li> <li>Transfer from Terminal B to C</li> <li>Check my luggage into Domestic Flight</li> <li>Go through Security Check</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Is there a way to optimize this procedure to save time? Can I re-check my luggage in terminal B?</p>  <p>What are my options if I miss the connection? Just go to the UA counter and ask to reserve the next possible flight?</p> 
31113	Best way to sleep at Vancouver International Airport and wake up on time?	<p>I have a layover in YVR (Vancouver international airport) from roughly 8:10 pm to 7:30 am. I don't want to spend money on a hotel or a "sleep-pod"/equivalent. I will most likely bring a sleeping bag and pillow. Other things to note:</p>  <p>I am a very light sleeper and will be wearing heavy-duty ear plugs.</p>  <p>It is <em>crucial</em> I get at least 8 hours of sleep and will therefore take soporific(s).</p>  <p>I obviously can't miss my flight.</p>  <p>What is the best way to sleep in an airport, while spending little to no money? </p>  <p>Ideas I have thought of:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Set a high-volume alarm on my phone, 30 minutes or so before boarding.</p></li> <li><p>Ask a flight attendant or other airport employee to wake me - possibly in combination with (1)</p></li> <li><p>Ask another "layover-ee" to wake me</p></li> <li><p>Tape a sign above me with an arrow pointing downward that says "Please wake at 7:00 am! Will pay $5!"</p></li> </ol>  <p>Ideas, please?</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>I am <em>not</em> worried about theft of my possessions. I will simply put all my, very small, valuables (phone, wallet, passport) at the bottom of my sleeping bag. This is assuming that I will wake up, should some idiot attempt to pull me out of my sleeping bag to steal my valuables..I also do not have a carry-on. </p>  <p>The main thing I am concerned with is missing my flight.</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
17385	Is a Schengen visa/transit visa required for transit flight from Vienna to Frankfurt?	<p>I am travelling form Delhi (DEL) to San Francisco (SFO), I have to make a connection flight in Vienna that would take me to Frankfurt (FRA). My flight to SFO is from FRA, I have one ticket for entire journey and the flights are operated by Lufthansa or its subsidiaries.</p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? My flight arrives at Vienna international airport and leaves from the same, and for second leg it arrives at Frankfurt international airport.</p>  <p>I asked this question as an addendum to my <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17382/is-layover-time-of-1hr-and-5-min-enough-at-vienna-international-airport-to-catch">previous post</a> but was advised to make a new post.</p>  <p>I hold Indian passport and valid US visa.</p> 
4872	What to do if drugs / a bomb are planted in your travel bag?	<p>So the scene: You're flying from Bogota, Colombia to New York, USA.  You arrive, pick up your bag from the carousel, and figure you'll stuff your netbook you used on the flight into your bag now rather than lugging it through the airport under one arm.</p>  <p>However, when you open your bag, you see something that you certainly did not pack. Drugs/a bomb/live snake, take your pick.</p>  <p>Now you didn't pack these, but you're pretty sure the guys ahead who will x-ray / sniffer dog your bag won't take kindly to seeing them there.  What are you supposed to do in this situation??</p>  <p>(Note, while this has not happened to me, it's certainly claimed to have happened to several people travelling from Bali, Thailand and other places - see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schapelle_Corby">Schapelle Corby</a> case for an example)</p> 
3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage.

21650	Must I enter Europe with Schengen visa from the country where I applied?	<p>If I applied for a Schengen visa from "country A" and I got the visa but I had some commitments in "country B" and I have to finish it before going to Europe should I get back to "country A" to travel to Europe or can I use the visa from any where? </p> 
25705	Which embassy will most likely provide a multiple entry Schengen visa?	<p>I have already travelled to schengen area once on a single entry Schengen visa.

22851	Refund rules for a confirmed ticket vs non-confirmed ticket booked through Tatkal scheme of Indian railways	<p>I have a few questions before I try to book a ticket through Tatkal scheme of Indian Railways:</p>  <ol> <li>I would like to know if I book a tatkaal ticket on irctc website for indian railways and I <strong>do not get a confirm ticket</strong>, can I get refund of the money?</li> <li>Also if I happen to cancel a <strong>confirmed tatkaal ticket</strong>, is there any refund scheme?</li> </ol>  <p>Edit: I did check the <a href="http://www.indianrail.gov.in/refund_Rules.html" rel="nofollow">refund rules in the Indian railways website</a> and I found out the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>No refund of fare shall be admissible on confirmed Tatkal ticket.    In case of Tatkal ticket on <strong>waitlist</strong>, refund of fare shall be granted in   accordance with rule for unused waitlisted or RAC tickets.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I guess the answer to my first question above is <em>yes</em> and the answer to the second question is <em>no</em> unless rules have changed recently and they are not yet documented.</p>  <p>But the second line of the quote above only mentions about waitlisted tatkaal tickets.</p>  <ol> <li>Is there no concept of RAC tickets through Tatkal scheme?</li> <li>What does the rule for unused waitlisted or RAC tickets say? I would specifically like to know the rules for e-tickets as I am planning to do online booking only.</li> </ol>

Is it wiser to stay inside ICN or should I spend sometime exploring the area on foot/train/bus? This is assuming that I will have a secure place to put luggage. I <em>can</em> also exchange money for Korean Won.</p>

16806	Can I take a flight to Canada which stops in the USA, if I have restrictions from entering the USA?	<p>I am a Canadian citizen and I have been denied from the USA in the past 2 years and last year I entered illegally and was caught and given voluntary departure, but I do not have a criminal record in the USA or Canada. </p>  <p>NOW - I am currently in Costa Rica and looking to fly back to Canada, and it would be ideally priced with a stop in the USA. I am not banned from entering the USA for any amount of time but CBP has said I need to present 12 consecutive months worth of pay stubs and rent receipts proving my ties to Canada. Is there any way I can take a flight from Costa Rica with a stop in the USA? Is my onward flight ticket proof enough? Or will I be turned back before boarding in the airport in Costa Rica? Is there a number I can call to ask US customs about my legal situation?</p> 
8484	How to get to Ljubljana (Slovenia) from Trieste (Italy) by Train?	<p>My Italian part of my trip is almost over; currently enjoying Trieste.</p>  <p>I have been using the train around Italy but when I checked the Trenitalia website to see if a train left from Trieste to Ljubljana it says it does not know of any trains?</p>  <p>This does not make sense, surely there must be a train service from Italy to Slovenia?</p>  <p><a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ad1ce14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD">http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ad1ce14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD</a></p>  <p>If not does anyone know the best way to get from Trieste to Ljubljana?</p> 
41992	Train Journey into Croatia from Italy	<p>We will be spending some time in Italy during early July this year, and we will be finishing up in Verona.</p>  <p>The next part of our trip involves getting into Croatia from here which is proving to be slightly complicated whilst keeping to a travel preference of train over bus.</p>  <p>Originally I had planned to use a route I found using OBB's journey planner:<br> <code>Verona -&gt; Venice -(OBB ICBus)-&gt; Villach -(EC 213)-&gt; Zagreb</code> </p>  <p>I've just had another look now and put in my travel dates, but I don't see this route in the route planner anymore so I'm trying to find alternative methods just in case.</p>  <p>I know there is a bus that runs from Trieste, so it could be possible for us to take a train to Trieste and then a bus to Croatia. According to this website there is a couple of buses which run along this route <a href="http://www.buscroatia.com">http://www.buscroatia.com</a></p>  <p>Either way, both methods will take roughly the same amount of time (leaving at approximately 10am and arriving at 8:30pm)</p>  <p>So my questions:</p>  <ul> <li>Am I by any chance looking too early for my original route to show up on the journey planners, or have the timetables been changed?</li> <li>Heading into Austria seems a bit out of the way, is there an easier way? I'm aware that there are no direct trains between Italy and Slovenia.</li> <li>If we take a connecting train in Austria, what happens in regards to 'entering the country/crossing the border' on arrival to Austria? We will only be in there for a couple of hours maximum until the connecting train comes. I don't believe we need a visa. (We're Australian)</li> <li>Weighing up the options, the bus from Trieste is seeming to be the most stress-free choice. Would it be wise to ditch my original plan and look at this option?</li> </ul>  <p>I've read the question <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8484/how-to-get-to-ljubljana-slovenia-from-trieste-italy-by-train">How to get to Ljubljana (Slovenia) from Trieste (Italy) by Train?</a> and to me some of the answers to connect between Italy and Slovenia seem to be a bit more involved than what I've planned out above. </p>  <p>I hope this question isn't too broad for this site, this is the only part of the trip left which is still a bit cloudy.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen).

4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
25584	Book connecting flight, but only board at second airport?	<p>I'm looking to book flights from) Philadelphia (PHL) to Detroit (DTW). Direct flights are quite expensive. I noticed, in expanding a search to surrounding airports, that I can book from Allentown (ABE) to Detroit for <strong>far</strong> less, and the connection is through Philadelphia.</p>  <p>Can I book this flight but board in Philadelphia? I'll be traveling with carry-on luggage only, so on the return, it's obviously no problem. But would I be allowed through security and on to the plane in PHL with out having flown from Allentown? </p> 
12873	Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?	<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>  <p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>  <p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>  <p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>  <p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p>

22975	Can I opt to disembark on a stop over (if I am a national of that country) before the second leg of the journey?	<p>I am a seaman working on a cruise ship and my company arranges flights for our return home on completion of our contracts.  I am a New Zealand National and they have booked me a flight from Santiago to Sydney (Australia) which has a stop at Auckland (NZ).</p>  <p>I am then required to wait in Sydney before I can then catch the flight they have booked for me from there back to Wellington.  I have informed my company but they won't change my flight. What I wanted to know is if I could just disembark the plane at Auckland and arrange my own flight back to Wellington?

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first?

3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p> 
6543	Entry into US with unpaid medical bills and ticket for careless driving	<p>While on vacation in the US last year, my wife and I was in a traffic accident. My wife had to spend more than a week in hospital before we could fly home. Our insurance is covering everything, but we keep receiving more bills in the mail. We are forwarding the bills to our insurance company, who tells us that they are taking care of them, but they are probably not paying them immediately (I expect there are a lot of paperwork involved). We can see that some of the invoices have strange addresses on them and have taken a long time to reach us, so we are a bit worried that there might be others that haven't reached us yet.</p>  <p>Also, since the accident was partly my fault, I received a ticket for careless driving, which I have paid.</p>  <p>We are going back to the US in a few weeks on vacation. Can any of this give us problems in immigration or elsewhere? Is there anything we should do or special papers we should bring?</p> 
18295	Are inexpensive ryokans inauthentic?	<p>A lot of people I talk to, including Japanese and non-Japanese, claim that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_%28Japanese_inn%29">ryokans</a> are expensive.</p>  <p>Once, when I discussed this further and said that some places that I've been to describe themselves as ryokans and aren't expensive, the other person speculated that maybe it's not a real ryokan, and doesn't offer the same services a "real" ryokan does.</p>  <p>I found this very plausible, and I joked that maybe just offering a futon on a tatami mat would be enough to fool me into thinking that it's Japanese-style accommodation.</p>  <p>Examples of inexpensive (at least to me) ryokans include <a href="http://kumagairyokan.com/service.html">Kumagai Ryokan</a> in Morioka and <a href="http://www.kimiryokan.jp/">Kimi ryokan</a> in Ikebukuro.</p>  <p>I've heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_%28Japanese_inn%29#Minshuku">minshukus</a>, but none of the places I've gone to have called themselves that.</p>  <p>Are inexpensive ryokans inauthentic?</p> 
41937	As an American -- where can I NOT go?	<p>That's right folks.  Where on this beautiful blue and green (and some yellow and grey in there too) marble of ours would an American of European descent be disallowed access or would face serious risk for accessing?</p>

5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
24980	Language problems at the airport?	<p>I have a family member who speaks Romanian but not English, French or any other world language. If she flies alone, how can she pass through the control points (immigration, customs) at the airport?</p>  <p>Would it work if she brings a sheet with translations of the common questions and answers? Do airports (CDG in particular) have interpreters available for most languages? Is there any arrival card (for France) she will need to fill?</p> 
911	What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?	<p>I've travelled a lot.  Living in New Zealand or the UK means anywhere is likely a flight, but I've always flown economy.  Twice between LA and Auckland I managed to get the exit row after talking nicely to the check-in girl, but apart from that, nothing.  I've spoken to ticket agents, tried 'check in chicken' (where you wait until the last minute before checking in, hoping there's an overbooking of economy) but have never managed to get an upgrade, while others I know seemingly get them quite often.  What strategy have you used or do you suggest to achieve this?</p>  <p>My next flight is from Melbourne to Tokyo, and I plan on trying all of these ;)</p>  <p>(Related questions on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17183/101">car hire</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17026/101">hotel</a> upgrades)</p>

31083	What rights do you have in China to appeal stuff being taken off you in transit?	<p>I debated this, but I think it's askable.  I just flew transit through Beijing. Did NOT enter the country.  You still have to go through security though, but whatever, it just takes time.  Until I got called aside for questioning about my Anker Power Charger (<a href="http://www.lktown.com/products/product_detail/44.html" rel="nofollow">this model</a>).</p>  <p>The conversation:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Security:</strong> "What is this? It has no label"<br>   <strong>Me:</strong> "It's a USB charger, for charging my phone, for example"<br>   <strong>Security:</strong> "It has no labels showing how much power, it's not allowed into China"<br>   <strong>Me:</strong> "It's not going into China, I'm only in transit! Also, where, anywhere, is there a sign saying it must be labelled?" (It had been, but was worn off)<br>   <strong>Security:</strong> "We can keep it for you, one month"<br>   <strong>Me:</strong> "What use is that if after a month you still won't let me take it on a flight?"<br>   <strong>Security:</strong> "Sorry, It's not allowed into China"<br>   <strong>Me:</strong> "It was MADE in China!"</p> </blockquote>  <p>Anyway, despite my protests, it was removed from me, as well as similar items from other passengers (I got to see a lot of them while having this discussion).</p>  <p>Essentially, however, I had no leg to stand on. They could have claimed my laptop computer for all I knew, and I couldn't see any way to protest, get a claim, or anything like that. </p>  <p>So I guess my question is - is there a way to get documentation of the event, and claim for it later, or a way to officially protest, say from the airport OR the airline, given nobody warned me they'd be looking at and confiscating power banks with worn off labels?</p> 
16617	How to convince airport security that I am not dangerous when having metallic parts in my body?	<p>I had an operation some time ago and now I have small screws in my shoulder which will not be removed anymore. When I decided to fly for vacation, I supposed that these will may bring me into trouble at the airport when going through the metal detector.</p>  <p>So I asked my doctor and at the hospital if there is any kind of "passport" or something similar which confirms the screws in my shoulder so that I do not get into many problems. Unfortunately, they told me such things do only exist if you get a new knee or something, not if you just have a few screws in your body.</p>  <p>When I flew from Vienna to Amsterdam and back, my fears were confirmed: The security staff inspected me very precise, and I had to explain them my story. Thank god I have some scars left so they believed me!</p>  <p>However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any international "passport" which my doctor and hospital do not know about? If not, what else are my possibilities?</p>  <p>I am not that afraid when travelling within the EU, however I fear that this situation might get quite dangerous when I'm in other countries...</p> 
35643	Is it against regulations to pack my laptop battery on its own in my checked luggage?	<p>We have several small children, which complicates traveling and requires us to compact our hand luggage as much as possible. We've been tempted to check in our laptop in our luggage, but have been (understandably) afraid to do so. Instead we've hit on a compromise lately – we take our actual laptop in our carry-on luggage, but we strip off everything possible and pack it in our checked-in luggage – battery, charger, mouse, etc. The idea is that these things are easily replaceable (if an expense), and on the slight chance that the luggage gets lost, we can repurchase them without losing any data/work/etc.</p>  <p>We've done this on several flights lately without incident. However, we just traveled from Tel Aviv, Israel to Zurich, Switzerland and back again. On the return trip, our laptop battery was confiscated at the Zurich airport (and we are expected to go there to retrieve it, which is not very probable). I've researched the regulations since then, and it seems that some airlines/airports do not allow you to pack "spare" lithium batteries in your checked in luggage. This leaves us wondering what exactly the definition of "spare" is, as this was not really a spare battery; we just separated it from the laptop temporarily for traveling.</p>  <p>What are the regulations regarding checking in laptop batteries? Less important (I'm just curious): why are you allowed to have "spare" laptop batteries in your hand luggage but not checked in? (Most luggage regulations are the opposite – checked in luggage is more lenient than carry on.)</p> 
42411	Are battery packs allowed in hand luggage?	<p>When flying, are you allowed to bring battery packs / power banks? I'd like to bring my ACC 10400mAh Power Bank on several flights.</p> 
7807	Single vs. Multiple entry Schengen visa, for Spain and France?	<p>I am from Egypt and I'm planning a vacation to <strong>Spain and France</strong>. While filling the visa application, should I choose a single or a multiple entry visa?! If i got a single entry Schengen visa, I still can travel from Spain to France and then back to Spain as long as it is during the valid dates of my visa right?!</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
35311	One hour Lufthansa transit time in Frankfurt. Origin: Bangalore, destination: Dublin	<p>I have bought a ticket from Bangalore (India) to Dublin (Ireland) through Frankfurt (Germany), both of the flights are of Lufthansa and as a part of the same ticket. The transit time I will have is 1 hour in Frankfurt. Last time there was a 1 hour 20 minutes of time available between changing aircraft, but the connecting flight was late and I was able to board comfortably. Therefore I am not able to estimate this time how long it may take. I was wondering if this is too little time. Also I would like to know what the possibilities are in the case of missing the connecting flight.</p> 
37045	Item held by customs until I pay tax; what are my options?	<p>I just arrived in the UK yesterday, from the US, carrying a piece of jewelry, which I intend to carry with me for the following months before I give it to someone at the right time and place, then presenting it to a special someone.</p>  <p>Immigration discovered the jewelry while searching my bags for unrelated reasons<sup>*</sup>, and informed me that I should discuss the jewelry with customs later to see if a duty needed to be paid, which I did.</p>  <p>The relevant bit is, because the intended recipient is an EU citizen (with dual Spanish/Guatemalan citizenships), currently living in the UK, even though I will not be giving the gift to her in the UK (or in the EU--I intend to gift the item in January in Guatemala, after she has moved back home to her family), the customs agent determined that I must pay a tax of £510 before I can retrieve my item.</p>  <p>As I did not have that much money available when I arrived, I said I would return Friday to pay the tax and collect the item.</p>  <p>Aside from trying again, most likely in vain, to explain that I will retain the item for the duration of my stay, do I have any possible recourse?  Can I ship the item out of the EU rather than collecting it in the airport?  Or could I board a flight leaving the EU with the item, rather than paying the tax?  Or anything else?</p>  <hr>  <p><sup>*</sup>While I believe the details of the search are irrelevant to this question, it's been asked about many times, and it's reasonable that it <em>might</em> be relevant under some circumstances, so I will elaborate:</p>  <ul> <li>I arrived without a booked ticket for onward travel, which raised suspicion</li> <li>I had only carry-on baggage, which further raised suspicion</li> <li>I arrived with minimal cash, and primarily debit/credit cards</li> <li>After some questions about my work, financial means, etc (all routine), the immigration agent searched my bags</li> <li>When he came across the ring, I explained its purpose, and he called over a coworker, and they agreed that I should discuss it with customs, even though I wasn't planning to leave it in the UK</li> <li>After the immigration agent was done with me, he simply showed me to the customs area, and left me. He made no effort to follow me, or hand me over directly to customs, so he didn't appear to have any worries that I would try to evade customs.</li> </ul>  <p>I have entered the UK multiple times under identical circumstances (most recently less than a month prior), and have never gone through a search, so I didn't think anything of it.  The particular agent, however, was training a new recruit, may have made him examine everyone more closely for training purposes, but for whatever reason, as luck would have it, he chose to search my bags, although that has never happened before to me.</p> 
10226	Travelling within the US as a foreign citizen without a passport	<p>I'm travelling within the US and am a British citizen. Can I travel without my passport and just show my UK driver's license instead?</p> 
14015	Are airport duty-free shops really cheaper?	<p>I guess this one will be hard to answer because prices vary from airport to airpot, but...every time I travel friends tell me not to forget to "bring something from the free shop".</p>  <p>On a general basis it would be advisable to wait for the free shop to buy things you are willing to buy? </p>  <p>Is the price difference really worth the risk of not finding what you are looking for at the airport? or is it just a marketing stunt to get more sales?</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p>

22038	I'm a foreigner, can I fly inside USA with my USA visa if my passport expires?	<p>My passport expires this coming January 2014, I'm planning to travel in February (domestic flight).</p>  <p>I have read that you can travel inside the USA with any government issue ID, Last time I traveled I show my visa on step of my passport, and the airline woman went to the first page of my passport on step of looking at my visa information that contains my picture and information, so I didn't try it with the TSA agent.</p>  <p>I still have my foreign ID from my original country that expires 2018, can I use this with no problem? I rather use my visa since is an American issue document, is in English and easy to understand on step of my Spanish national ID.</p>  <p>I don't have time to renew my passport because it takes from 1-3 months.</p> 
17811	Can I fly domestically in the US using my university ID?	<p>Okay, so I'm an international Student here in the US. and My passport is being renewed right now. And I have to fly to Seattle in a week. So I was wondering if my university ID will suffice for a Photo ID at the airport?</p>  <p>EDIT: Or is an expired passport, but with a Valid US visa, acceptable?</p> 
42314	Why do airlines now charge for flying standby in the US?	<p>Previously if you wanted to fly standby or arrived early for a connection you could put yourself on the Standby list for free.  If there was room you could board in a win-win, i.e. the plane was flying with that seat empty anyway, and now has opened up a seat in a later flight.  Although it was possible to try to game the system by buying a cheaper later flight and then trying to fly standby on an earlier one that always seemed too Russian roulette.  I’m hoping somebody in the industry knows the real answers as opposed to some speculation points I’ve listed below (just in case people answer with these items we’ve already thought about)</p>  <p><strong>Free Standby:</strong> Customer Good Will, Seat was empty anyway, newly opened capacity that could be filled, negative costs to later flight now affect less passengers</p>  <p><strong>Paid Standby:</strong> Is the revenue increase greater than bad will generated (admittedly intrinsic) as well as negative costs incurred for later flight problems?</p> 
3054	Can you really get around everywhere with only speaking English?	<p>I had a discussion with a friend on how many language one should learn to be able to be understood worldwide? My estimate would be with around 4-5 languages, but this is a gut feeling which I cannot verify.  My friend was really firm in his statement, that you only need to speak English. It is the global language. According to him, there will be always someone around being sufficient in English. Is he correct, or are there regions where you need to speak another language then English, to travel around. </p> 
30513	How to take money to Iran?	<p>A friend in Australia is on a trip to Iran soon, and has the problem that she can't get local currency in advance.  Is there any way to do this before hitting the country, or is it perfectly acceptable to take Euros and/or USD?  This is implied on at least <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/practical-information/money-costs">one website</a> however there's no indication that you can withdraw more while in the country, as on the same link it indicates that ATMs there only work with local cards, so it's unclear how you're meant to get more money once you're there.</p> 
5457	How to avoid letting a rental business hold my passport in Thailand?	<p>I'm considering renting a motorcycle in Thailand, and the terms on the rental company's website state they will hold my passport for the duration of the rental. While I do not intend to leave the country, I don't like the idea of leaving my passport behind. Authorities may want to see my passport, such as a hotel clerk or a traffic policeman.</p>  <p>Is it legal for a business in Thailand to hold my passport for any reason?</p>  <p>What are my options if I don't want to give them my passport? <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/589/motorbikes-in-thailand-and-laos">This question</a> suggests trying to convince the business to accept a photocopy of my passport.

42447	Economical mobile data for US and Canada	<p>I am travelling to US and Canada from Australia this year and was wondering what would be the most economical and hassle free option for having mobile data and call time on my iPhone that gives me good coverage on both east and west coasts for both countries. </p>  <p>Option 1: Buy individual SIMs for each each country and switch upon arrival in that country. Option 2: Buy one SIM that works in both countries. Will there be any roaming changes etc ? Option 3: Anything else you may suggest.</p>  <p>Also, if you could suggest any good providers I'll throw in a free Sham-wow along with an up-vote and potentially an accepted answer. Many Thanks.</p> 
20061	In which countries are the visitor's first name and last name compulsory?	<p>My name consists of just a first name and no surname.</p>  <p>Will there be a problem regarding my name in the country I visit with a tourist or employment visa? Are there countries in the world where this might be a problem?</p> 
34243	Pricing and booking mixed-class fares, with economy & premium economy combined?	<p>So I find myself flying mixed-class fares pretty often these days, with the long legs in Premium Economy and the short hauls in plain old Economy.  Some sample trips flown or planned:</p>  <ol> <li>SYD-AKL-SFO (NZ), with SYD-AKL in Economy and AKL-SFO in Prem Econ</li> <li>SYD-SFO-LAS (UA), with SYD-SFO in Economy Plus and SFO-LAS in Economy</li> <li>ZRH-DXB-SYD (EK/QF), with ZRH-DXB in EK Economy and DXB-SYD in QF Prem Eco</li> </ol>  <p>Problem is, none of the booking engines I know handle this.  For example, if I select "Premium Economy" in my usual favorite, <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/">ITA Matrix</a>, it interprets this as "must fly in prem eco <em>or better</em>" and thus doesn't find #1 at all, instead offering $9,000 fares via Hong Kong or something (because there's no Prem Eco for SYD-AKL), and for #2 it quotes me SFO-LAS in First.  None of the airline sites listed above seem to cater to this either, except -- oddly enough -- for award redemptions.  I usually end up getting quotes for plain old economy and asking actual human travel agents how much an upgrade would cost, but this is slow and inconvenient for everybody involved.</p>  <p><strong>So is there a booking engine that lets me specify "fly in premium economy if you can, but economy if not"?</strong></p> 
39263	Indian Passport first page ripped - is this considered 'damaged'?	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hs8hN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Hi All, My passport first page got ripped.

27100	Cheapest flight to anywhere at any given time	<p>I'm looking to take a spontaneous trip for a long weekend. The date is flexible and the destination can be anywhere in the world.

23692	Travel site that found the lowest-price tickets from your current location	<p>Some time ago I had a bookmark to an awesome travel site, which I've lost. I'm hoping someone else used it.  The site was very minimal. You told it where you currently are, and it showed you the cheapest flights either in the next three days, or the whole month, from your current city. Ie, you didn't specify where you wanted to <em>go</em>, you specified where you <em>were</em>, and it told you where you could go.</p>  <p>If it helps narrow it down, I remember the website had a rotating set of background photos of various places, and the UI was very minimal and sat in a small rounded rectangle in the screen center.</p>  <p>Ie, the UI was a nice photo, and then in the very center of the screen, a small rounded-rectangle for search and results.  It was very distinctive.</p>  <p>It was a nice approach to travel planning, leading to spontaneous trips, quite unlike all other search sites I've used, and I'd like to find it again.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>This question is not a duplicate of "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/730/how-can-i-do-a-broad-search-for-flights">How can I do a broad search for flights?</a>"</strong> I am not looking for a general broad search   engine.

(For example, where in that question does it mention the site I'm looking for? I'll answer: it doesn't.

730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
39293	What's a better way to find flights when cost is important and schedule is not?	<p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/730/how-can-i-do-a-broad-search-for-flights">How can I do a &quot;broad&quot; search for flights?</a> is pretty broad, but not broad enough.</p>  <p>Rome2Rio.com (example) says I can go from FSM to MAD for $340 US but refuses to tell me date or airline.</p>  <p>matrix.itasoftware.com says that if I can tolerate 150+ ground miles at either end, the cheapest thing in the next six months is $1761.</p>  <p>skyscanner.net offers tons of options, then gives me an empty calendar on which I must pick a <strong>single day</strong>.</p>  <p>Most sites demand you at least know the week and won't define "nearby."</p>  <p>I said FSM to MAD only because that's what Rome2Rio said was cheapest.  I have plenty of time and can easily use many other airports.  Maybe Rome2Rio is lying—it <strong>always</strong> says that ITA is cheating me.</p> 
26780	Is there a flight search engine that combines flights from different airlines?	<p>Is there a search engine that considers "mix&amp;match" flight combinations?</p>  <p>My current problem: I need to go from FRA to YLW (Frankfurt/Germany to Kelowna/Canada) on July 29th, and arrive no later than 5pm. The search engines I checked only offer €3000+ flights.</p>  <p>I found a 2-stop combo through LHR and YVR for half that price. I'll probably have to check my baggage out and back in twice, but if the layover times are long enough, who cares?</p>  <p>A <em>real</em> search engine could find that for me (or something that's even better). Or, hell, give me a place to bulk-download the flight schedules from and I'll program it myself (of course I'd also need a way to check seat availability …).</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Please read before answering. A search engine which does this should, at minimum, show the flight combination through LHR which I found manually. Note that I need to arrive before 5pm, <em>on the same day</em>.</p>  <p>Also note that this is a generic question; I'm not looking for a specific good flight here -- but the details are useful to illustrate whether an answer is actually valid. :-/</p>  <p>NB: Typo, should have been July 29th.</p>

The short-term requirements are mentioned by the <a href="http://erbilresidency.com/shortterm.php" rel="nofollow">Kurdistan Regional Government</a> and include:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Evidence that the applicant has undertaken a blood test according to the procedures of the residence office. A form to obtain a blood test appointment can be collected from the residence office as part of the application process. The blood test result can usually be obtained within 2-3 days.  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Given eg that <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Iraqi_Kurdistan" rel="nofollow">Wikitravel</a> has “<em>… a compulsory blood test to check for Hep C and HIV (although this does not seem to be the case anymore).</em>” which site best reflects or what is the current situation regarding the blood test requirements?</p>  <p>Evidence of the current ‘de facto’ situation conflicts with stated official guidance. I seek an answer that disambiguates the situation rather than merely repeats one or other of the conflicting versions.

11615	Which is the cheapest way to get to Vietnam from Europe in summer?	<p>The complete question is: Which is the cheapest way to get to Vietnam in summer by flying from Europe? I'm planning a one-month trip to Vietnam for this summer, but I cannot find any reference on what airlines fly from anywhere in Europe to anywhere in Vietnam with or without stops.</p>  <p>In a forum (sorry I've lost the link) somebody told the cheapest is to fly to Bangkok and then fly with Air Asia to Vietnam. Is that the cheapest way? In this case, which is the cheapest route to BKK from Europe?</p>  <p>EDIT: As requested, my country is Spain, but my experience is that Ryanair could take you anywhere in Europe for just 30-60 €, while taking off from Madrid is about 100-300 € more expensive than the same in other european cities. The idea is stay about 4-5 weeks from the first week of july to mid september, but it is also "negotiable" (I have a very flexible work).</p> 
27151	How does the SNCF Voyageur program work?	<p>I'm planning some TGV trips soon, but despite being a member of two different Railteam frequent traveller programs already, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9662/can-i-credit-travel-on-one-railteam-member-to-the-frequent-traveller-program-of">from this question</a> it doesn't look like I'd be able to credit the journeys on a TGV to either of them.</p>  <p>I think, if I want to get any credit for them, I'll need to join the <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">SNCF Voyageur Program</a>. The <a href="http://www.sncf.com/en/loyalty/voyageur-programme">English language website for it</a> has some broad details about the program, but doesn't really explain much about how you earn credit from TGV journeys, nor about redeeming them. It links through to various French language websites, but these all seem to have even less information on them, with all the important details apparently only available after you log in. (Since joining seems to take about a week, you can't just sign up and immediately see the details, grr....)</p>  <p>If someone with better google-fu than me, or someone who's a member who can log in to the site to get the full details, is able to post about the program that would be great. Specifically, I'm interested in:</p>  <ul> <li>What tickets I can and can't get credit for</li> <li>What's the earnings rate (per segment, per mile, per euro, something else?)</li> <li>How do the different levels work?</li> <li>How do the rewards work?</li> </ul>  <p>Hopefully from that, I can work out if there's actually any point in me joining the program for just a few trips or not!</p> 
38489	Qatar - Doha - Lounge Options	<p>I am traveling to Vietnam soon and will have a ~6 hour layover in Doha. Since this is quite some time to kill and my connecting flight leaves at 1am from Doha I am wondering about cheap options for lounges in Doha.</p>  <p>Am I eligible to enter any lounge cheaper (or for free) with my Diners Club or MasterCard?</p>  <p>Am I allowed to enter any lounge at all if my flight is economy?</p>  <p>What are the costs and services available?</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
27100	Cheapest flight to anywhere at any given time	<p>I'm looking to take a spontaneous trip for a long weekend. The date is flexible and the destination can be anywhere in the world. Is there a site that would allow me to search airfares within a date range, while keeping the destination parameters open? </p>

26828	How can I buy an economy ticket one-way from Tahiti to Easter Island?	<p>I am trying to price flights for a South Pacific trip. Easter Island can be reached from either Santiago, Chile, or Tahiti. Flights from island to island within the South Pacific (eg Fiji to Samoa or New Caledonia to Vanuatu) tend to run about 300 per person. Some are a little less, some a little more. But PPT-IPC is $1300 per person, no matter where I look. Expedia, Travelocity, Cheapo Air, Matrix by ITA, LAN's own site, you name it. And when I look a little closer, this prices is, it turns out, almost always for a business class ticket. For example from ITA:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LvVQU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Is this an all-business flight? Why can't I find economy prices on this route?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> This seems to be related to its being one way. Return tickets are hard to find because there is only 1 flight a week in each direction. But for example on LAN if I choose return PPT-IPC March 10th, IPC-PPT March 16th, I can get $750 per person in O class. If I could throw away the return I would save over $500 per person, but what I would prefer is to buy the O class one way - especially since I don't intend to move to Easter Island, so I will be leaving it, and I will be leaving it on a LAN flight, so annoying them with dropped segments is a bad idea.</p> 
35501	When's the best time to fly with kids	<p>I'm about to take my son on a trip overseas, should I book a early morning flight or book a afternoon flight ? Taking in the time difference we would arrive at his bed time if we took afternoon flight</p> 
38488	Airplane ticket booked under my middle name	<p>I use my middle name pretty much everywhere.  At work I used to book travel myself and would always book under my first and last name.  We recently hired an admin who booked travel using my middle and last name.</p>  <p>Jet blue refused to change the ticket (or perhaps wasn't able to?).  The only option was to cancel the flight and re-book it at the last minute price, of course.  The other option is to show up to the flight and risk TSA refusing to let me travel.</p>  <p>Any advice?</p> 
8788	How strict are European budget airlines in terms of enforcing hand luggage?	<p>In Australia, I've never seen anybody get done for having carry-on luggage that's too big. It's pretty much whatever you can fit in the top compartments. In fact, I've seen people carry more than one hand luggage.</p>  <p>I'll be going to Europe soon and plan on taking a flight whilst there (Nice to Venice on EasyJet). So I think I'll buy one checkin 20kg bag. I don't think I'll need anymore as that's probably quite a lot but I have noticed that any extra kg above 20 kg seems to start to incur a lot more cash (esp. if you buy it at the airport). So if I do get to a position where I'm a little bit over, I'll be looking to find ways to store as much into my hand luggage as possible.</p>  <p>So just wondering, what are the airlines generally like in Europe? Are they fairly strict on ensuring that the size and weight of hand luggage is within their limits or are they fairly relaxed just as long as you don't try to bring an elephant onboard?</p> 
2939	What can I do to prevent passport stamps being put on blank pages?	<p>I'm running low on blank passport pages which are sometimes needed for full page visas such as those issued by Armenia, India, and Vietnam.</p>  <p>When I crossed the border into Turkey the other day I got my visa-on-arrival and stamp, but instead of putting it on a partly used page, which I have many, the guy at customs and immigration put them on a previously blank page. Now I have one fewer!</p>  <p><strong>What can I do to prevent or at least reduce the chances of this happening?</strong></p>  <p>It's worth remembering that there's likely to be a language barrier and it's always best to be ultra-nice to these border officials.</p>  <p>Has anybody heard of any trick such as sticking bit of paper in your passport, either blank, or looking a bit like visas? I have noticed that nobody ever stamps a page that has a remnant of something once stapled in there in Japan. There is a kind of stub that had its major part torn off along a perforation. Might I be able to emulate this somehow or would that even be worse making the blank pages invalid for full page visas due to having holes from staples? I know some things can get very picky when it comes to customs and immigration.</p> 
6	How can I visit Antarctica?	<p>A year ago I was reading some magazine, and found out that there is availability to get a trip to Antarctica.<br> Unfortunately, there was no info about how I could get there.<br> Do you know anything about it?

42808	How many days a year is a U.S. citizen allowed to stay in Morocco?	<p>I arrived in Morocco in October of 2014 and renewed my visa by traveling to Spain by ship for a day and getting my passport stamped again in January of 2015. My question is, am I allowed to leave the country and repeat this process this year by traveling again to another country, other than my own in order to return to Morocco for another 90 days? And if so, how many times a year is this allowed? I have read 180 days on some websites but there is not any clear answers anywhere about this that I can find. </p> 
10898	For a UK rail delay, which train company do you claim compensation from?	<p>For those who don't know, the UK rail network was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail">largely privatised</a> in the 1990s. Whether or not rail privatisation is a good thing is still very much up for debate, but even most pro-privatisation people feel the way it was done wasn't the right way! One upshot is that most non-trivial journeys will involve travel on trains operated by more than one train company.</p>  <p>Let's consider a hypothetical journey, A to D with a change of trains at C. The A-C journey is to be operated by TrainCoA, C-D by TrainCoB. Unfortunately, the A-C train is cancelled, so you end up getting a later train A-B, another B-C, and then a later train than you'd planned C-D. Oh, and then the C-D train you eventually caught was very late too. Everything was bought on a single ticket.</p>  <p>In this situation, which train company do claim compensation from? TrainCoA, as their initial cancellation was your first delay? TrainCoB, as their C-D delay was the largest delay on your journey? TrainCoC, who ran the A-B journey that you got instead, as they were the first company who's trains you managed to take? Or can you take advantage of the privatised nature of the system, review the compensation policies of all three train operating companies, and apply for compensation from whichever company has the most generous compensation for your sequence of delays? (Many of the companies have different minimum delays before compensation is due, and different exclusions on what their delay compensation covers....)</p>

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
34372	Cheapest way to meet	<p>I'm looking to meet a friend I originally met in China (she lives there, I'm from the US), ideally around Christmas. We don't need to meet in China, just anywhere in the world we can both get to that keeps the total cost of both (or just one of) our traveling the cheapest. I've been having a hard time finding services that don't require a predetermined city to travel to. The best I've found so far is Google Flight Maps, but even that has limitations. Does anyone know of something better?</p> 
42380	How do non-English speakers navigate through international airports (specific question about Amsterdam)	<p>A relative will visit me in Amsterdam. She does not speak English or any other major language, nor has much experience with air travel. How do people in similar situations find their way? </p>  <p>She will arrive with a flight from outside the Schengen area, but she does not need a visa for EU. The airline is from her country, so until landing there will be no language barriers. However, afterwards, I don't know how will she find her way to the passport control (and talk with the officer), and so on. Schiphol is an easy airport to navigate, but still difficult for someone who is not used to airports and air travel, and without the knowledge of a major language.</p>  <p>What am I supposed to do? Does the airport organise assistance in such cases?</p>  <p>I will be waiting outside after the customs, but as far as I know there is no way for me to go "any closer" than that.</p> 
7955	How difficult is it to eat and drink during ramadan in Thailand and Malaysia?	<p>Next month I'll visit Thailand and (maybe) Malaysia. From 19th july to 20th august muslim countries celebrate the ramadan. When we were in Egypt, we didn't perceive that we were in ramadan, but in Dubai we had a lot of problems to eat or drink. So I would like to know which limitations or how easy-difficult is to eat and drink during ramadan in Thailand and Malaysia.</p>

British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>  <p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p>

Most flights that go to NRT now from MEM are around $2000 these days. So, I was wondering if I took the MEM to HKG and HKG to MEM round-trip flight, then I could change my baggage final destination to NRT instead of HKG and leave the airport when I get to NRT. Once I leave Japan, I could check-in at NRT and then just use MEM as my final destination. Is that a successful itinerary? What issues would there be? This is on Delta.</p>

38393	Road Conditions on drive from Washington, DC to Quebec City over Christmas	<p>** Revised based on comments</p>  <p>We are planning a road trip from Washington DC to Quebec City around the 3rd week of December, following the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Washington,+DC/Quebec+City,+QC,+Canada/@42.7555024,-78.8856666,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c6de5af6e45b:0xc2524522d4885d2a!2m2!1d-77.0368707!2d38.9071923!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cb8968a05db8893:0x8fc52d63f0e83a03!2m2!1d-71.242796!2d46.8032826" rel="nofollow">route</a> prescribed by Google Maps (broadly, Interstate 95 to NJ Turnpike to I-95 to NY Route 17 to Interstate 87/Autoroute15 to Autoroute 20).</p>  <p>My question is, <em>during that time of the year, how safe are the roads for driving, considering inclement weather, such as snow storms?</em></p> 
7319	Is it always wise to book flights as soon as possible?	<p>So I'm booking flights to go to Europe in September n October.</p>  <p>And it's a long way off, but I've already noticed in the space of a week or so, that the prices have started creeping up. Not by much, but I've just realized that generally, the prices I was quoted a week ago is now a little bit more expensive.</p>  <p>Then again, out of interest, I've looked for earlier flights in like August or July, and some are even cheaper, so I don't know if it's just the general fluctuation of prices or if the flights on the dates I've set are really getting more expensive.</p>  <p>I kind of presumed that airlines have a kind of first in, best dressed type policy where the first couple of seats they sell on a flight is cheap then progressively more expensive?</p>  <p>But is that how it works? If so, on any given flight, a seat is not going to be any cheaper than it is now and therefore I should just book as soon as I can. Or should I be holding out for a while and monitoring prices until I get the price that I want and buying then? </p> 
2952	Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?	<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>  <p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>  <p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p> 
36760	UK visa refused, now I want to reapply but didn't mention my family last time - what to do?	<p>I applied for a tourist visa to UK. I am a student at university. I gave them proof that I am studying at my university. I got refused because he was not satisfied that I will go to UK and come to Egypt again and I didn't get him a document to prove that I will stay the next year in my university (I don't know how can to get that document). I have a British uncle who lives in London but when I was applying for the first time I wrote in my application that I don't have any family members in the UK. Now if I want to apply again what should I do? Can I make my uncle send me an invitation or  will that be too risky for me as that'll expose my previous lie? Will that get my application refused?</p> 
13368	Can I participate in the farming/harvesting of chocolate/cacao as a tourist anywhere in the world?	<p>Even us chocolate lovers don't know much about where chocolate comes from. It comes from a plant. Can tourists help out where it is grown anywhere?</p>  <p>Apparently most cacao/cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana in Africa, and there are stories of child labour and even child trafficking in the industry. I'm not sure if this would make it more dangerous to participate here. Or maybe the presence of organizations working to prevent illegal child labour would make it easier for a tourist to get involved.</p>  <p>But besides Africa it also apparently produced in Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia and in many parts of Latin America, both Central America and South America.</p>  <p>I remember once buying some cocoa beans with a friend in a small indigenous market town near Oaxaca in Mexico so it must be produced in the Valles de oaxaca for instance.</p>  <p>I guess some kind of eco-farm or finca that takes tourists as volunteers would be the best options, but I'm open to anything, and likely to travel in any region on my future trips. It would be great to get some hands-on chocolate farming experience!</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>BONUS</strong> I didn't think of this at the time I asked my question, but if there's some place that does the whole process from growing cacao to making chocolate bars that would be perfect. As far as I know most cacao is grown in developing countries but made into what we know as chocolate in developed countries.</p> 
39410	Driving from El Calafate to Torres del Paine National Park and back?	<p>I will be traveling to Patagonia in January with few friends and wanted to know if I could drive to Torres del Paine.</p>  <p>Specifically, we were thinking of:</p>  <ol> <li>Renting a car in El Calafate</li> <li>Driving to Torres del Paine</li> <li>Parking in Torres del Paine while we hike the 'W' trail</li> <li>Driving back to El Calafate.</li> </ol>  <p>Any advice would be appreciated. Though I guess, I am most concerned about whether it is possible (or safe) to park somewhere in Torres del Paine, and whether we will run into trouble crossing the Argentina-Chile border.</p> 
25531	Lufthansa connecting flight at Munich, only 45 minutes in between. Will I be able to make it?	<p>I bought a single ticket from Lufthansa, of Mumbai to Paris. My first flight (LH765) lands at 5:55am at Munich, from where I have another Lufthansa flight (LH2226) to Paris at 6:40am. This is a single ticket so I guess its responsibility of the airline to get me on the second flight, but since it's Non-Schengen to Schengen, will customs etc. be a problem? I am assuming the checked-in luggage would transferred automatically by the airline. Will I be able to make it?</p>

18918	What are the drawbacks of taking this window/aisle solo seat - 71A on Boeing 777-300ER?	<p>I've got an LA to Hong Kong flight coming up and I've never flown for that long before. Flying on boeing 777-200. Btw I'm not asking about window vs aisle, I definitely want an aisle seat. However it appears 71A is both window and aisle. This is the basis for my inquiry, to confirm that the window addition only adds benefit to the situation and does not take away from the aisle characteristics.</p>  <p>I'm looking for an aisle seat so 1) I can stretch my legs out 2) get to the bathroom and 3) walk around if I need to 4) minimize exposure to loud noise (engines/machines) or bad smell. Right now I have seat 69G, it's in the aisle and could possibly be bumped into by people walking by. But it works for all criteria I mentioned.</p>  <p>Having a window view would be an added bonus, would seat 70A have any extra exposure to loud noise or bad smell? It is closer to a bathroom, do bathrooms smell on long haul flights? </p>  <p>SeatGuru says "seats in close proximity to a bathroom can be bothersome," what are the common bothersome issues people express due to sitting by a bathroom?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uajP1.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>It almost seems like I'd be able to get the same benefits I want from an aisle seat but also the view? </p>  <p>Would sound be louder in this window seat?</p> 
25453	Is it normal/expected to tip taxi drivers in the UK?	<p>I've lived in the UK all my life, but since I have got relatively few <em>shared</em> taxis in my life, I don't have that much experience of what the social norms are for tipping.</p>  <p>I almost always tip roughly 10% (to nearest pound, <em>occasionally</em> to nearest 50p as long as that's MORE than 10%), just because that's what my parents taught me.</p>  <p>Is tipping required? Expected? A bonus? </p>  <p>I occasionally don't tip - would that reflect badly on me or would the driver not think anything of it? </p>  <p>When people do tip, how much is the norm?</p>

5695	Where is the safest place in a train?	<p>This morning I had to make a small (2-3 hours) train journey with a friend. He is a little anxious and unreasonable, and doesn't trust public transport. He won't fly at all and normally, he doesn't take the train, because he says it is too dangerous. Normally, he only trusts himself when he is the driver of his car. But today it was necessary to take the train.</p>  <p>During the journey, we had a discussion about the safest place in a train. I'm convinced that the safest places are in the back of the train, since normally, if a train has an accident, it either hits something head-on or the engine derails. So I assume that the impact is lower in the back of the train.</p>  <p>My friend argues that the places at the front of the train are safer. He has various reasons for that: </p>  <ol> <li>In case of emergency it is more probable that the electronic is working in front of the train. Therefore it is easier to open doors and get out of the train. He compares that with seats on a place directly around a emergency exit. </li> <li>The driver of a vehicle always protects his side unconsciously. I can follow this argument in case of a car, but how should it work in a train? </li> <li>Cars at the end of a train have a higher chance to derail.</li> </ol>  <p>So I'm not sure who is right. Are there any statistics about safest places in a train? I know that such things exists for planes, but how is it in trains? I would really like to persuade my friend, so that we can travel more together by train.</p> 
19241	Can a normal backpacker obtain a multiple-entry Chinese visa while on the road?	<p>I'm an Australian citizen backpacking around Southeast Asia, currently in Bangkok. I would like to criss-cross China several times on this trip to visit some of its neighbouring country by crossing land borders. So I need to apply for a multiple-entry tourist visa for China.</p>  <p>At the time I originally asked this question I had hunted for information on this and finally found <sup>(on a <a href="http://www.visaforchina.org/KUL_EN/visainstruction/256948.shtml" rel="nofollow">page</a> that's now a dead link)</sup> what seem to be extra prerequisites for multiple-entry tourist visas that are not necessary for single entry visas:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>(vii) If applicant can furnish one of the following documents, applicant may apply for multiple-entry L-Visa:<br>   (1) Real estate certificate in China (original and photocopy); or<br>   (2) Notarized kinship or marriage certificate (original and photocopy); or<br>   (3) At least twice China immigration entry records and photocopy.  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Another site user has found <a href="https://visasdirect.com.au/china-visa.php" rel="nofollow">another current page here</a> with a similar list.</p>  <p>I don't even know what some of these things are. Does this mean it's not possible for a backpacker to get a multiple-entry visa? Does anybody have experience with this? Would the fact that I'm not applying in my home country present an extra problem?</p>  <p>If the rules or the actual practice of the application process varies from country to country, is Bangkok a better or worse place to apply, or would I be better off postponing it and applying in another country in Southeast Asia?</p> 
43120	Will having used one previous double-entry visa for China make me eligible for a multiple entry visa now?	<p>China has a rule that to obtain a multiple entry visa you must be able to show immigration information for two previous stays, not always in very clear English.</p>  <p>Now just over a year ago in late 2013 and early 2014 I visited China two times on a double-entry visa that I obtained in Laos <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19241/can-a-normal-backpacker-obtain-a-multiple-entry-chinese-visa-while-on-the-road">after asking a previous question</a> on the site about Chinese multiple-entry visas.</p>  <p>This time I have a narrower question. I intend to visit China again in just over a month and would really like a true multiple-entry visa this time so that I can cross over land borders into China's neighbours and back more times (I don't have an exact plan).</p>  <p>So will my two previous visits on a single two-entry visa satisfy this condition, or must it definitely be two physically separate visas?</p> 
23548	Is layover of 1hr enough at Nassau Airport to catch flight to Eleuthera?	<p>We will be arriving from USA to Nassau and our connecting flight leaves exactly 1hr after we arrive so is that enough time to catch it when going to ELH (N. Eleuthera)?</p>  <p>Is there a customs line we have to go thru?</p>  <p>We can take a different flight that is a 1-stop and get there in enough time but that means leaving at 5am in the morning plus a 1-stop also may have it's own set of issues so should we chance it?</p> 
34066	How can I extend my stay within the Schengen area -- apply for a second visa?	<p>So my problem is that I have a Schengen Visa delivered by the Spanish Embassy, valid from August 01st 2014 to September 19th with a 35 days stay duration with one entry. I'm gonna be in Spain from August 3rd until September 6th, which is the limit of my 35 days, and then I want to go to Germany to stay there for some time.</p>  <p>Can I apply for a Schengen visa from German Embassy from 6th or 7th of September? </p>  <p>If yes, will I have to leave the Schengen space and return to it?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
5925	What does a surcharge for departure dates mean for an round the world ticket?	<p>I was looking for <a href="http://www.flightcentre.com.au/flights/product/Round+the+World-2154579" rel="nofollow">around the world tickets</a> and I noticed the following text:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Valid for departures 16 Jan 2012 - 3 Jun 2012 &amp; 4 Oct 2012 - 2 Dec   2012. ADD $140* for departures 4 Jun 2012 - 3 Oct 2012 &amp; 3 Dec 2012 - 15 Jan 2013.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Does that generally mean that you are charged $140 if your <em>first</em> flight is between the marked dates, or that you are charged $140 for each flight that is between the marked dates? Of course, I wouldn't buy anything without asking an official representative to clarify the situation.</p> 
26	What should I know about "Around The World" flights?	<p>I have heard rumours of such things, and have had a difficult time find information on "around the world" flights.  Are they worth it (do you have a limit between usage, do you save money.. etc.) and are there easy ways of getting more informed on them (specific sites, travel agencies)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> With the goal of maximum continental coverage, no specific start or finish locations</p> 
42820	UK PLAB Visa Refusal	<p>I had applied for a PLAB (Doctors) Visa for the UK to appear in PLAB test. I got refused on the basis of two recent large deposits in the bank statement I provided (my mothers). In reality, these are my own savings which I had deposited in her account to make it more strong. The only objection I got was that I must provide evidence for the source of these deposits. Other than this, I have previously travelled to the UK and USA as well as other parts of the world and my travel history is fine. Can someone please advise on how to proceed and re-apply?</p> 
27096	I am flying overseas and returning with my fiancee. How do I coordinate the flights so that we are together on the return leg?	<p>In the next two months I will be flying overseas to the Philippines to pick up my fiancee. I will be booking a round trip ticket, and will need to find a way to book her a ticket on the same route back as my return leg… but I can't seem to figure out a good way to do this.</p>  <p>Would I be better off booking two round-trip tickets, and let her seat fly empty for the trip there? Is this something where I would be better off using a travel agent instead of trying to book online or direct?</p> 
23665	Why do UK people stand on the right on escalators?	<p>UK uses left-hand traffic. Traffic flows on the left side, people walk on the left. Is there any reason to stand on the right while using escalators?</p> 
43168	How can I do an online broad search for cruise trips?	<p>I like to travel in cruise ships, but for me it's usually hard to decide on an itinerary. I've never found a web site that allows me to compare cruise trips, so I have to search in many cruise companies (<a href="http://www.costacruise.com/" rel="nofollow">Costa</a>, <a href="http://www.msccruises.com/" rel="nofollow">MSC</a>, <a href="http://www.royalcaribbean.com/" rel="nofollow">Royal Caribbean</a>...) and compare their fares and itineraries.</p>  <p>It seems to me that cruise planning is not as advanced as flying. Last time I took a Costa cruise (it was a little over 1 year ago) I couldn't buy it online! I had to go to a travel agent and buy through it. Even though, I suspect there should be a website to help those that want to cruise, but I'm just not aware of.</p>  <p>Specifically, I'm looking for a tool like <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/" rel="nofollow">Skyscanner</a>, <a href="http://adioso.com/" rel="nofollow">Adioso</a>, <a href="http://www.kayak.com/" rel="nofollow">Kayak</a> (and the like), that would allow me to enter a date (or a date range) and places (perhaps a country or a region) and search for cruise ships that would be in those places within the date range supplied.</p> 
17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p> 
40645	Is there a website that summarizes the luggage and check-in requirements for each airplane company?	<p>I don't travel much by plane but I use a wide variety of companies. Since there is not much harmonization, specially with LCC, each one has its own requirements about luggage size, weight, extra luggage price, need for on-line check-in and printed ticket.</p>  <p>Each time I fly I ask my self what are the requirements, and although I can check them online at the official website this can't be quick, sometimes I leave it for last or, with so many, I just confuse airline requirements.</p>  <p>Is there a website or resource that lists this information? This would be very useful to quickly check or just compare requirements.</p> 
42531	Historical airfare prices to understand which month has the lowest airfare	<p>Is there a service (don't mind paying a bit) that will tell me historically which month has the lowest airfare between two travel destinations? The thing is, that I need to fly to India from Canada (return trip) to see my family every year but I am flexible with time of visit. </p>  <p>So it will be helpful if I could get an idea when the airfare for this route is historically low.</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
11165	Is it possible to walk between all three terminals in Dubai Airport without leaving airside?	<p>we are arriving into Terminal 2 on the 28th Dec and want to go to the business lounge in terminal 1 before getting a flight from terminal 3 eight hours later.

43279	How can I check when I can (statistically) fly to given locations most cheaply?	<p>There are many sites where I can search for a particular flight with various date ranges and compare the prices.</p>  <p>But, say, I want to go from Warsaw to New York, or London, or anywhere else (the location is just an example). But I have 100% flexibility when I'll go. How can I check in which part of the year the flight prices on the given route tend to be the most attractive?</p>  <p>I'm aware the prices are very volatile, but if there's a general trend that the flights to London are cheapest in May, and to New York in October, it would greatly help me to start planning.</p> 
39339	Can I have multiple valid ESTAs in different passports?	<p>I'm a citizen of country X and have a valid United States ESTA in my X passport.  Recently, I became of citizen of Y and now have a Y passport as well, which I would like to use for future travel to the US.  Both countries qualify for the Visa Waiver Program.  <strong>Can I have ESTAs in both passports at the same time?</strong></p>  <p>The official CBP site seems contradictory, first <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073/~/apply-or-change-information-in-the-electronic-system-for-travel-authorization" rel="nofollow">implying that I should get a new ESTA</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you obtain a new passport or change your name, gender or <em>country of   citizenship, you will be required to apply for a new travel   authorization</em>. This is also required if one of your answers to any of   the VWP eligibility questions changes. The associated fee of $14 will   be charged for each new application.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And then <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1096/~/esta---eligible-passport,-country-of-issuance,-citizenship" rel="nofollow">saying that I should not have two simultaneous ESTAs</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you have dual citizenship and have registered with ESTA, you should   use your VWP-eligible passport to board the plane when you leave your   country of departure and when you arrive in the U.S. If both your   countries of citizenship are VWP-eligible, then we strongly recommend   you choose which one you want to claim for purposes of travel to the   U.S., and use that country's passport each time you travel. <em>One person   with two different ESTA authorizations creates confusion that will   only delay your travel.</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>Cancelling the old ESTA would seem a valid way to fulfill both requirements, but there doesn't appear to be any way to do this?</p> 
5755	What is the cheapest way to get from South America to Australia	<p>What is the cheapest way to get from South America to Australia? </p>  <p>I found several flights mostly from Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile, however the prices are quite prohibitive.

5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
17969	When travelling internationally with valuable personal effects, how do I avoid paying duty at each border crossing?	<p>Some people travel internationally with valuable personal effects.  The most obvious example is photography equipment which could easily be valued over $15k.  Jewelry, watches, and specialized medical or sports equipment (think expensive bicycle) also seem likely expensive personal effects that people might travel with.</p>  <p>For most countries it seems that personal effects are not subject to duties (see also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/10934/3067">"Customs and Duties" of this answer</a>).  Of course, this depends on the customs official accepting your claim that the items you are importing are personal effects.  If a customs official rejects your claim that they are, in fact, personal effects, it seems clear that you would have to pay duty on the items.  While this seems uncommon, there are reasonably credible stories about travelers being charge import duties the personal items they are traveling with including <a href="http://photofocus.com/2010/07/29/u-s-based-photographers-traveling-abroad-beware-the-duty/">this one about photographers returning to the USA</a> and <a href="http://photo.net/travel-photography-forum/00XWYm">this one about a visitor to China's iPad</a>.</p>  <p>How do I avoid being charged duty on my valuable personal effects when I cross a border?</p>  <hr>  <p><em>This is probably <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11594/is-there-a-zip-code-i-can-enter-when-paying-at-the-pump-in-the-usa-with-a-foreig">one of those questions that will have a different answer for each country</a>, so I've left it country-agnostic.  <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/17970/3067">I've found the answer</a> for leaving and returning to the USA, but I really need an answer for traveling from Canada to Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, and back to Canada via Germany.</em></p>

22285	Can a hotel kick you out if you let an unregistered guest share a room with you?	<p>We are going to an event and because of this event all hotels are fully booked. Now a friend wants to join us, but can't find accommodation. We are okay with him crashing in our hotel room, either on the couch or on a self-inflatable mattress. We have done this in the past where we secretly sneaked the "guest" in. </p>  <p>It is not that we don't want to pay the tourist tax, it is that when ask and the hotel says no, we can't sneak him in, because we drew attention to ourself. In many hotels you can just order another bed, but there are also a lot that don't have that service. </p>  <p>I don't have any ethical problems with my behavior of secretly hosting a guest. I did pay for the room. I don't like being sneaky about it, since again I do pay for the hotel room. Also if I have to choose between sneaking someone in the room to crash on the couch or let him/her sleep on bench in the park. I opt for the first. </p>  <p>Am I just worrying to much and will being honest about it in the end be acceptable to most if not all hotels?</p> 
22293	What is proper etiquette on bringing one night stands to a hotel room?	<p>somewhat related to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/22285/">"Can a hotel kick you out if you let an unregistered guest share a room with you?"</a>:</p>  <p>In the, alas, completely hypothetical scenario where I'm out in a foreign town and just happen to meet someone, I wonder whether it would be acceptable to take them with me to my (single occupancy) hotel room. I'd expect that to differ a lot in different countries.</p>  <p>Always booking double rooms isn't a solution, since good things happen only when you don't expect them.</p> 
16860	Long (14-hour) layover in Beijing on a Sunday, will I be able to do some shopping/tourism?	<p>I just booked a ticket with a stop in Beijing. On my way back I will arrive in Beijing at 11:30 (Sunday), but my flight to UK is scheduled at 1:30 (Monday), more or less 14 hours. So I was thinking doing a little bit of tourism and maybe shopping (Maybe some gadgets). But I don't know if I'm going to find all the stores closed or something like that. In that case, what else can I visit during the day? I can imagine there will be no many people who can understand english, so I don't really know what are my options.</p>

20467	Transit visa for Narita	<p>My girlfriend and I are travelling to the Philippines in November of this year 2013. We fly with Air Canada to Narita Tokyo from there we fly with ANA airlines to Manilla. We have a 2:20 minute layover. I have a Canadian passport and she has a passport from the Philippines. When we return, we fly with Jetstar from Manilla to Tokyo where we have a 4:50 minute layover then fly with Air Canada to Toronto. My question is " Do we need transit visa's for Narita? And if we have to leave the terminal to catch our connecting flight in another terminal do we need a visa in that case.</p> 
9027	Layover at Narita, Japan. Do I need a transit visa?	<p>I am travelling from Delhi to Chicago and have two stopovers in between, one at Narita, Japan, and the other at Dallas, US; so my trip looks like: <strong>DEL - NRT - DFW - ORD</strong>. I am an Indian citizen. I do not hold any type of a Japanese visa, but do have a valid US F1 visa. The layover at Narita is for 4 hours and 5 minutes. I am planning to stay within the airport during this period. Does anyone know if I will require a transit visa at Narita?</p> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p> 
39423	Schengen Visa for both business and tourism	<p>I am holding an Indian passport. I have a multi-entry Schengen visa which is valid for 6 months. I am planning to travel in mid Feb to Spain (on a business trip) via Netherlands for a week. On my way back I am planning to stay in the Netherlands for 4 days as a tourist. Do I need to apply for a tourist visa or can I use the Schengen visa which I applied for Spain?</p> 
25729	Is 1 hour and 30 mins enough time in Atlanta Airport?	<p>Is 1 hr and 30 mins enough time for first time travelers at Atlanta airport? I am flying first time from USA to Bombay and my first transit is at Atlanta. I assume I have to go from the domestic terminals to the international departures for which I have to take the "Light Train".</p>  <p>Is it easy to find the stations for those trains? Is it enough time to make it to the next flight?</p> 
36557	Why were water bottles confiscated in a boarding gate jetway in Hong Kong?	<p>Seeing another question about taking water bottles onto planes reminded me of an interesting incident I ran into once. During a layover in Hong Kong in late May of 2013, as we were boarding a flight to Los Angeles, there were security personnel actually in the jetway searching through everyone's carry-on luggage and confiscating water bottles that still had water in them. Since only empty bottles were allowed to get through security or transfer security to even get to the gate, this means that all of the water being confiscated was either purchased or obtained from a water fountain in the airside concourse. As such, I was confused as to why it was being confiscated. Also, this was not done on a different departure I had from Hong Kong only a couple of weeks before that or on any other flight I've ever been on anywhere.</p>  <p>So, my question is, <strong>does anyone know why they would confiscate water that was obtained in the secure departures area of the airport in the jetway as passengers were boarding a flight?</strong></p>  <p>The only even remotely reasonable explanation I could think of is that it could have something to do with taking extra precaution to prevent the spread of avian flu, since there was an outbreak in China at the time, though I didn't hear any kind of announcement of this not being allowed until we were already actually in the jetway past the boarding gate.</p>  <p>Less likely, this was during the time that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" rel="nofollow">Edward Snowden</a> was in Hong Kong, so perhaps this was a pretense to search luggage of U.S.-bound flights for some reason related to that, but this seems very unlikely, especially since this was between the time he arrived in Hong Kong and when he went public with the information.</p> 
36563	When are U.S.-bound flights required to confiscate liquids at the gate?	<p>In a <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/36557/why-were-water-bottles-conficated-in-a-boarding-gate-jetway-in-hong-kong">recent question</a>, I found that the U.S. requires flights from Hong Kong that are bound for the U.S. to confiscate liquids in containers above 100 mL from carry-on luggage in a secondary screening at the gate. However, this did not occur on a recent (June 2014) flight I took to the U.S. from Incheon, South Korea. I've also read forum posts where this has not applied to others going to the U.S. from Seoul or parts of Europe, but also where it has applied to those flying to the U.S. from some other places, including Latin America.</p>  <p>So, <strong>under what conditions are U.S.-bound flights required to confiscate liquids from carry-on items at the gate</strong> (as opposed to only confiscating them at security checkpoints and allowing items purchased airside to be taken on the plane, as happens on U.S. domestic flights?)</p>  <p>Is this only from certain countries whose primary screening isn't approved by the U.S. DoT (or DHS, as the case may be) for some reason? If so, is there a definitive list of which countries require (or, conversely, don't require) this check at the gate?</p>  <p>Is there an element of randomness to whether liquids acquired airside may be allowed on any given U.S.-bound international flight or is the procedure generally the same from a given departure point? It appears that, <a href="http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_US/travel-information/baggage/restricted-items/liquids-gels-aerosols-restrictions.html#2" rel="nofollow">at least in the specific case of Hong Kong</a>, the gate check is always applied, but I'm wondering about the general case of U.S.-bound international flights.</p>  <p>In order to limit the scope of the question, I'm not referring to items purchased in duty-free shops and the special rules and circumstances that may be involved with those. I'm just concerned with filling up or buying a water bottle or buying a soda or some such thing airside and taking it on the plane.</p> 
5167	Any travel booking sites that let you search for a mixed itinerary?	<p>Travel sites that search all the major air lines are a dime a dozen.  And in some localities, there are travel sites that at least pay lip service to searching major bus carriers.</p>  <p>But are there any travel sites that will search all major forms of transportation, and let you form a mixed itinerary? I'm thinking at least air, bus, and train.</p>  <p>For instance, if I want the cheapest way to get from Town A to Town B, I'd like options like:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Take Foo Bus Line from Town A to City Q</li>   <li>Fly Bar Airline from City Q to City Z</li>   <li>Take Baz Passenger Train from City Z to Town B</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>For bonus points, it might even include public transit options, in localities where it's actually feasible to take public transit between major cities.</p>

22864	Have I invalidated my own ESTA and if I fly to Mexico does that mean I will not be allowed back into the States?	<p>The ESTA that I entered the States on back in October was due to expire on January 8th. As I wished to stay a little longer (an extra couple of weeks) I searched the internet to see how this was possible. </p>  <p>On another forum I read that you could create a new ESTA, resetting the 90 days, by just filling in a new ESTA form and paying another $14, over-riding the dates already in place. I did this at the beginning of December, thinking it would give me until the end of February to leave the country. I now see that this was not intended for use as an extension and that it is instead intended for people who have not yet entered the country and wish to change their dates.</p>  <p>If I now attempt to 'retrieve' my ESTA online using the original application number it states that is has expired. I guess because I over-rode it with a new application. Am I now in breach and does this mean I will not be able to re-enter the country? </p>  <p>Also, I wanted to fly to Mexico, and then travel around Central and South America and then come back to America (maybe sometime in May or June) and fly home. I understand that Mexico is included in the visa waiver region - even though I will be travelling to other countries, will this also affect my ability to return to the country? Would it be better for me to fly to another country (I've heard Costa Rica is not included in the visa waiver region) and then travel to Mexico later - would this make a difference?</p>  <p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>  <p>Thanks Jo</p>

3616	Car rental in Japan	<p>Is it possible to rent a car in Japan with a Swedish drivers license? What is the traffic like? I figure that there is not much use in driving in the Tokyo or Osaka areas. What are the options for combining public transport with car rental. (To get into the countryside.)</p> 
21632	Japan: Car rental vs public transport	<p>I'm planning a trip through Japan at the moment and stumbling over the question of transport. I read that I (from Germany) need a translation of my driver's license (which should not be a problem), but also that apart from major highways, it might be difficult for foreigners to navigate the Japanese back-country.</p>  <p>Therefore I wanted to ask whether it's more viable to scratch that plan altogether and instead focus on railways and other public transport to go from place to place. The only obstacle I see in this plan would be that this might "skip over" interesting sights along the way, since you cannot just make a small detour along the way.</p>  <p>Am I wrong on any of those things? Am I putting too much thought on the topic?</p>

16031	Tourism on Schengen business visa (circulation)	<p>I am an Indian citizen living in UK on a tier 2 visa. Recently, I have received Short stay Schengen visas (multiple entry, business trips for 1 year) for travelling to France. (Applied at French embassy Edinburgh)</p>  <p>Unfortunately, the tickets I have provided in my visa application needs to be cancelled as my business trip got cancelled.

And moreover it is now for a tourism purpose. </p> 
20827	How to recognise/thank great cabin crew?	<p>Those of us who fly a lot will know that there is a bit of a variety in cabin crew. Some (sadly more common on certain airlines) do the very bare minimum to ensure a safe flight, but nothing more. Many (especially on airlines noted for good customer service) provide a good service.</p>  <p>Every so often though, you come across a flight crew who go the extra mile. These are the ones always friendly, always helpful, always thinking ahead and solving the problem before it has happened. One moment they're serving you your drink, the next reassuring a little old lady about the flight, the next magicing a colouring book to turn an impending toddler crisis into a happy small child, then answering queries on arrivals and immigration for a first time travaller, then back to offer you a top up of what you're drinking (which they've remembered exactly). Not very often found, but very much appreciated when you happen across them on your travels!</p>  <p>In the case when you do luck out and find yourself on a flight with a great cabin crew (who go well beyond what you normally experience as "good" on that airline/kind of airline), is there a standard/common way to recognise them at the end of the flight? Not just to thank them then and there, but also to let the airline know that this person/group are what the rest of their staff should be aspiring to. Is there any standard way, or does it vary entirely by carrier?</p>

43582	What are "prohibited / restricted areas" in the context of an Indian visa?	<p>Looking at the endorsements on my new Indian visa, one of the things it says is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Not Valid for Prohibited / restricted and Cantonment areas</p> </blockquote>  <p>How do I find out what those areas are, so I can ensure I don't accidentally end in one on my travels and get into trouble?</p>

I know it sounds subjective and it most certainly is but I read at some forums that it's not the course that matters, it's the instructors so if anyone tried scuba diving at Havelock island, please help me choose the most appropriate operator and the one that is the most responsible, safe or that can be described by any of the other diving-related adjectives.</p>  <p>These are diving operators that are listed in Lonely Planet's guide:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://diveindia.com/" rel="nofollow">Dive India</a></li> <li><a href="http://andamanbubbles.com/" rel="nofollow">Andaman Bubbles</a></li> <li><a href="http://barefootindia.com/" rel="nofollow">Barefoot Scuba</a></li> </ul>  <p>If you know any other, please don't hesitate to recommend them.</p>

19036	Can you travel to Canada by road with an expired US passport?	<p>Is it possible to leave and re-enter the US through the land border with Canada with an expired (US) passport? My passport expired in December and I didn't realize that until now. In addition to the expired passport, I have my naturalization certificate and Tennessee issued drivers license to prove citizenship and residency. Re-entry will be by road from Canada.</p>  <p>UPDATE:  I made some calls and was told that I needed a passport -- I was told to contact the regional passport agency in New Orleans (about 6 hours by road for me) get an appointment and show up in person with proof of imminent travel outside the country. After searching on the web, I located a few agencies who claimed that they could help with this for a charge of around $199. I picked the one that had good reviews and they helped take care of the problem. On Monday they walked me through different documents they needed, asked me to go to a "Passport Verification" agent in a post office to get everything verified and sealed in an envelope, had to FedEx the package to them. On Tuesday they got it, processed the passport and shipped it back to me. I got it Wednesday. In all it cost me $170 (Govt Passport Fee) + $25 (Verification fee at the post office) + $199 (Agency charge) + $90 (Shipping). Glad i got this taken care of. Thanks to everyone who helped with responses. </p> 
22697	Why do airlines prohibit having two infants in the same row?	<p>If a family is travelling with infants under 2 years old, these infants will not need a seat (of course you can buy them a seat if you want), and they can just sit in their parents' laps. Given that, why do airlines prohibit two infants from sitting in the same row (for example Seat A,B and C) at one side of the aisle? Why is it that one of the parent has to move to another row or to the other side of the row?</p>

43660	Traveling in Europe Solo - 18 years old. Feasible?	<p>My dream is to spend a month in Europe after graduating high school.  Based on my situation, I will have to travel alone since there is no one else here who would be able to make such a trip.  I am an Eagle Scout, have common sense, and am used to being independent.  My mom is worried that I will be in danger from thieves, muggers, or other unforeseen obstacles.  I plan on visiting the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, and Germany.  Communication should not be a problem since I speak French fluently and will speak Italian and German fairly well.</p>  <p>Here's my question: Will I be relatively safe traveling in Europe on my own for a month?  What dangers or obstacles in particular should I watch out for - are thieves, pickpockets, or muggers common in some areas?  Given that I have a limited budget of ~$3000, would I have enough to purchase basic necessities such as food, train tickets, and hostel rentals for a month?  What else, in particular, should I be aware of as an 18 year old traveling alone for the first time?</p> 
23438	Can I leave the UK and come back in, on a Tourist visa?	<p>I am a United States citizen with a 6-month Tourist visa to the UK (a stamp in my passport). Additionally, in 2013 I spent about two months in the UK on tourist visas, split between two separate occasions (one month in April-May, and one in August-September). My passport was stamped in December of 2013, and I have two other stamps from those previous visits (so three total, now)</p>  <p>My original intended departure date from the UK was March 1, but that is no longer the case, as I plan to stay out the duration of my visa.</p>  <p>My question is, can I leave the UK (to travel in Europe for a week, for example) and come back in with this visa? Will they re-stamp me, or see that my existing stamp is still valid? Will it be a problem that I've been coming-and-going in the UK relatively frequently? Are there any other concerns I should be aware of?</p>

38875	Vehicles required/allowed in weigh stations on US interstates	<p>On US interstates, there are weigh stations for trucks.</p>  <p>Are they for trucks only? What are the exact categories of vehicles that must/may enter?</p>  <ul> <li><p>If I rented a UHaul or Penske truck, would I be required to enter into an open weigh station?

22916	Can I pick up my luggage between flights with the same company?	<p>I have a flight from Madrid to Aalborg with a stop in Amsterdam. The connection time betweeen the flight from Amsterdam and Aalborg it´s 1 hour and a half. The thing is that I want to stay in Amsterdam for a week and I want to pick up my checked in luggage at the Amsterdam airport. Can I do that if the flight it´s with the same company (KLM for instance) ?</p>  <p>I mean I can tell them that I want to pick up my luggage in Amsterdam right?</p> 
35813	LDW / LIS for US car rental booked in UK	<p>If I book a rental car for a week in the US through the US website I can pay about $300 which becomes more like $550 if I take Loss Damage Waiver and Liability Insurance. But if I book from the UK website, I still pay the equivalent of about $300 but LDW and LIS are included in the price.</p>  <p>What gives? The hire-companies are apparently obliged to include LDW and LIS but why aren't they charging the same for it as they charge their US customers? Is it that much of a rip-off? Do few US customers take it because they have their own insurance? More importantly, is there a catch?</p> 
598	Where can I get information on freighter travel?	<p>I want to go from New York City to any destination in Europe on a freighter.  The only place I've found information for doing this requires a round trip.  I don't want to go round trip.  I want to spend some months in Europe and I don't care where in Europe I start.</p> 
9048	What is the cheapest available freighter voyage anywhere?	<p>Walking past a huge international shipyard twice today got me thinking about <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Freighter_travel">freighter travel</a>. We have a couple of such questions on the site, but not many.</p>  <p>Many people are surprised when they find out that freighter travel is often more expensive than flying and I just looked at the website of the Australian company "Freighter Expeditions" and found most of the trips listed even more expensive than I was expecting.</p>  <p>But this surely isn't the only company / website dealing in freighter travel - I just don't know where else to look?</p>  <p>My question is <strong>"What is the cheapest freighter travel trip available anywhere in the world?"</strong></p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else?

24639	What docs to show if I'm a US citizen with no US passport (but with another non-US passport) to re-enter the US	<ul> <li>Suppose I am a naturalized citizen of the US, but also a citizen of another country, "XYZ".</li> <li>I then boarded a plane and left the US to another country (maybe not necessarily to XYZ), without first getting a US passport, but using my old, but valid XYZ passport.</li> </ul>  <p><em>In this case what would be the best documents to have for me to gain entry back into the US as a US Citizen without a passport?</em></p>  <p>Would I need to contact the US Embassy for help in order to be able return?</p>  <p>If the airline does let me aboard to return to the US, with the US passport, what are the best documents could I show at the border to prove I am a US citizen but that I just don't have a passport, for whatever reason?</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
39468	At which embassy should I apply for a Schengen visa when staying a few days in several countries?	<p>I'm planning to go to Germany on Sept 6-8, then Netherlands on Sept 8-11 and exit Switzerland on Sept 11-14.</p>  <p>My question is:</p>  <p>Which embassy do I need to apply for the Schengen visa? The number of days are the same for Netherlands and Switzerland, but I'm planning to apply in Netherlands since it will be my second point of entry.</p> 
43258	Least Strict Schengen Visa Application? - France or Italy	<p>My wife and I would like to travel to Europe later this year. We live in the U.S.A. but she needs to obtain a Schengen Visa (short stay) as she is not a U.S. citizen (she's a permanent resident).</p>  <p>Our Itinerary looks like the following:</p>  <ol> <li>Entry into Barcelona, Spain (3 days)</li> <li>Travel to Rome (4 days)</li> <li>Travel to Paris (4 days)</li> <li>Exit from Paris</li> </ol>  <p>I've read that when visiting multiple places, you should apply for the Schengen Visa of the place you spend the most time in. We spend equal time in Italy and France - so the question is, which of these two countries should she apply for?</p> 
30878	Are foreigners targeted in the Xinjiang / Uyghur related violence in Western China?	<p>Recently here has been a fairly steady occurrence of violent events in Xinjiang or attributed to separatists from Xinjiang in other parts of the country.</p>  <p>Perhaps the biggest or most known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attack">took place in Kunming, Yunnan a few months ago</a> - a few months after I spent a week there. Another was <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/21/world/asia/china-police-station-attack/">in the news in Xinjiang itself just yesterday</a>.</p>  <p>I have heard that part of the Chinese government's response includes <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/xinjiang-tourism-bureau-pays-500-yuan-travelers-boost-struggling-tourism-following-terror-1591320">promoting tourism to Xinjiang, at least of Chinese</a> citizens if not for foreigners.</p>  <p>But I'm wondering how safe it is for foreign / western tourists. Obviously in a restive place there's an increased chance of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but I'm more concerned with whether foreigners are targeted in attacks of this kind, or if they're directed at Han Chinese, or if they are totally random.</p>  <p>I've been thinking of visiting this part of the world on my next trip. I don't avoid places that are "dangerous" but I do avoid places where tourists, foreigners, or westerners are specifically targeted.</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
22734	Where can we find information about the cause of a flight's delay?	<p>Having experienced a few flight delays on my own, I'd like to know if there is some source of precise information about the delay (including up-to-date estimations of the delay and causes). So far it seems to me the only people who can actually inform about it is the air company staff, at the airport, and via oral announcements only.</p>  <p>I'd expect this information to be some sort of obligation, since compensations are related to the cause of the delay (if it's weather, it's OK for the company, otherwise the passengers have more rights, and so on), but I could not find a reliable source for this. At best, websites such as <a href="http://www.flightstats.com/go/Home/home.do" rel="nofollow">FlightStats</a> indicate the estimated delay length, but never the cause (or probable cause).</p>  <p>Is this information available anywhere? I tried the airport's website and the flight company's website as well, but I couldn't find anything.</p>  <p>I see plenty of reasons why the company would not like to disclose this information, but I would expect some organism to enforce it.  </p>  <p>Besides, the fact that they currently inform the passengers only via oral announcements seems quite inefficient and prone to generate stress among the passengers (and extra work to ground staff, which is forced to repeat again and again the same information...).</p> 
13342	How to vomit during a flight?	<p>Last time I travelled I wasn't feeling quite well just before boarding the plane. I either had eaten something wrong or a flu just appeared. The thought of having to vomit during the flight made me panic a bit. The pocket in front usually contain these paper bags that act as a "<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3104/vomitorium-only-common-in-the-german-speaking-world">vomitorium</a>", but I can hardly imagine them being useful especially with the cramped space you have these days. I tried to induce some preemptive vomiting before boarding without success but luckily a good powernap before boarding did the trick to have a nice trip.</p>  <p>So what is the best approach to deal with a bad stomach during a flight or just before boarding. If your really feel like vomiting, where or how to do that best?</p> 
33891	Travel in the Schengen area after my residence card was lost or stolen	<p>I have already booked my flight from Italy to the Netherlands through Ryanair. I'm staying in Italy legally and have a <em>carta di soggiorno</em>. However, after booking my flight, my wallet was stolen, which contains all my IDs except my passport. I filed a police report, and I'm trying to get a new residence card. However, I need to go to the Netherlands ASAP. Will Ryanair accept the police report and receipt of getting a new residence card from the post office?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE (17.07.2014)</strong></p>  <p>Thanks for helping me out. BTW it's OK now. I went to our local CISL here in Florence, Italy, where they process your envelope for renewing your <em>permesso di soggornio</em> or <em>carta di soggiorno</em> (residence permit for foreigners) to be submitted to the post office. That's where you pay and get your postal receipt, and they make an appointment for you at the questura. Anyway, long story short, they processed a application for IMPROVISED residence permit which is good for 30 days to travel within the Schengen area, so all I have to do is go to the questura, bring my travel booking, the police report and copy of my passport. Now I can travel, and it's my first time to fly with Ryanair because I always use Transavia to go to Holland. =) Hope this helps for future persons who will have the same issue with lost or stolen residence permits...Just wish me luck that the questura will process my improvised residence permit immediately.</p> 
9234	Valid Indian visa in an expired passport	<p>I recently had to renew my passport.  The expired one has an Indian visa that will be valid until 2016.

10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year.

37251	Apply for a new visa when I still have a valid C visa but not enough days of stay?	<p>I have a valid c-type visa, multiple, 30 days, validity: 2/10/2014 - 2/1/2015 which I'd use this October for 12 days.</p>  <p>I plan to travel again entering Schengen 10/12/2014 and exit on 2/1/2015 . total 24 days. </p>  <p>Coincidentally, my current visa will still be valid until the day I exit Schengen. however I would have overstay the maximum 30 days stay of the visa.</p>  <p>TLS advise me to apply for a new visa, for the December trip to whichever is my main destination embassy. however, they are unclear of issuing the December visa if it is possible given old visa is still valid but not enough remaining days of stay?</p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
30471	Advice for flying with a 6 month old infant?	<p>We are going to have our first flight with our 6 month-old child. The flight will be 12 hours long.</p>  <p>Is there anything we need to pay special attention to? Anything we might overlook?</p>  <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>  <p>Ok, so we just came back from our holidays. The tips given here were really helpful.  However, we found out our child was afraid of the dark : since it was a night flight, they dim the lights during take-off. Unfortunately, we found that out when they put the lights back on, when we reached the cruising altitude. Apart from that, all went fine.</p>

35015	Does any airline in the world allow air travel without government identification?	<p>It seems that pretty much every airline requires at least one form of government identification for flights, even if it's a local flight within a single country.</p>  <p>Does any airline in the world form an exception to that rule? I was recently surprised to learn that <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5224/are-there-any-airlines-that-still-allow-smoking-on-board-flights">some airlines</a> still allow smoking on-board, so I'm sure there are also exceptions to the documents policy.</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
13823	Can I obtain more than one working holiday visa?	<p>I'm sure this has been discussed before but: I'm in the midst of planning a trip to Europe. I'm an Australian citizen, born and bred, and I'm only 22. I'm organising a working holiday scheme (WHS) visa for the Netherlands as I have a friend there who can line me up with work if I want it. The terms of the visa let me travel around as much as I like in the Schengen area for up to 1 year, but only work in the Netherlands, as it is organised through the Dutch consulate specifically. Just so we're clear, this is different to a Schengen Travel Visa, which allows free movement for 90 days in a six month period in the Schengen area. I want to stay in Europe for more than 1 year though.</p>  <p>So my question is: Can I organise another year-long working holiday visa in another country within that Schengen area (I'm thinking Germany) towards the end of my Netherlands visa to allow me to travel around for another year? If not, can I organise a visa for the UK easily at that time, and does the UK visa allow travel into the schengen area so I could go back and catch anything I missed in the first year?</p>  <p>Failing all that, is there any other way I can stay in Europe for more than 1 year without having to commit to studying or working the whole time, as I spent the last three years in Australia working 7 days a week to save enough money that I can blow it all just travelling around and seeing as much of Europe's beauty as possible?</p> 
40547	What would happen if you miss the bag drop-off deadline and it's kind of the airline's fault for bad ground service?	<p>I turned up at the airport today in what I would consider moderate but not great (since the train was late) time: </p>  <ul> <li>35 minutes before bag drop-off closed.</li> <li>75 minutes before departure.</li> </ul>  <p>To cut a long story short, there was an incredibly long line and only 3 counters open. I was able to squeeze in the priority line and had 3 minutes to spare before the 'bag drop-off deadline'.</p>  <p><strong>There were people behind me who would have been past the deadline. I'm curious what would have happened to them?</strong></p>  <ul> <li>I've heard about boarding being denied for turning up 1 minute late.</li> <li>Then again, it's partially the ground staff's fault for being inadequately staffed.</li> </ul>  <p>What would have been the likely fate of these passengers?</p>

27302	Can you freeze liquids to pass security checks?	<p>Once I read a suggestion saying that frozen "liquids" are not subject to the 100 ml restriction of security checks in airports. I've found <a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/2009/11/response-to-tsa-takes-big-gulp-over.html">other</a> <a href="http://boardingarea.com/flyingwithfish/2011/12/27/freeze-your-drink-fly-through-airport-security-with-it/">references</a> of this googling, but they all refer to TSA (I assume only hold in the US).</p>  <p>Is it true then that it's possible to carry frozen fluids in your hand luggage, in larger quantities than 100 ml?</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p>

I'll be traveling with carry-on luggage only, so on the return, it's obviously no problem. But would I be allowed through security and on to the plane in PHL with out having flown from Allentown? </p>

5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
44211	Is it true that people "can just take all the luggage off the airport conveyer belt and leave with it."?	<p>"They don't check that it's yours at the door"? According to the mouse-over text for this XKCD comic strip:</p>  <p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1494/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/insurance.png" title="LIFEHACKS: You can just take all the luggage off the airport conveyer belt and leave with it. They don't check that it's yours at the door!" /></a></p>  <p>That's scary. I wonder what are the chances of getting your luggage stolen (from the conveyor belt, not lost by the airways company).</p> 
22604	Will my checked luggage freeze in the airplane?	<p>I'm taking some freeze-sensitive items in a checked luggage for a short flight. It's <strong>cheese, chocolate, toothpaste and wine</strong>. I would like to know whether the luggage can get "frozen" in the aircraft. Sometimes it happened to me that my stuff actually was quite cold after the flight, so I'd like to be quite sure. Especially the cheese was really expensive and freezing it would very likely demage it.</p>  <p>Usually I pack everything well in clothes, but this time the things are just too many so it's tough to do more than just protect the wine from breaking.</p>  <p>Some details: It's an A320 flight taking 1.5 hours, with Czech Airlines, from Paris CDG to Prague PRG.</p> 
39113	What is the average & max temperature of an airplane cargo hold?	<p>I want to take some chocolates to offer in my luggage. Chocolates are a bit sensitive to heat, though. What is the average temperature inside a cargo hold? 'Average by' itself can be misleading. What is the max temperature there?</p>  <p>I don't know much about airplane mechanics but I assume they have some cooling systems like any other engine. Such systems, depending on where they are placed, might influence temperature in the cargo hold. I also fear temperatures in the ground while exterior temperatures are higher, and luggage is being put inside. What are max temperatures near the airplane in such situation?</p> 
35015	Does any airline in the world allow air travel without government identification?	<p>It seems that pretty much every airline requires at least one form of government identification for flights, even if it's a local flight within a single country.</p>  <p>Does any airline in the world form an exception to that rule? I was recently surprised to learn that <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5224/are-there-any-airlines-that-still-allow-smoking-on-board-flights">some airlines</a> still allow smoking on-board, so I'm sure there are also exceptions to the documents policy.</p> 
10990	How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?	<p>I am planning to travel to India (<code>COK</code> airport, Kerala) from United States. I want to take my laptop as well as my tablet (iPad). Am I allowed to take both in my backpack with my documents related my work. I think I am allowed to take only one computer as per the rule. Will the customs consider my iPad as a computer?  What all I can take? </p>  <p>One of my friends took 2 laptops (1 work and 1 personal) and had trouble at the airport.</p>  <p>Also I am planning to take some wristwatches (7 of them, each avg price is 45 $). I read in a website that I can take stuff up to max 35000 <code>INR</code>. Is that true? In that case, how will I manage my stuff?</p> 
4984	Historical flight data	<p>Where can I find historical data on flights, specifically Delta international flights?</p>  <p>I need to find out about cancellations, diversions and any other flight data pertaining to a particular route over a period of time.  This source has to be official and stand up to legal scrutiny.</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
758	Can I rent a camper in the US/Canada with a European B license?	<p>We are considering a holiday in North America with a camper. I have a European driver's license (B) which allows me to drive personal cars up to 3500 kg, although I can imagine that an average camper easily weighs more.</p>  <p>Does my license qualify me to drive a camper? If not, can I take an American/Canadian driver's test which would allow me to drive a camper?</p> 
13464	What harm can be done with a copy of one's passport?	<p>In one of the questions on this site, it was suggested the use of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/6602/141">Dropbox</a> to save a backup copy of your passport, in case you need to proof who you are if your original document is lost. </p>  <p>I like the idea, but what if someone gets access to your Dropbox folders and is able to acquire the copy of your passport.  The same goes for when you leave a copy of your passport at a hotel receptions desk. Once someone has the info printed on that copy, would that make it easier to steal your identity?</p> 
44317	Can an airline really refuse to depart when overbooked?	<p>I do not fly often, but when traveling home from vacation with my family yesterday, I encountered something I have never seen and I am wondering if what the flight attendants were saying was true.</p>  <p>Originally, our aircraft was supposed to be an Airbus A321 but was downsized to an A319 (based on <a href="http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/US_Airways/US_Airways_Airbus_A321.php">SeatGuru</a> is about a 33% decrease in capacity). Since the flight was mostly full originally, this resulted in a significant overbooking. Of course they asked for volunteers to change flights (with some incentives). But while they were doing this they began the boarding process. </p>  <p>Once everyone was on board and seated (to be clear everyone on the plane had a seat but there were people still at the gate who apparently "needed" to be on the flight), the flight attendant announced that they still needed 3 more volunteers or the plane wasn't leaving. Eventually 3 more people volunteered the remaining passengers boarded and we got underway about 15 minutes late. Turns out the 3 people that needed to board were crew (not working on the flight), presumably trying to get to my destination airport to work.</p>  <p>But my question is what if no one volunteered? Would the airline be allowed to hold the aircraft at the gate indefinitely or refuse to leave unless someone gave up their seat? Everyone was on the plane and ready to go, so bumping someone against their will would have required physically removing them from the plane.</p> 
16427	How can you take advantage of an airline needing to bump people?	<p>Relating to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/16331/what-can-we-do-about-airlines-overbooking">this question about overbooking</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/16426/what-steps-can-you-take-to-avoid-being-bumped-from-a-flight">this one on being bumped</a>, we know that sometimes an airline needs to bump people from the flight.</p>  <p>In many cases when that happens, there's compensation on offer, or perhaps upgrades on later flights. If you're in a hurry, that's not of much interest. However, if you're not in a rush, you might actually find yourself better off by being one of the people not to make that flight.</p>  <p>How does it tend to work if you do <em>want</em> to be the person getting bumped? Is the amount on offer often negotiable? Does it change if you hang on longer? Does frequent flier status change things? And are you best off asking at checkin, or at the gate?</p> 
30959	With Air France "TGVAir", can you check in the night before?	<p>I've booked a combined train + flight ticket with Air France, which involves taking a TGV to Paris CDG airport, then an onward flight. The TGV leaves very early in the morning.</p>  <p>I've been looking at the <a href="http://www.airfrance.us/US/en/common/resainfovol/avion_train/reservation_avion_train_tgvair_airfrance.htm" rel="nofollow">Air France page on TGVAir</a>, and that says</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If you are traveling by train to the TGV station at Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport ... Collect your ticket at the tgvair counter in an SNCF train station</p>      <p>To collect your ticket, present your trip summary or a form of identification.</p>      <p>Your Check-In Deadline is set at 15 minutes before your train´s departure time.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Since the TGV leaves very early, I'd rather not have to get there at least 15 minutes before to check in. I'd much rather have the extra time in bed! I'm also not completely sure that the ticket office will be open that early, and if it is I doubt there'll be many people there, so there's always the risk of a wait if there's someone there first...</p>  <p>Given that I'm travelling through the departure station the night before anyway, is it possible for me to check in then, and return to the station in the morning armed with my tickets. Is that possible? </p>  <p>(In case it matters, the TGV leaves at 5.57am, and I'd be looking to check in at something like 6.30pm (18:30) the night before, so less than 12 hours before)</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
30679	Use of unused Schengen visa to travel to Switzerland	<p>I am Indian national residing in UK and have been issued Schengen visa by Norway Embassy which is Type 'C', multiple entry and expires on 21st oct 2014.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have never used this visa to travel to any country in Europe.</p>  <p>My question is whether I use this Schengen visa issued by Norwegian Embassy to travel to Switzerland for a 10 day holiday?</p>  <p>My first port of entry will be Geneva airport.</p>  <p>Please let me know if I can use this visa and if I need to carry some additional documents to clear immigration control when I land in Switzerland.</p> 
2181	What supporting evidence is required for a Moroccan travel visa?	<p>I plan to travel to Morocco later this year and wanted to check if anyone with previous experience getting a travel visa can shed some light here. <a href="http://www.moroccanembassylondon.org.uk/en/viisa.html">The Embassy of Morocco in the UK</a> states that for a travel visa, the following documents are required (among others):</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Copy of your detailed <strong>provisional</strong> flight itinerary.</li>   <li>Hotel <strong>provisional</strong>    reservation or notarized Letter of Invitation   from your sponsor in    Morocco.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>However, <a href="http://www.visaguru.co.uk/182/223/India/Morocco/visa-requirements.htm">Visa Guru</a>...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Copy or Original hotel confirmation (Hotel confirmation must show   <strong>paid in full</strong>.)</p> </blockquote>  <p>...and <a href="http://morocco.visahq.co.uk/requirements/India/resident-United_Kingdom/">Visa HQ</a>...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Copy of <strong>confirmed</strong> hotel reservations <strong>issued directly from the hotel</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>...seem to imply stricter restrictions on what is an acceptable form of accommodation proof. So my questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Is a booking done through a third-party site (Hostelworld, Expedia, the lot) acceptable?</li> <li>Does the accommodation booking <em>have</em> to be paid for in full? (Because with some booking websites, only a deposit is taken.)</li> <li>Is a hostel booking (rather than a hotel booking) - either paid partly or in full - even considered as a valid supporting document for a Moroccan travel visa?</li> </ol> 
3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
26620	Why do public toilets in the US have large gaps (no privacy)?	<p>Most public toilets in the US are very low in privacy, the bottom gap in the door is so big something around 15-20% of the door, the side gaps are too big as well. This will make the toilet experience so unpleasant with no privacy at all. You can literally count the people outside and people outside are like "ok, now he is wiping, etc.".</p>  <p><strong>I can't think of a reason behind this. Can someone tell me why?</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPSDo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
9938	How do I get from Brussels airport to Ghent when trains are on strike?	<p>I am landing in Brussels later today at 17.35 and was planning to continue by train to Ghent. I just learned that the trains are on strike so this option has disappeared. The strike ends at 22 so maybe it is possible to catch a train then. Are there any options better than waiting? Also - may it be smart to get a bus into Brussels and wait for the trains there?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p>

Youtube doesn't have a tutorial on this either. Any other suggestions please</p> 
25470	How can I wash myself Indian-style (using water not toilet paper) in Western toilets?	<p>As an Indian I have grown up in Delhi using water to wash after using the toilet instead of toilet paper. In Indian culture this is considered a cleaner practice because of the use of water in order to wash the privates instead of toilet paper which may leave a residue.</p>  <p>Although I was able to comfortably adjust with the toilet paper system, many Indian people find it quite difficult and "dirty".</p>  <p>Are there any tips for a traveler to appropriately conduct themselves while fulfilling their wish of using water instead of toilet paper. I have heard of several people carrying PET bottles to the washroom in Western countries due to lack to tap and jug or hand shower, but I feel this is even worse and inappropriate as well.</p>

2331	Cutting pain under eyebrow on plane landing	<p>Since last couple of years I've started experiencing pretty severe cutting pains in the left eyebrow region on plane landing. The strange thing is that it doesn't happen every time. I think it's like 50/50. One time it hurts like hell and the other time it's nothing at all.</p>  <p>A week ago I had it very bad on my way to a vacation. It hurt for 2 days after we landed. And on the way back it didn't hurt at all.</p>  <p>So I guess there must be some factors that affect this and some ways to prevent or at least minimize the probability and severity of the pain. I've heard that this could be related to stuffed nose. So, even though I had no noticeable cold, I tried to blow my nose when the plane started descending on the way back and that might be what helped. But it's hard to tell for sure since, as mentioned above, it didn't happen on every landing anyway. Maybe it just depends on the landing "style" (speed, etc.) and there's nothing I can do about it.</p>  <p>Any advice?</p>

When we booked we had no idea how complicated the US immigration system is for some nationalities and as a result, we've a few questions... but first here is our brief story:</p>  <ul> <li>We live and work in London and are taking a 21 day holiday to visit family.</li> <li>I am a British citizen, my husband is Brazilian citizen.</li> <li>On the way to Brazil we will change flights at Washington Dulles International (in the airport for only 2.5 hours).</li> <li>On the way back from Brazil we will change flights at Newark (in the airport for 3 hours).</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Here are my questions:</strong></p>  <ol> <li><p>We understand that my husband needs a C1-transit visa for transiting in the US. Is this right even though we're only on US soil for 3 hours each time?</p></li> <li><p>I've been told that we need one C1-transit visa that will cover both entries and exits (Washington on the way, Newark on the way back).  Is this true?</p></li> <li><p>If we do just make 1 visa application to cover both trips, how do we show in the application form that we will have two very short visits (2-3 hour layover)?  EG, There is only 1 place to enter an entry date and only one place to enter an exit date.  How do we show that we are entering and leaving twice?  </p></li> </ol> 
6476	What's the best time to get "last-minute" discount hotel prices?	<p>Some online travel sites (I'm thinking of Hotwire specifically, but the question applies more generally) offer low rates on high-quality hotels if you're willing to not specify exactly where you want to stay. As I understand it, these rates are possible because the hotels would rather have a room occupied than not, even if they're making a minimal profit off it. So I would think, if you're using one of these sites like Hotwire, the cheapest hotel rate they can offer should get <em>lower</em> as you get closer to the date of travel. Is that actually the case?</p>  <p>In my case specifically, I will be attending an event in Boston in about a month. The lowest hotel prices I'm seeing close to the location of the event are around $200-250 right now, but I'm wondering whether those are likely to get any lower in the few days prior to the event itself. (I'm aware that there are other ways to find accommodation on a budget, but I'm just researching my options for now.)</p> 
13221	Website to identify low season for hotels	<p>I use online booking websites (Agoda, Booking.com, ...) to check hotels prices; But they are good when you know the time of travel.</p>  <p>I want to plan my vacation and it can be any time. So, I started to search for "when is the low rates season for hotels?".</p>  <p>Is there a website which provides this? </p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: When I search on booking.com for a certain hotel, I get different prices on different days in the year.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I am looking for worldwide website (even if it is collection of booking.com's prices). But I am interested in middle east hotels.</p> 
13744	How can I find the cheapest private hotel room (as opposed to a bed in a dorm) using online tools?	<p>I tried the standard tools like <a href="http://www.kayak.co.uk/hotels">Kayak</a> or <a href="http://hotels.momondo.co.uk">Momondo</a>, but there the cheapest option is always a bed in a dormitory. In particular I was searching for Amsterdam and the first few pages of results (sorted by price ascending) were full of dorms, making the tools useless in practice. How can I efficiently filter on the fact that I want a private room (for whatever number of people I enter)?</p> 
40217	How can I discover what time of the year hotels will be cheapest for a given city, e.g. Tokyo?	<p>I'm interested in visiting Tokyo in 2015, and am trying to figure out what time(s) of the year will likely be cheapest for hotel stays, since it is a notoriously expensive city. Short of using a hotel search such as <a href="http://www.hotels.com/">hotels.com</a>, and laboriously going through each week/month of the year, is there a quicker way? Assume I want to constrain it to hotels of at least a reasonable luxury level (3*+). I'd like to base this on actual costs from a search engine as if I were to book now, not simply past observations from a guidebook (which typically only take in account the time for the booking, but <em>not</em> the time at which the booking is made - for example, <strong>staying</strong> in January may be generally cheap, but if I <strong>book</strong> now, in December, it probably won't be).</p>  <p>More generally, is there a way to search in this way for any city/area worldwide?</p>  <p><em>Note</em>: Yes, I know that airline tickets will vary in cost too - I'm spending airmiles, so assume for the purposes of this question that this and other costs stay constant.</p> 
36814	Hidden city ticketing	<p>At this link about <a href="http://thepointsguy.com/2014/09/8-travel-hacks-to-save-time-and-money/" rel="nofollow">travel hacks</a></p>  <p>what does the author mean by this?</p>  <ol start="8"> <li>Back to back and hidden city ticketing. Sometimes airlines will charge far more for tickets to that do not include a Saturday night stay, on the assumption that those passengers are business travelers who aren’t flexible and can afford to pay more. Yet those who commute between cities eventually realize that they can purchase one round-trip ticket that covers their first outbound and last return, followed by round-trip tickets to return home on the weekends.</li> </ol> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p>

42820	UK PLAB Visa Refusal	<p>I had applied for a PLAB (Doctors) Visa for the UK to appear in PLAB test. I got refused on the basis of two recent large deposits in the bank statement I provided (my mothers). In reality, these are my own savings which I had deposited in her account to make it more strong. The only objection I got was that I must provide evidence for the source of these deposits. Other than this, I have previously travelled to the UK and USA as well as other parts of the world and my travel history is fine. Can someone please advise on how to proceed and re-apply?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

39215	Non-owner car liability insurance companies in the US	<p>I am going to rent a car for four days in the US (Colorado) and I need liability insurance. I am European and I don't own any car, so I don't have any liability insurance. My credit card covers CDW and LDW.</p>  <p>I can hire the liability insurance at the counter of the rental company, but I guess it is not cheap.

35813	LDW / LIS for US car rental booked in UK	<p>If I book a rental car for a week in the US through the US website I can pay about $300 which becomes more like $550 if I take Loss Damage Waiver and Liability Insurance. But if I book from the UK website, I still pay the equivalent of about $300 but LDW and LIS are included in the price.</p>  <p>What gives? The hire-companies are apparently obliged to include LDW and LIS but why aren't they charging the same for it as they charge their US customers? Is it that much of a rip-off? Do few US customers take it because they have their own insurance? More importantly, is there a catch?</p> 
7236	What's with Canada's airport codes?	<p>In my flying experience (passenger), I've gotten used to seeing 3 letter airport codes.  AKL = Auckland. LHR = London Heathrow.  LGW = London Gatwick. LAX = Los Angeles.  <em>Generally</em>, they seem to make sense - some sort of logic flow is applied to the name.</p>  <p>Which brings me to Canada.  What bemuses me is when I see Canadian airports - they (so far) all seem to start with Y.  YVR = Vancouver. YYZ = Toronto.  YEG = Edmonton.  And so on.  VR is sort of an abbreviation for Vancouver, I guess, and Edmonton at least <em>starts</em> with an E, but I can't explain the Toronto one.  And where the Y comes from I have no idea.  Can anyone explain why they start with a Y, historically?</p> 
27485	Can I use Google Maps traffic information to estimate driving time for a specific date/time?	<p>In supported regions, Google Maps will tell me how long it will take to drive from A to B in current traffic conditions.  It can also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/25817/will-the-traffic-and-parking-be-easier-in-york-on-a-week-day-or-a-weekend/">colour-code roads according to traffic conditions for a specific date and time of the week</a>.  However, is it possible to estimate driving time for a specific date and time of the week?</p>  <p>(For a (long) weekend trip, I'm estimating whether it's worth to take the train from Toronto to Barrie and rent a car from there, as opposed to renting a car from Toronto)</p> 
44578	How is the range of Google Maps new drive time feature defined?	<p>I just noticed Google Maps new feature.  It allows the user to get approximate drive times for a specific date and time using average traffic conditions.  This is a feature which <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/27485/can-i-use-google-maps-traffic-information-to-estimate-driving-time-for-a-specifi">many people have been wanting for quite some time</a>.  It allows the user to choose to depart at a specific time or arrive at a specific time.  In the later case it recommends a time for the user to leave.  The drive time is given as a possible range of times (see the screencap below).  </p>  <p>My question is; how is this range of times defined?  Is it the minimum to maximum range, the 90% confidence interval, or perhaps the 25th to 75th percentile?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QpIuW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
38718	From Italy to Austria during winter, by car	<p>In the first week of January, my family are going to travel from Milan (Italy) to Innsbruck (Austria), then to Munich (Germany) and finally back to Milan (maybe via Switzerland). All the hotels are already booked. My original plan was to rent a car to travel between these cities, but just now I found out that: in order to drive in Austria during the winter, the car should use winter tires. Italy rental car companies, doesn't offer this option, so, I can't rent a car that has winter tires and consequently I can't travel to Austria by car.</p>  <p>I know I have the option to travel by train, but sincerely, my first option is by car. So, does anyone know how can I handle this situation?</p>  <p>Also, I'm aware that, in order to drive in Switzerland, the car must have the "vignette". Does have any option to drive via Switzerland with a rental car and not to pay the full price for the "vignette"?</p>

42124	How to remove airlines/security tag stickers from suitcases?	<p>I travel a lot, for both business and pleasure. One of the annoying things I face (beside full passport pages) is the many tags stuck to my suitcase which I like to take in almost all my trips. I recently had to give up my favorite 12 years old Samsonite hard-shell suitcase because it was too ugly and I could not remove the tags easily. </p>  <p>This is a photo of one of my other suitcases which is not really old and does not have many stickers:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sfqHtl.jpg" alt="suitcase with numerous old tags"></p>  <p>I know that the best way to get rid of those is to remove them while they are fresh (eg. right after arrival) when the glue still not really dry, but I just keep forgetting and by the time I notice that tags are really stuck and won't be removed.</p>  <p><strong>How do I remove old tag stickers from hard-shell suitcases completely?</strong></p>

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

During this time I want to spend a day leisurely cycling (nothing too intense) to see some countryside sights outside of Amsterdam. I heard that the island of Marken is suitable for such a thing. Not too far, flat and plenty of safe cycle routes. I also realise that it will be getting dark around 16:30 and the weather may be cold.</p>  <p>My questions are: </p>  <ul> <li>What are peoples experiences of hiring bikes in Amsterdam?</li> <li>What times can you hire from and return the bike?</li> <li>Are there any deposits that have to be paid? Credit card or cash?</li> </ul>  <p>EDIT: Slimmed down my questions.</p>

1493	Travelling with beach sand in carry-on	<p>I'm making a trip back home (to the coast) shortly, and I would like to bring back sand from the beach with me as a keepsake or memento. It's just a short weekend trip, and I won't be checking any luggage, so I was wondering if it's even worth bothering trying to bring sand aboard the plane in my carry-on?</p>  <p>If so, what can I do to make the security screening as smooth as possible? I was planning on putting the sand in sandwich-sized plastic bags, enclosed in a larger quart- or gallon-sized bag.</p> 
9499	Birth while traveling on-board an airplane	<p>Yesterday, a friend of mine who works as a purser (chief flight attendant) helped a lady with delivering her baby during a flight to Manila, Philippines while over the ocean :)</p>  <p>I know that pregnant ladies after their 7th month (in this particular airlines) are not allowed to travel by air but she somehow managed to be on-board (it is her responsibility to declare that). Anyway the baby was delivered in a professional way as if he was delivered in a hospital and he is fine and healthy :)</p>  <p><strong>My question: What will be the place of birth for the baby? The origin country or destination country of the flight? Or somewhere else?

1167	Paris on a Tuesday - are the Louvre and the Pompidou Centre the only "big" attractions that are closed?	<p>One that's caught me out before is that the Louvre is <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/llv/pratique/horaires.jsp?bmLocale=en" rel="nofollow">closed on Tuesdays</a>. It looks like the Centre Pompidou is also <a href="http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Communication.nsf/0/4FEAC046A4F24A42C1257570003D87FE?OpenDocument&amp;L=1" rel="nofollow">closed Tuesdays</a> (French - Tuesday=Mardi).</p>  <p>However, the Paris Modern Art Museum (Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris) is <a href="http://mam.paris.fr/" rel="nofollow">closed Mondays</a>, and the Eiffel Tower is open <a href="http://www.eiffel-tower.com/preparing-your-visit/opening-times" rel="nofollow">every day</a>, so it's not a universal thing.</p>  <p>Without wishing to build a list of the closing days of all of Paris's attractions, are there any other "big name" attractions that are also closed on a Tuesday, or are those the only two big ones to catch the unwary visitor out?</p>

Visiting these onsen is supposed to be a popular vacation destination for the work-weary Japanese.  </p>  <p>I've been told that, as with other things in Japan, there is a rather strict etiquette surrounding the use of the onsen.  In particular, the two things I've read about so far are</p>  <ul> <li>Swimming Suits are not allowed.</li> <li>It is very important that one bathe immediately before entering the onsen.</li> </ul>  <p>Are these true?  Are there any other taboos that a naive American should be aware of?  </p>

But it's not a travel agent, it's only a search engine.</p>  <p>So this site gives you the full and precise details of the flight that you must quote to a travel agent and in theory the agent should be able to book you a ticket on that specific flight and get very close to the price the site quoted.</p>  <p>I am assuming there are other ways besides this flight search engine to find specific flight details where you can't necessarily buy the tickets, so my question is:</p>  <p><strong>When I have details of a specific flight I want to book at a quoted price, but I don't have access to a physical travel agency, is there somewhere I can book that flight online?</strong> (Especially when I'm in a strange foreign country on the other side of the world?)</p>

34318	Getting Schengen visa from a European country without stepping foot into it?	<p>I have an upcoming travel for a conference in country A. But their consulate is pretty busy and I would like to get my visa sooner.</p>  <p>Can I go to the consulate of a different country B which doesn't need appointment for visa applications and get my visa from there? I can schedule to be in A for 5 days and in B for 7 days.</p>  <p>What if I change my plans later not to visit country B at all and go a country C or just stay in A the whole time? Will there be issues when entering or exiting Schengen states?  </p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I called consulate of country B and talked with the visa officer. He told me since you are visiting country A for a conference that is your main destination even though you spend more time in A. He said the rules say: 1. main destination 2. if no, longest stay 3. if no, entrance. He told me that he is reluctant to issue me a visa and asked me to contact country A's consulate, if they don't take the application he will review it.</p>  <p>I called consulate of country A. First the operator told me to go to B then after telling her that I am going to A for business (conference), she told me that I should apply at theirs (A).</p>  <p>Looks like the key thing here is the conference not where I spend most of my time.</p>

37336	My visa period start on arrival, would they let me get into the plane?	<p>I have a question, I applied for the Schengen visa through Germany, on the form they ask me when I'd arriving (to Germany) and when I'd returning. they take this exact date as the visa period.</p>  <p>I wondering if they would let me get into the plane, even though my flight it a day before the arrival.</p>  <p>Let get the real deal; let say this:</p>  <p>My visa is valid from 02/12/2014 to 02/02/2015. But, my flight is scheduled to be departing on 01/12/2014, but entering Germany 02/12/2014. the flight duration is almost 9hours and there is 7hours difference between Germany and the departing flight country.</p> 
34616	Non-resident alien working for non-US company telecommuting for 10 days under ESTA Visa Waiver	<p>I am a European citizen non-US resident travelling to the US for 4 weeks under the ESTA Visa Waiver, of which 10 days will be spent telecommuting/work remotely. I know that I am legally within my rights to do so, based on the ESTA Visa Waiver Help section. And based on these sources: <a href="http://www.ilw.com/articles/2012,0625-Paparelli.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilw.com/articles/2012,0625-Paparelli.shtm</a> &amp; <a href="http://taxmap.ntis.gov/taxmap/pubs/p519-010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://taxmap.ntis.gov/taxmap/pubs/p519-010.htm</a>, I will also not be taxable for that time because:</p>  <ul> <li>My salary for those 10 days will be less than $3000.</li> <li>My total time spent in the US this year will be less than 90 days.</li> <li>My employer is a non-US company.</li> </ul>  <p>(And just to be clear: I have no intentions of moving to the US permanently.

4105	How early should you get to the airport in the US?	<p>When traveling on a domestic flight in the US, how early is it recommended to get to the airport before the flight is scheduled to leave? What about international flights leaving from the US? Are there general rules for times of day or days of the week when airports tend to be busier and it would be wise to arrive earlier?</p> 
44258	Can I change my route and hotel reservation after getting a Schengen visa?	<p>My route trip is Prague-->Berlin-->Vienna.

12771	I want to travel to the USA while working remotely for my non-US employer	<p>I would like to travel in the USA for a period of 3 - 6 months. But I want to spend some time working for my employer (remote work) and getting paid by the employer. Is this possible under a tourist visa (B1/B2)?</p>  <p>I hope this is OK since I will not be getting paid by a US employer. I am in the IT trade so all that I will be needing is my own laptop and a connection to the internet. The money I earn would actually help me pay for the expenses I get during the holiday.</p>

45114	Overstayed a visa in US, is it relevant to mention in a Schengen visa request?	<p>One of my friends plans to visit Switzerland. He had overstayed a performing artists visa in US for a period of five years. While he went to the U.S. he had a permanent job in India. Now he is back in India and has been working in the same Engineering college for three years. When he applies for the Schengen visa should he show all these details, even if it is not known that they will know. Will it lead to rejection? Thank you.</p>

7053	How long before expiration can you renew a US Passport?	<p>My US passport expires in just over a year but I've only got one empty page left in it and I've already had extra pages added once.</p>  <p>I'm going to be in the US for a short while and am considering renewing my passport while I'm there.</p>  <p>Am I able to renew a passport that has more than one year of validity left on it so that I can get a new one with more pages?</p> 
4911	South African tourist visa, multiple entry?	<p>I am traveling to South Africa this year on a U.S. passport, and will be taking a safari that leaves South Africa and goes through Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and then I must return to South Africa to fly out of Johannesburg.</p>  <p>I don't need a visa for a stay under 90 days, but does that allow me to <strong>exit and re-enter the country as long as it is within 90 days</strong>? We will only be there for two months.</p> 
10816	If I renew my passport do I get 10 years from the expiration date or 10 years from the renewal date?	<p>If I renew my passport do I get 10 years from the expiration date or 10 years from the renewal date?  </p>  <p>My passport expires in December 2013 so if I travel now, I would still have more than 6 months before it expires, but if I travel after June 2013 I would have less than 6 months before it expires. </p>  <p>If I renew my passport now and my passport would expire 10 years after the renewal date it would be valid until December 2022. If I waited until April of 2013 I'd get an extra 4 months, and it would be valid until April 2023. </p>  <p>On the other hand, if they gave me 10 years from the expiration date of the current passport, then my renewed passport would be valid until December of 2023, almost a year longer than if they only give me 10 years from the renewal date.</p>  <p>Therefore please advise me if I get 10 years from the expiration date or 10 years from the renewal date. </p> 
40645	Is there a website that summarizes the luggage and check-in requirements for each airplane company?	<p>I don't travel much by plane but I use a wide variety of companies. Since there is not much harmonization, specially with LCC, each one has its own requirements about luggage size, weight, extra luggage price, need for on-line check-in and printed ticket.</p>  <p>Each time I fly I ask my self what are the requirements, and although I can check them online at the official website this can't be quick, sometimes I leave it for last or, with so many, I just confuse airline requirements.</p>  <p>Is there a website or resource that lists this information? This would be very useful to quickly check or just compare requirements.</p> 
34393	Do empty tatkal quota tickets get allotted to wait-listed passengers?	<p>This question is specific about indian railways. I've a train today evening. My ticket status is RAC33 and I don't think 33 cancellation are gonna happen in the next 8 hours. However, 73 tatkal quota seats are still available. Should I cancel my ticket and get another one in tatkal quota (and pay 200 extra)?  I was hoping that they'll fill those empty tatkal quota seats with RAC and waiting list passengers at the time of chat preparation but am not sure. What should I do?</p> 
2310	Which countries, if any, offer on-arrival work visas?	<p>After seeing <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2287/108">this question</a> I began wondering - are there countries that say, Aussies or Kiwis (or anyone else) can get a work visa on arrival, or while in the country?</p>  <p>The best I've found is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html">http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html</a></p>  <p>which indicates availability of working holiday programs, but for several of them (Argentina for example) you are required to apply to Wellington (in my case) before being accepted.</p>  <p>Chile, on the other hand, you can't get one on arrival, but you can apply for one while being a tourist in the country.</p>  <p>So a chart or definitive source of countries where you can basically wander in and start working (legally) would be the ideal answer for this :D</p> 
45165	Will unbooked Premium Tatkal tickets confirm my General Waiting List ticket?	<p>I have a W/L 3 ticket for the Coromandel Express for the day after tomorrow. The ticket is in A/C 3 tier class which also has 18 RAC passengers in this train. So to get a confirmed ticket, I need to have at least 21 cancellations in the next 48 hours. However, I've noticed that the Coromandel Express has 21 tickets under Premium Tatkal quota.  </p>  <p>Everyday, although the Tatkal quota gets filled up, premium quota tickets are not booked because of the high prices. My question is, suppose say 10 Premium Tatkal quota tickets are not booked and the normal Tatkal W/L number stands at say 5. Will these 10 Premium Tatkal tickets be used to confirm the 5 normal Tatkal W/L passengers first (since Premium Tatkal may be looked upon as a subquota of Tatkal if you wish) or will these 10 seats actually upgrade the status of the general W/L (and hence RAC) tickets? </p>  <p>Please note that my question is about the allocation of unused Premium Tatkal tickets and is not a duplicate of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/34393/do-empty-tatkal-quota-tickets-get-allotted-to-wait-listed-passengers">Do empty tatkal quota tickets get allotted to wait-listed passengers?</a>.</p>

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

4191	How can I be sure the operator treats elephants humanely before booking a trek in Khao Sok national park?	<p>The various bungalows in Khao Sok national park advertise elephant treks and there are various tours advertised out of Phuket and Krabi.</p>  <p>These sound interesting.  But how can I tell prior to booking if the elephants are treated humanely?</p>  <p>What it means to treat an elephant humanely is probably a culturally influenced, so I guess I'm talking from a first-world mentality.  I don't have an exact definition. I would dislike it if during the ride they were repeatedly struck in the head with a barbed metal pole.  When not treking I wouldn't like to see them continuously chained up with no ability to move.  Maybe this counts out all elephant treks worldwide?</p>  <p>If these elephants are not treated well I would tend towards to the <a href="http://www.khaosok.com/elephant_ex.php">elephant experience</a> which does not seem to involve a jungle trek but appears more conservation based.</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p> 
43808	Is the UK planning to introduce exit checks in 2015?	<p>Someone from America is a tourist/visitor here who has overstayed their 6 month 'leave to enter'.  In order to avoid getting caught, they are relying upon the fact that the UK does only random, sporadic exit checks on departing passengers.  In the absence of an exit check, there is no exact record of when the person left and so overstaying cannot be detected.</p>  <p>Is this likely to change in the the near future?  Will tourists leaving the UK be uniformly subjected to immigration control to assure (among other things) that they have not overstayed?  If so, when should an overstayer leave by so as not to get caught after activation?</p>

5828	Cheapest trip from Canada to anywhere for visa purposes	<p>I'll be looking to base myself in Vancouver soon.  In the past, you've always had to prove at the border that you'll be leaving again, one way or another.  Last time they didn't take the "I'm planning on winging it" comment well, so fortunately I had a bus ticket to Seattle as well (from Vancouver).</p>  <p>This time I'll have a return airline ticket, so that's easy, but I know other friends who just want the cheapest form of a ticket out of the country.  Last time I had a $22 bus ticket from Vancouver to Seattle.  Is there a cheaper ticket that would serve this purpose? Every dollar counts when you backpack ;)</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong> - it doesn't have to be from Vancouver.  Anywhere in Canada, to anywhere outside of Canada is acceptable.</p>

28925	No more open returns?	<p>Making enquiries about my coming trip I've been told by two different travel agents that there are no longer open return tickets.</p>  <p>This seems unusual to me. I am certain that people I know have had such tickets in recent years.</p>  <p>Does anyone know the truth of this? Do open returns really no longer exist? Why is this so?</p> 
39542	Taking wife on visitor visa while I am on business visa (UK)	<p>I am resident of India and just got UK Business visa ( 6 months, multiple entry) .. I am going for a week on business trip. I want to take my wife along with me and at the end of trip.. I want to extend my trip for 3 days and we want to spend some time on leisure. </p>  <p>What visa I should apply for my wife.. visitor visa? should she mention in the visa form that she is going along with me and staying with me while I am on work and later we are spending time on leisure. </p>  <p>While filling my business visa form, there was a field asking if anyone else is going with me.. I selected no.. as there were no plans.</p>  <p>Also is it ok to spend time on leisure on UK Business visa</p> 
22088	My last name is not the same on ticket as on passport; rest of details are same	<p>I'm traveling from JED Saudi Arabia to Singapore by Saudi airlines. My last name doesn't match the passport. But all other details are same, e.g. passport no., DOB, etc. </p> 
36522	Middle name missing on flight reservation, API needs middle name	<p>We are flying with Monarch, but I booked the ticket through a package holiday company and forgot to give my husband's middle name at the time of the booking (they did not ask for it). We will travel to Tunisia and will have to provide API (Advance Passanger Information) at the check-in desk and as the API requires the full name (first, middle and last name) I am worried that they will notice that my husband's middle name is missing from the flight reservation.  </p>  <p>Is there a rule that flight tickets have to contain middle names as well? I checked Monarch's website and although the middle name is emphasised for the API, it is not specified for ticket bookings; moreover, if you book your ticket online, they only ask for first name and surname.</p>  <p>Do you think this could create a problem? Can he be denied from boarding? (I don't want to call the airline, as I've heard airlines love charging for extras such as a name change so I am not sure if I would be provided with accurate information.)</p> 
13410	Camping along ring road in Iceland	<p>I am planning on a circumnavigation of Iceland this summer and the Ring Road might be the only road available for lenghthy stretches.  I would like to know if camping along the Ring Road is permissable, especially once I get out into the more remote areas. I would also like to know if ground/river water is safe to drink without purifying.</p> 
4729	Driving in Iceland: a good idea?	<p>For this summer I am thinking about going to Iceland. I would like to fly to Reykjavik, spend some days there, then rent a car, travel around the island and then fly back home. Now I have a few questions about that:</p>  <ul> <li>How many days should I spend in Reykjavik if I will stay in Iceland 3 weeks? Is it worth to stay there more than 2 days?</li> <li>How long does it take to travel around the whole island by car? Not super fast, but if I want to stop at the major attractions.</li> <li>Can I reach the major sights with a normal rental car?</li> <li>I heard that the main roads are easily accesible with a normal rental car. But if I want to go into the inner regions of the island, I need an all-terrain vehicle. Can I rent such a vehicle? And is it a good idea to just drive by myself if I don't have any previous experience with such kind of vehicles? For example I never used a car to cross a small river.</li> </ul> 
23760	How accessible are the dirt-road parts of Iceland's ring road?	<p>During my upcoming vacation to Iceland, I am planning to do a complete trip around the Hringvegur. Because the Eastern part of Iceland doesn't have very many landmarks, I am planning to drive from Mývatn to Höfn (a 360 km stretch) in one stretch. I am hoping for this to take around four hours, but considering the fact that there are some dirt roads, I get the feeling I may be underestimating this trip.</p>  <p>Can anybody tell me how many kilometers of dirt roads there are in these parts of the Hringvegur? Is it possible to get through these parts of the country in 4-6 hours? If this takes very much longer than that, I may have to revise my planning a bit.</p> 
10432	Are there companies in China that offer personal tour guide services?	<p>I will be traveling to China by myself and interested in hiring a person to be a personal tour guide for multiple days ...possibly as long as a month. This will be my first trip to China and my grasp of the language is not so great. Are there companies in China that I can contact that offer multi-day tour guides? I will be arriving in Beijing and plan on traveling throughout China for at least 30 days. I'm not interested in pre-planned tours or anything like that. Just need someone who is trustworthy to show me around who can speak the language and keep us out of trouble. </p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>

45511	Where might I observe people sneaking across the Vietnam-Cambodian border illegally?	<p>I'm writing a thriller novel set in modern-day Vietnam. I need my protagonist, who's wanted for murder,  to sneak illegally across the border from Vietnam to Cambodia.</p>  <p>Where are the most porous border areas between these two countries where people are believed to slip across most easily?</p> 
45553	Schengen air travel confirmation and private aircraft	<p>One of the requirements for the Schengen visa is for the applicant to present confirmed travel arrangements, most commonly air travel.  This is usually done by booking a ticket and printing out the confirmation.</p>  <p>On this occasion however, the 'host' owns a Gulfstream G650 and wants to pick up his guest in <a href="http://www.gorodperm.ru/en/">Perm</a> and return with her to Rome.  After a proper visit in Rome, he intends to return to Perm where she will alight.  What should he provide the applicant with in order to meet the Schengen requirement?  Neither host nor guest has done this before so there's no experience to rely upon.</p>  <p>Yes, it's possible to purchase tickets from a commercial airline and then to abandon them once the visa has been issued, and this option has been discussed and summarily discarded as a 'waste of money'. </p>  <p>It's also possible to use Acrobat or Photoshop to mock up a confirmation, but this idea has also been discarded as 'tawdry'.</p>  <p>The host could also send his flight plan that he will file, but this will be in the future and it's indefinite (especially the return trip).  Also, he could send a copy of the registration papers, but this would not indicate anything other than ownership.</p>  <p>She cannot simply write "arrangements have been made" because they would need to see something.  The form says "<em>State who and how and present corresponding  documentation</em>", but nothing more informative is given about the documentation.  What should the applicant enclose with her Schengen application that will demonstrate her capacity to travel when a conventional air confirmation is not appropriate?</p>  <p>The first option is being held in reserve as a last resort.</p> 
26348	Getting a Schengen visa without firm travel plans	<p>My girlfriend and I have South African passports with 5 year ancestral visas for the UK valid until 2018; we've been working here for a few months and have UK bank accounts. We're planning on saving up our earnings to tour around Europe in a few months. We don't know where exactly we'd like to go or for how long - just go where we want when we want.</p>  <p>A Schengen visa would be ideal as it would open a few countries to us. However two Schengen requirements may pose a problem:</p>  <ol> <li>We require tickets in and out of the Schengen zone (not much of a problem since we could get ferry/plane tickets from and to the UK a few weeks apart).</li> <li>We require proof of hotel books or offers of accommodation from whoever we're staying with (this is the big issue as we don't know where we want to go).</li> </ol>  <p>Does anyone know whether not having firm travel plans would absolutely prevent us from being granted visas? Does it make a difference that we are UK residents (we have UK bank accounts and an address we can use but not Right of Residence or citizenship) or that we have leave to return to the UK after our Schengen visa would expire?</p>  <p>Surely you can go to the Schengen zone without knowing where we want to go or exactly where we want to be on a certain date; isn't that the point of a Schengen zone - one visa for all countries?</p>

31126	Travelling from US to India through Frankfurt on H1B visa with approved extension	<p>I am planning to travel from US to India, for which there is a Lufthansa flight that goes through Frankfurt. There I will be switching from one Lufthansa flight (Lufthansa 9053) to another (Lufthansa 758). The layover time in Frankfurt is around 2 hours.</p>  <p>I am an Indian citizen. I am on H1B visa with an <strong>approved extension</strong> (has the new I-90 form). But the visa has <strong>not been stamped</strong> yet in my passport.

12787	Finding flights to Cuba with a flight search engine	<p>Several of the main flight search tools (Kayak, matrix.itasoftware.com) and the like either won't show or tell you they can't show flights to Cuba due to legal reasons and them being American websites.</p>  <p>Is there a search tool that will? I realise I could go to LAN or Copa or other airline's individual websites, but I'd rather there be an easier way to find flights from, say, DFW to HAV (yes I realise it'd most likely have to go  through another country first).</p> 
23852	How to find budget accommodation in Iran?	<p>I usually stay in hostels or guest houses when travelling, it is much easier to meet people than in hotels and usually cheaper too.</p>  <p>Coming up is a trip through Iran and the usual suspects like <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/">hostelworld</a> and <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/">Hostelbookers</a> don't even list that country.</p>  <p>I don't actually think that there are proper hostels in Iran, but there must be some budget accommodation used by travelers where people speak some English.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a> used to be a good source, but even they seem to care less about people travelling on a shoestring these days. </p>  <p>Does anybody has any tips on how to find places to stay?</p>

Are there any tips for this?</p>  <p>I am thinking of taking a cardboard box. It's really light and cheap. It's also disposable at destination if I need to leave it behind. I am not sure one can take a card box and if it's strong enough/consistent to resist an trip (I've seen how luggage is handled).

18862	Is there a cheaper (slower) way to get by train from Brussels to Paris than Thalys?	<p>I'm wondering if there is a cheaper way to get from Brussels to Paris by train than Thalys. Thalys prices are alright if you book some time in advance, but it can be quite expensive if you book only a few days before. I don't mind if the travel time takes some extra hours.</p>  <p>This is related to the question “<a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13731/what-is-the-cheapest-fastest-way-to-get-from-brussels-to-paris">What is the cheapest / fastest way to get from Brussels to Paris?</a>” but no one mentioned other options by train than Thalys there.

30456	Can I use an Emergency Passport as proof of identification within Schengen before travelling back to the UK?	<p>I am a British national living in Spain and my passport is either lost or stolen. I noticed this two days ago when I was intending to take a trip to Salzburg. As it happens, I managed to travel using my UK Driver's Licence. I think a severe mistake was made, as was pointed out to me in Austria, but as they were Schengen Countries, apparently all that is needed is a proof of identity, not a 'travel document'.</p>  <p>My question, therefore, is this. I have business trips over the next three weeks taking me from Spain to Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, and Italy, then back to Germany, and then to the UK. If I obtain an Emergency Passport from the Consulate here in Barcelona, would this be valid as an identity document within Schengen, before I eventually 'cash it in', so to speak, as a travel document when I make my trip from Germany to the UK?</p>  <p>I am hoping so, as I don't fancy my chances of getting back to the UK in time to secure an appointment for a fast-track passport. I am going to call the consulate tomorrow, but would appreciate any advice or prior experience. </p> 
1340	Where is wild camping possible in Europe?	<p>Are there countries in Europe where wild camping with a tent allowed or at least tolerated? How high is the probability that someone will get angry at you or even call the police? </p>  <p>Please consider only cases where the travellers would be using common sense - not making noise, leaving no trace behind, staying out of sight of roads and houses, etc. In our case, the tent is small and easy to hide (dark green) and we won't need a camp fire.</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p>

9070	Do I need a visa to go to Canada from America if I have a Green Card?	<p>I am planning to <em>drive</em> to Niagara Falls to see it from the Canadian side. I have heard good things about seeing it from the other side. So, I want to stay in Toronto for a day, see Niagara Falls and come back.</p>  <p>I have a green card, and, my wife is a citizen from US.</p>  <p>I have read this link, <a href="http://www.niagarafallslive.com/niagara_falls_travel_tips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.niagarafallslive.com/niagara_falls_travel_tips.htm</a>, and this doesn't talk about person with a green card. So, could you advise if I can go to the Canadian side or give me links on this one?  I am on an Indian passport.</p>  <p>EDIT: My experience:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Crossing: We went there at around 7:30 in the morning to avoid the long queue. The border security official asked us to give us our passports, I have given my green card as well with the passport, she asked the purpose of our visit and how many days we were planning to stay. The whole process took around 10 minutes, 7-8 minutes for waiting and 2-3 minutes with the official.</p></li> <li><p>Visit: It is almost an unbelievable sight, you definitely have to see it. Not only that you get to go through the tunnels and see the water flowing in front of you (there is a railing to stop you if you slip, but exercise caution.) As far as I can tell, Canadian side is so much better to view than American side. Also, don't forget to go to the biggest butterfly museum and botanical gardens (1000 acres of it). Also, go on to the top of Skylon tower, I thought it is worth it. Although, our room view for the falls was also very good. Toronto takes more than a day to visit. May be next time, I will have time to see more. Experience the trip yourself, don't go with the travel bookings. </p></li> <li><p>Food: We went to some small villages to experience local food and also went to AG (highly recommended on Trip advisor and me too but you will be spending at least 100 if you are a party of 2). The food was very delicious, makes me want to go again just for food. Enjoy!</p></li> </ul> 
35813	LDW / LIS for US car rental booked in UK	<p>If I book a rental car for a week in the US through the US website I can pay about $300 which becomes more like $550 if I take Loss Damage Waiver and Liability Insurance. But if I book from the UK website, I still pay the equivalent of about $300 but LDW and LIS are included in the price.</p>  <p>What gives? The hire-companies are apparently obliged to include LDW and LIS but why aren't they charging the same for it as they charge their US customers? Is it that much of a rip-off? Do few US customers take it because they have their own insurance? More importantly, is there a catch?</p> 
8619	Travel agents - can they match ITA Travel Matrix prices?	<p><em>(applies to all travel agents, I'm just using FC as an example)</em></p>  <p>Flight Centre - the world wide travel agent, often boasts "lowest prices guaranteed".  I've had trouble getting them to actually hold to this in the past, but generally if you can prove you can get the price elsewhere, like a print out of say, AirNZ's website with a price, they'll match or beat it.</p>  <p>Does anyone know if they'd be willing or able to match <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/">ITA's Matrix site</a>?  It gives prices, but doesn't always indicate WHERE those prices are available.  If you took those prices and flight details along to a travel agent, like Flight Centre, are they able to find the flights for the same price, given all the flight details, assuming the flight is actually still available?</p>

A friend of mine said to go to Laos for a day and then come back, but when I flew into Vietnam for all my visits, I had to pre-arrange a 'visa on arrival' and show papers proving I had this arrangement before I could board an airplane. </p>  <p>I'm worried if I leave the country they won't let me back in, I teach English part time at a school that doesn't give work visas (so they can't help me) and I very much would like to keep teaching. </p> 
26807	Possible to extend a Vietnamese tourist visa in Dong Hoi?	<p>I have an Australian passport with a C1 tourist visa for Vietnam. Is it possible for me to get a standard 30 day (or longer) extension for my visa in Dong Hoi (the major town east of Phong Nha National Park)?</p>  <p>I would prefer answers from people who have actually done this, and as much information as possible including: where it was done, how much it cost, how long the visa extension was for, and how long it took.</p> 
7807	Single vs. Multiple entry Schengen visa, for Spain and France?	<p>I am from Egypt and I'm planning a vacation to <strong>Spain and France</strong>. While filling the visa application, should I choose a single or a multiple entry visa?! If i got a single entry Schengen visa, I still can travel from Spain to France and then back to Spain as long as it is during the valid dates of my visa right?!</p> 
34683	Schengen visa requirements for traveling on a European Disney Cruise?	<p>Do I need a single entry or a multiple entry Schengen if I am travelling on a Disney cruise that starts in Barcelona and then calls on ports in France then Italy?</p> 
25584	Book connecting flight, but only board at second airport?	<p>I'm looking to book flights from) Philadelphia (PHL) to Detroit (DTW). Direct flights are quite expensive. I noticed, in expanding a search to surrounding airports, that I can book from Allentown (ABE) to Detroit for <strong>far</strong> less, and the connection is through Philadelphia.</p>  <p>Can I book this flight but board in Philadelphia? I'll be traveling with carry-on luggage only, so on the return, it's obviously no problem. But would I be allowed through security and on to the plane in PHL with out having flown from Allentown? </p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
45689	What is the cheapest and fastest way of traveling between Liege and Paris with deterministic travelling times?	<p>I am planning to travel from Liege to Paris. The Thalys (train) has this route direct but although they announce very good prices, if bought in advance, I can never find them on the <a href="https://www.thalys.com/be/en/">Thalys website</a>.</p>  <p>Traveling by bus just takes too long. I am not even sure there is a direct connection. At least I couldn't seem to find one.  Using a bus would probably require traveling first to Brussels probably.</p>  <p>Are there any other ways of combining trains to arrive in Paris, as a compromise between the expensive Thalys and the snail bus?</p>  <p>Any other alternatives that might sound interesting are welcome (Eg: how to get the cheapest fare in Thalys or a direct bus connection from Liege).</p> 
31488	Two trips to the USA 3 weeks apart under ESTA scheme	<p>I am a British citizen visiting the USA in early August for a two week vacation with friends. After the holiday I'm returning to my home in the UK for three weeks. After that I will return to the USA and will be working for my British employer under the Visa Waiver Program for a period of 80-85 days.</p>  <p>I have read already that there is technically no problems with this under ESTA rules, but should I limit this working period to a shorter time frame (e.g. 70 or so days) so that it does not negatively affect the decision made by the POE officer? Ideally I would love to be over in the states for the near-full 85 day period.</p>  <p>Any advice or previous experiences anyone can offer?</p>  <p>Some clarifications: As confirmed by the immigration attorney, as I am employed by my UK employer, it will be regarded as a business trip, the important part being that I will be working officially as a consultant for my UK employer just overseas for the allotted 85 or so days</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
45612	How much extra time to allow in Dublin Airport for US pre-clearance?	<p>On an upcoming trip, I'll be flying from Dublin to the USA, on a flight which has US pre-clearance in Dublin.</p>  <p>I'm reasonably happy (based on experiences) about how far in advance I need to get to Dublin airport for a normal international departure, to cover checkin + security + walking + etc. However, I've not taken a pre-clearance flight before.</p>  <p>When factoring in when to get to Dublin airport, for a pre-clearance flight where I'll need to go through US customs and immigration in Dublin, how much extra time do I need to allow for the US pre-clearance formalities?</p> 
27672	Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don't want to stay in Greece at all?	<p>I want to travel to Spain however the requirements state that my UK residence permit be valid for 3 months after intended date of departure from the Schengen area. I'll only have 1 month left when I return. The Greek rules just states I need to have a valid Uk residence permit. Could I apply through the Greek consulate but then use the visa to travel to Spain or do I at least need to touch down in Greece? </p> 
35712	What rights do we have after being 'abandoned' in Guatemala during a technical stop?	<p>We flew Barcelona-Managua return with Iberia this July/August. At Barcelona we were given boarding passes for changes of plane in Madrid and San Salvador. </p>  <p>When we arrived in Guatamala we were told that everyone had to get off the plane with all their belongings and to go through a security check. We double-checked with the cabin crew as we had no scheduled stop there, but were told that we had to all the same. We left the plane and followed the directions of ground staff, showing our boarding passes and asking too (my wife is Spanish, so there were no language issues). We were directed to a waiting area with various shops, cafes and gates. </p>  <p>Despite continuous attempts to get information, we were made to wait until an official told us that our plane had left hours earlier. He told us to leave the secure area and marched us to/through immigration.</p>  <p>Getting on another flight with our ticket also proved difficult to impossible, as we were told we would have to wait a minimum of 48 hours for an available seat, and even that had no guarantee.</p>  <p>Eventually we bought tickets using our own money and flew to Managua, arrived a day late, missed a meeting, without luggage (which took another 3 days to sort out), and with hotel penalties, etc.</p>  <p>Speaking to the staff at the airports and other travellers, we learned that this is not the first problem of this type with Iberia in the area.</p>  <p><strong>What rights do we have and, above all, how can we get the money back for the flights we were forced to purchase?</strong></p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
22109	How to declare value of checked in luggage?	<p>In case of lost baggage, based on what does the airlines calculate value of lost baggage (and reimburse)? The replies to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/89/4584">this question</a> suggest buying insurance, but if one doesn't want to do that is there a way one can declare the value of belongings in checked in baggage ?</p> 
1083	What is the best method of purchasing a ticket with an open return date?	<p>I’ve been doing some research on traveling to South America and staying for an extended period of time (working vacation). The usual sources for flight info (Kayak, Expedia, Hipmunk) don’t have any info on flights with open return dates.  The other option would be to just buy a one-way ticket, then buy a return flight when I want to leave, but I’ve heard that international flights from South America are quite expensive.  What would be the most cost-effective solution?</p> 
45767	Which airlines with routes connecting Vietnam and China have free cancellations and can be booked online?	<p>Due to China's visa rules I need to have a return flight booked in order to obtain a visa. But once I have the visa I am free to enter overland and not use the flight.</p>  <p>On my previous trip I had a travel agent in Vientiane, Laos book such a flight and hotel, print out the details, then cancel them, for a reasonable $3.</p>  <p>This trip in Ho Chi Minh with a much larger tourist zone than Vientiane and many more travel agencies, I can't find one that understands my needs.</p>  <p>So I guess I have to book the flight myself. Having not done this before I'm a bit worried about running into trouble cancelling the flight and spending money for real.</p>  <p>Which airline will allow me to book a flight to China from Vietnam online, then cancel it, with a simple process that I won't mess up, without a fee? (Or a very low fee.)</p> 
36640	Is my ESTA valid for a second trip?	<p>I visited the USA in May this year, on an ESTA which I applied for in April. It was approved and I was allowed entry into the country.  </p>  <p>I'm re-visiting again this November for two weeks. Am I able to use the same ESTA again or do I need to re-apply for a new one? I know it says it's valid for two years, but is that valid for every use within those two years, or I have to use it within two years, and once I have visited on that visa, it's invalid?</p> 
3598	What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?	<p>As we know, most countries require that visitors have a return or onward ticket as a condition of entry.</p>  <p>But often, depending on where you're from and which country you're visiting, you won't be asked to show such ticket.</p>  <p>Now many backpackers like to travel without exact plans made in advance, including buying all one-way tickets when they are finished with one country and have decided where to go next.</p>  <p><strong>But what happens when you're travelling this way and they actually do ask you for proof of return/onward passage?</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Are you sent back on the next plane at your own expense?</li> <li>Will you have some opportunity to buy a ticket at this time?</li> <li>Will this be unlikely to happen in the first place because the airport where you board will tell you whether you'll need a ticket?</li> </ul>  <p>To make it all specific, I'm asking about my friend travelling on an Iranian passport who wants to fly into Malaysia with a one way ticket and travel around Southeast Asia.</p>  <p>Personally I've never been asked to show this proof in an airport but I have at land borders after visa runs and in immigration offices when getting visa extensions. <strong>But</strong> a friend who travels on a British passport was asked for this proof when she flew into Malaysia about two years ago. Lucky for her it was a rare occasion where she actually did have a return ticket.</p>  <p><strong>What will Malaysia do if you are asked to prove onward/return travel but only have a one-way ticket?</strong></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>I can't answer what Malaysia would do if they asked for such proof because when I arrived they did not ask.</p>  <p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, when I was checking in for my flight at the Air Asia X desk in Sydney they did ask me. And they did accept my $10 e-ticket for the train to Singapore as proof.</p> 
28891	Car return / relocation services in the USA?	<p>When people rent cars one-way, the car rental company needs to return the car.  In countries such as Sweden, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, those cars are listed online and people can rent the car very cheaply or for free, provided that they move it from A to B within a specified time and don't make big detours.  Is there any such service in the USA?</p> 
13867	Can I cross the USA-Canada border with a birth certificate and a passport locator number?	<p>My US passport took too long to be shipped to me, and it will arrive after I need to leave. Will I be able to cross the border from the United States to Canada with a birth certificate (copy) and a passport locator number?</p> 
45874	Crossing from to Canada to the USA w/o passport on public transit?	<p>As we know, US citizens can cross into the USA w/o a passport if they can prove citizenship. I am just curious, what if you don't drive? Starting from Toronto, I can see trains both to Windsor and Niagara Falls. From Windsor, you can take the Tunnel Bus across (and curiously enough, it emphasizes only proof of citizenship is necessary). From Niagara Falls, you can walk across the Rainbow Bridge. Once across, you can get to DTW or from Niagara Falls, BUF or IAG.</p>  <p>From Vancouver, based on my own experience, Amtrak, Greyhound, BoltBus, QuickShuttle all wants to see a passport before letting you on. You can't get really close to either of the US border crossings with Translink (it's a mile from 8th Av) and if you do walk over, there isn't a lot of public transit from the other side to BLI or SEA either.</p>  <p>So, what solutions exist if you are in a situation <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13867/can-i-cross-the-usa-canada-border-with-a-birth-certificate-and-a-passport-locato/45873#45873">Can I cross the USA-Canada border with a birth certificate and a passport locator number?</a> like this and you don't drive and want to get from a Canadian airport to a USA airport?</p>

11114	Can I visit Schengen countries on a long term French Visa?	<p>I have requested for a French long term student visa from India. It's a national visa and not a Schengen visa. My question is that can we still go to other Schengen countries on this visa? If not then can we get a Schengen visa from the Indian embassy in France?</p> 
17709	Can we switch terminals at Heathrow (LHR) for shopping only?	<p>We will be flying into and out of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. Now, my wife has taken fancy to a certain duty-free store located at Terminal 3.

Are there air drafts? How cold and how warm can it reasonably get?</p> 
7650	How to transit through Delhi without a visa?	<p>I have read a lot on this subject on the Lonely Planet forum and it looks like the staff on ground can transfer your bags through the Delhi airport if you have a connecting flight without you having to go out to check them in again and therefore needing a visa. I refer of course to the situation when you go with 2 different airlines, because otherwise the luggage is transfered automatically.</p>  <p>I posted a <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7405/how-to-get-from-delhi-to-kathmandu-overland">question about overground travel to Kathmandu</a> and mentioned it briefly there, however I think this subject deserves a separate question and a detailed answer.</p>  <p>Does it depend on the type on an airline? I have read that Jet is no problem, what about AirIndia and IndiGo? And what about the incoming flight to Delhi from Europe or USA, do they all can hand over you luggage to the Indian airlines and pick it up again on the way home? Do you have to contact them before and explain your situation? Or check in your luggage directly to your desired destination?</p>

18575	Getting a US visa with an Iranian stamp?	<p>I am a seafarer (marine engineer) and I have to often visit different countries.

34554	Bank balance for getting a Schengen visa?	<p>I won a contest to visit Belgium and the Netherlands for a week from India. The accommodation and travel is paid by the company.</p>  <p>They have asked for my income tax returns and bank statements along with my passport for the visa application. I have a bank account I regularly use, but I collect my pay in cash, as I work in a non-profit firm. I do use the account regularly, but only when I need to buy something online, for example.</p>  <p>Right now I have a balance of about €2000 in my bank account. Is that sufficient for visa approval? Do they need my paychecks to be reflected in my bank statement?</p> 
44577	Schengen Visa for Germany refused due to lack of subsistence	<p>Hi I am currently living in Chennai (India). I intend to visit Germany as an international exchange student from April - June 2015. I applied for Schengen visa and provided my bank account details as the proof of subsistence. My Bank account had Rs. 150,000 which as per the current exchange rate for euro translates to around 2200 euros. my stay in Germany is gonna be for 89 days. My visa application has been rejected saying the inadequate means of subsistence. So I up my balance amount to 5500 Euros (I came to know for schengen visa to germany one should have 45euros/day). I want to know 1. Procedure for reapplication 2. What all should be submitted as the proof of subsistence 3. No. of days in would take to get the visa under these circumstances. Thanks PS: I would be paying rent (250Euros/month) from my account balance. Also the account balance i mentioned is what i have i booked the return flight tickets.</p>

19687	Have Heathrow immigration queue times stabilized since the Olympics?	<p>Last year, I flew NZ 2 from LAX to LHR twice, once right before the Olympics and once in early December before the Christmas on-rush. The first trip, it took about an hour to clear immigration because of the queues; the second trip, under three minutes. In addition, it seems that the online complaints in regards to Heathrow immigration queue times all date from last year.</p>  <p>As I will be traveling to Heathrow again several times this year, I was wondering if anyone knew if immigration times have stabilized to a semi-predictable length since the Olympics?</p>  <p>I'd be particularly interested in information on Terminal 1, but any information at all would be helpful.</p>

30300	How to book this complex multi carrier roundtrip flight I found on ITA?	<p>I am trying to book a roundtrip ticket from Chicago O'hare (ORD) to Mumbai, India (BOM). Traveling on Aug 9th and returning on Aug 24th. Now, I've been looking for several days (almost 10days!) for ways to book this itinerary I found on ITA. All other websites like Expedia, Kayak, Travelocity, Momondo, RouteHappy, and even google flights are quoting around $1200 roundtrip cost, sometimes as low as $1150. But the ITA Matrix website shows me several options, the lowest is $916 roundtrip. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nAQlD.png" alt="Screenshot for the trip from ORD to BOM"> </p>  <p>You can see there are several flights in the $900 range.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qzks9.png" alt="from BOM to ORD"> </p>  <p>For the return trip there is only one option to get the low price.</p>  <p>Selecting the flights this is what I get:  <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g1pHe.png" alt="Final itinerary"> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8UxDa.png" alt="The codes used to buy this itinerary"> </p>  <p>I'm not sure how to use the fare codes the ITA website provides to purchase this itinerary.</p>  <p>These are some of the things I have tried to book the complex multi-carrier flight from ITA:</p>  <p>My first method was to try coding into HIPMUNK, using the multi-city option, my departure, connections, airlines flights number and dates. Following this method: <a href="http://maphappy.org/2013/10/book-google-ita-matrix-flights-using-hipmunk/">http://maphappy.org/2013/10/book-google-ita-matrix-flights-using-hipmunk/</a></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YG1em.png" alt="coding the segments into HIMPUNK"></p>  <p>And the results page:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I4Xs3.png" alt="results from HIPMUNK"></p>  <p>Here's what my code into HIPMUNK looks like:</p>  <p>ORD::LH9151 FRA LH756 for the first journey and </p>  <p>BOM::LX155 ZRH SN5104 BRU SN8803 for the return trip.</p>  <p>Don't think I'm making any mistakes in coding it, but there are two adjustments I also made which failed:</p>  <ol> <li><p>I used the dates of the first leg of the flight then tried using the other dates as well. So for example Aug 9th and Aug 10th.</p></li> <li><p>I used the codes for the operating carriers and when it didn't work, the marketing carrier leaving the flight number unchanged.</p></li> </ol>  <p>This always returned no results. Breaking up the itinerary to just the oneway from ORD to BOM worked but gave me a price of $624. For some reason the second return trip was creating problems. I tried breaking he return trip down into different segments but no luck. Anyone knows why the return trip is creating difficulties? Coding issues/ hipmunk doesn't have such a large database? </p>  <p>Then I tried method 2: Calling up the airlines</p>  <p>United was able to find all the segments, even price it correctly sometimes (sometimes not) and gave me a confirmation number. I was to call them in 12hrs to check if they were able to procure the seats but when I did call they were not able to get the seats for the SWISS flight from BOM to ZRH and/or from ZRH to BRU. I've tried this at least 5 times changing small things everytime, but the same result. It seems Lufthansa waits for SWISS to confirm the seats but SWISS doesn't respond in time and I'm not able to book.</p>  <p>I tried calling Lufthansa but they were not even able to find the segments and instead told me to look at booking online where I will be able to find it cheaper.</p>  <p>Any insights into the methods that failed or suggestions on how to book this itinerary at the $900 price will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p> 
12870	What does "copy of itinerary" mean when applying for a Schengen visa?	<p>The Italian consulate website says under requirements for a Schengen visa:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Applicants for short term visas (up to 90 days) <strong>must also present an itinerary of their trip</strong>.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>What does this mean? This is separate from the proof of return ticket:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Return-trip booking or proof of available means of personal transport:   ticket reservations for round-trip flights originating in our jurisdiction to Europe (and ultimately to Italy) and back, including internal entry and exit points of travel i.e. EURORAIL tickets, car rental, internal flights. The names of reservations should reflect the name on passport.

46137	It has been recorded that I lied to the Immigration Officer- but I didn't!	<p>One of the reasons for my entry to the UK being refused is because I 'used deception' and concealed the fact that my parents are the in the UK. the truth is, I never lied about this: I told the officer that the purpose of my trip is to visit 'friends and family in the UK and maybe do some volunteering' but he focused on the volunteering part. the thing ism, the voluntary work was never my main plan, it was just a thought i had, and i told him this later but he has written in the statement that ' (I) only revealed the true purpose of the trip, which was to visit friends and family, after further questioning'. and 'used deception to gain entry to the uk by concealing that my parents lived in the uk'</p>  <p>now, i am trying to apply for a visitor's visa ... but i am worried I will be rejected because i supposedly 'used deception'. </p>  <p>i was given two sheets: REASON FOR DETENTION and NOTICE OF REFUSAL TO LEAVE OR TO ENTER on the reason for detention sheet, only two sections were ticked: (B) insufficient information to decide whether to grant you temporary admission... and (6) you have failed to give satisfactory answers... there is a sentence above number 6 about having used deception which has not been ticked.</p>  <p>so my problem is this: do i mention my 'use of deception' in my application for a visitor's visa? there is a section in which i need to write why i was refused...and the reasons i believe are 1) 'deception' 2) no return ticket 3) insufficient funds.</p>  <p>i did not intentionally conceal the fact that my family are living in the uk (i have no reason to!!) but I don't want them to misunderstand. so what should i do? should i write a cover letter? and if i do, what should i write exactly in the cover letter?</p>  <p>thank you so much. i am soso worried.</p> 
46134	how long should I wait before applying for a visa after being refused entry?	<p>I was denied entry to the UK last week (without a visa which was possible BUT was rejected for a few reasons) and was wondering how long I should wait before applying for a visitor's visa? Is there a cooling off period?</p>  <p>thank you</p>  <p>edit: visa rejected because:</p>  <p>-failed to tell them that i have family in the uk -not enough funds -no return ticket</p>  <p>in the main sheet (tick boxes) it states that I have failed to give satisfactory answers to the officer.</p> 
46133	reason for refusal in visa application form?	<p>I have been denied entry to the UK and am now preparing an application form to reapply for a visitor's visa. </p>  <p>There is a section where I need to declare the reason for why i was refused entry to the UK.</p>  <p>I was wondering how detailed this needs to be? there were several reasons for why I was refused - but i'm not quite sure what my main reason was.</p>  <p>what should I write here?? should i just list all the points in the letter that was given to me with the paragraph listing the reasons???</p>  <p>i am so worried because there is a part in the paragraph that states 'you have used deception to enter the uk by concealing that your parents were living in the uk' which is stupid because i told the guy but i think he heard me wrong.  they decided to use the phrase 'used deception' but i don't want the visa application to look bad because of this...so should i just leave this part out? or write a long paragraph explaining?</p>  <p>thank you</p> 
26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
30679	Use of unused Schengen visa to travel to Switzerland	<p>I am Indian national residing in UK and have been issued Schengen visa by Norway Embassy which is Type 'C', multiple entry and expires on 21st oct 2014.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I have never used this visa to travel to any country in Europe.</p>  <p>My question is whether I use this Schengen visa issued by Norwegian Embassy to travel to Switzerland for a 10 day holiday?</p>  <p>My first port of entry will be Geneva airport.</p>  <p>Please let me know if I can use this visa and if I need to carry some additional documents to clear immigration control when I land in Switzerland.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
39446	Attending an academic conference is what type of travel?	<p>I am planning to travel to Portugal to attend an academic conference and in that regard needed a short-stay Schengen visa. The visa application has a field "Purpose of Travel" with the following options:<br></p>  <ul> - Business<br> - Sports<br> - Cultural<br> - Other<br> - Study<br> - Visiting family or friends<br> - Medical reasons<br> - Official visit<br> - Transit<br> - Airport transit<br> - Tourism<br> </ul>  <p>I am attending the conference to present the research I am conducting as a part of my PhD. So "Study" is the closest in my opinion. But I don't want the Embassy to misconstrue that it is for studying at a university in Portugal. In that case, would "Business" be the right option to choose?</p> 
37103	If I don't declare a not-yet-used engagement ring at airport security, am I smuggling jewelry?	<p>In <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/37054/how-do-i-get-an-engagement-ring-past-security-customs-in-an-airport-without-aler">How do I get an engagement ring past security/customs in an airport without alerting my significant other?</a>, MikeV posted a pertinent question which is worth asking:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If I buy a ring in the US, put it in my bag and do not declare the ring I am smuggling jewelry? How is that different from buying the ring, wearing it round my neck on a chain (or on my own finger for that matter) and not declaring it? Am I supposed to declare my own jewelry that I already paid for (including taxes upon purchase)?</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, what is the verdict on this? smuggling or not? And is it a difference whether it's on a finger, on a neck chain, or in a box in the carry-on?</p> 
17969	When travelling internationally with valuable personal effects, how do I avoid paying duty at each border crossing?	<p>Some people travel internationally with valuable personal effects.  The most obvious example is photography equipment which could easily be valued over $15k.  Jewelry, watches, and specialized medical or sports equipment (think expensive bicycle) also seem likely expensive personal effects that people might travel with.</p>  <p>For most countries it seems that personal effects are not subject to duties (see also <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/10934/3067">"Customs and Duties" of this answer</a>).  Of course, this depends on the customs official accepting your claim that the items you are importing are personal effects.  If a customs official rejects your claim that they are, in fact, personal effects, it seems clear that you would have to pay duty on the items.  While this seems uncommon, there are reasonably credible stories about travelers being charge import duties the personal items they are traveling with including <a href="http://photofocus.com/2010/07/29/u-s-based-photographers-traveling-abroad-beware-the-duty/">this one about photographers returning to the USA</a> and <a href="http://photo.net/travel-photography-forum/00XWYm">this one about a visitor to China's iPad</a>.</p>  <p>How do I avoid being charged duty on my valuable personal effects when I cross a border?</p>  <hr>  <p><em>This is probably <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11594/is-there-a-zip-code-i-can-enter-when-paying-at-the-pump-in-the-usa-with-a-foreig">one of those questions that will have a different answer for each country</a>, so I've left it country-agnostic.  <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/17970/3067">I've found the answer</a> for leaving and returning to the USA, but I really need an answer for traveling from Canada to Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, and back to Canada via Germany.</em></p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
31417	Entry and exit from different Schengen countries	<p>I came to Netherlands from Dubai on a business visa.

42529	How much money do I need to show as proof of support when applying for a UK tourist visa?	<p>I am an Indian citizen studying in Italy on an Italian visa that expires 19 November, 2015. I have <em>permesso di soggiorno</em>. I want to visit the United Kingdom for my vacations for a week during March. I know the procedures already, however I am a little bit confused about the amount that I must show as a proof of support with my bank statements. I will stay for a week with my friends who are also students in Italy and will be in London for 5 days. What would be the amount in Euros that I need to show for my visit to UK?</p> 
34243	Pricing and booking mixed-class fares, with economy & premium economy combined?	<p>So I find myself flying mixed-class fares pretty often these days, with the long legs in Premium Economy and the short hauls in plain old Economy.  Some sample trips flown or planned:</p>  <ol> <li>SYD-AKL-SFO (NZ), with SYD-AKL in Economy and AKL-SFO in Prem Econ</li> <li>SYD-SFO-LAS (UA), with SYD-SFO in Economy Plus and SFO-LAS in Economy</li> <li>ZRH-DXB-SYD (EK/QF), with ZRH-DXB in EK Economy and DXB-SYD in QF Prem Eco</li> </ol>  <p>Problem is, none of the booking engines I know handle this.  For example, if I select "Premium Economy" in my usual favorite, <a href="http://matrix.itasoftware.com/">ITA Matrix</a>, it interprets this as "must fly in prem eco <em>or better</em>" and thus doesn't find #1 at all, instead offering $9,000 fares via Hong Kong or something (because there's no Prem Eco for SYD-AKL), and for #2 it quotes me SFO-LAS in First.  None of the airline sites listed above seem to cater to this either, except -- oddly enough -- for award redemptions.  I usually end up getting quotes for plain old economy and asking actual human travel agents how much an upgrade would cost, but this is slow and inconvenient for everybody involved.</p>  <p><strong>So is there a booking engine that lets me specify "fly in premium economy if you can, but economy if not"?</strong></p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
45296	Returning to Schengen Area Visa Questions	<p>I have a question about the 90 Day Rule for going to the Schengen Area (I'm an American). Last June around the 20th I entered Germany as a tourist, and around the 30th of June I got an Au Pair visa that allowed me to stay for 6 months. I left Germany around the 10th of December. I am planning to go to Italy in the first week of June this year (just to travel), and am wondering about this whole 90 day within a 180 day period thing. It will not have been 180 days since I left Germany, but if I had a long term visa while I was there, rather than just a tourist visa, will I be allowed to enter and stay for a full 90 days? Does the 180 day period start from when I first entered Germany, thus I really only used 10 "tourist visa days" before leaving?</p>  <p>I realize this is a super specific question, so if anyone can even just point me in the right direction as to where to find more info on this that would be great!</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
27491	Do I need a transit visa in Frankfurt, Germany on the way to India?	<p>I am travelling from US to India, with an Indian passport but expired F1 visa and going there to get my H1B visa stamping.

4245	Avoiding or minimising altitude sickness?	<p>From my personal anecdotal experience, I've seen first-hand some horror stories with altitude sickness.  I will always tell people now to acclimatise, drink fluids, and follow the local tricks like chewing coca leaves in Bolivia.  However, as far as I'm aware, the only "cure" for it is still to come down to a lower altitude (or pressure chamber).</p>  <p>For the most part, it doesn't matter how fit or healthy you are - it is seemingly random who it affects, and you can be fine one time and terrible the next.</p>  <p>I've been lucky myself to only ever get a little dizzy, out of breath and have headaches, and that's in several trips over 4000m.</p>  <p>What do you use to avoid altitude sickness, or have you seen methods which serve to delay the effects, avoid symptoms or generally get through it OK?</p> 
18168	How strict are luggage restrictions on the Incarail train to Machu Picchu (Aguas Calientes)?	<p>I found on incarail.com website that:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In addition, that large baggage is not permitted on the train   service. We recommend that you take the necessary precautions and   carry equipment baggage not exceeding 8 kg (17.6 pounds), and of the   same dimensions as permitted airline hand luggage.</p> </blockquote>  <p>How strict those rules are? I'm going to board the train with standard carry-on bag and city-backpack. Does anyone knows if its okay?</p> 
46211	Arriving at night before Schengen visa valid date?	<p>I'll be traveling to Germany this May and my planes would arrive at 4 May 20.30 at Frankfurt Airport but the Schengen visa that I received is valid only at 5 May.</p>  <p>Is it possible to enter if it's only a few hours before the day change? Or do I have to wait until day change in the transit area?</p>  <p>Another thing, would the airline rejected me from boarding the plane? </p> 
6304	Why do return flight costs vary depending on the country of origin?	<p>I had planned for my wife, daughters and I to take a holiday from our home in China to the UK for a few weeks in July. Usually, when people visit us in China from the UK, the cost is around £450 to £500 for a return flight. Looking online, I can see that such tickets are available. However, when I looked at the flights from China to the UK the costs for return tickets were in the £850 to £1,000 range.</p>  <p>This seems unfair. Buying the same ticket on the same airplane results in vastly different prices depending on your origin. What justification is there for airlines to charge double the price for return flights from China to the UK and back as for the return flights from UK to China and back?</p>  <p>As it stands this will end our vacation plans as the cost has gone from an expensive £2000 trip for the family to an astronomical £4000 trip, equal to my entire years salary.</p> 
12766	Why is public transport from/to the airport so expensive?	<p>In the different places in the world, I always have the feeling that public transport from/to the airport is really expensive for what you actually get.</p>  <p>Here are a few prices for a couple of airport and additional information to be able to compare (I wanted to create a nice table but didn't find how to do it) :</p>  <ol> <li><p>Sydney Domestic Airport Station</p>  <ul> <li>15.90 AUD one way using <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/price.php">Airport Link</a></li> <li>6.3 km to Sydney Central Station by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> <li>Sydney Central to Ashfield seems to be the same distance and costs 3.60 AUD (8.4 km) using <a href="http://www.131500.com.au/tickets/fares/fares#mytrain">the train</a></li> </ul></li> <li><p>Sydney International Airport Station</p>  <ul> <li>16.70 AUD one way using <a href="http://www.airportlink.com.au/price.php">Airport Link</a></li> <li>9.2 km to Sydney Central Station by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> <li>Sydney Central to Croydon seems to be the same distance and costs 3.60 AUD (9.44 km) using <a href="http://www.131500.com.au/tickets/fares/fares#mytrain">the train</a></li> </ul></li> <li><p>Melbourne Tullamarine Airport</p>  <ul> <li>17 AUD one way, $28 return using <a href="http://melbourneairport.com.au/To-From-the-Airport/Skybus/Overview.html">SkyBus</a></li> <li>24 km to Melbourne Southern Cross Station by car (from <a href="http://melbourneairport.com.au/To-From-the-Airport/Skybus/Overview.html">Google Maps</a>)</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Paris Charles-De Gaulle</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/fr-FR/Passagers/Acces-Plans-Parking/Paris-CDG/Acces/Transports-En-Commun/Paris-Charles-Gaulle-Transports-Commun.htm">Depending on the transport</a> : 9.25 EUR (RER) ; 10 EUR (Roissybus)</li> <li>30 km to Chatelet les Halles by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Paris Orly</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/fr-FR/Passagers/Acces-Plans-Parking/Paris-Orly/Acces/Transports-En-Commun/paris-orly-transports-en-commun.htm">Depending on the transport</a> : 6.50 EUR (RER+BUS) ; 10.90 EUR (Orlyval), 7 EUR (Orlybus)</li> <li>17 km to Chatelet les Halles by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> <li>Chatelet les Halles to Villeneuve-Saint Georges seems to be the same distance and costs 4.10 EUR using <a href="http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/c_20585/titres-tarifs/">the RER</a></li> </ul></li> <li><p>London Gatwick</p>  <ul> <li>19.90 GBP using <a href="http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/">Gatwick Express</a>, a bit cheaper using other slower rail companies</li> <li>43km to London Victoria  by car (from <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">Google Maps</a>)</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Why is the price so high ?

46129	Does Schengen visa proof of transport requirement include travel inside Europe?	<p>The Schengen checklist for short stay when applying from South Africa via France includes this (emphasis mine):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"All transfers (flight/ferry/train/bus/taxi) showing entry &amp; exit from   France <em>and between other countries</em> must be provided. Name of   applicant must appear on all proof of transport."</p> </blockquote>  <p>My flights are booked, I have proof of arrival from my country and a long series of flights to leave the schengen area and return home. There is a ferry into France and a flight from Berlin to Dublin (outside Schengen).</p>  <p>However, I prefer not to book some of my transport inside Europe because many train and bus systems do not allow me to book more than 90 days in advance (I am in the schengen area for 82 days). Is this something the visa people are likely to be difficult about, given that movement once one is inside the Schengen area is not supposed to be important?</p>

19036	Can you travel to Canada by road with an expired US passport?	<p>Is it possible to leave and re-enter the US through the land border with Canada with an expired (US) passport? My passport expired in December and I didn't realize that until now. In addition to the expired passport, I have my naturalization certificate and Tennessee issued drivers license to prove citizenship and residency. Re-entry will be by road from Canada.</p>  <p>UPDATE:  I made some calls and was told that I needed a passport -- I was told to contact the regional passport agency in New Orleans (about 6 hours by road for me) get an appointment and show up in person with proof of imminent travel outside the country. After searching on the web, I located a few agencies who claimed that they could help with this for a charge of around $199. I picked the one that had good reviews and they helped take care of the problem. On Monday they walked me through different documents they needed, asked me to go to a "Passport Verification" agent in a post office to get everything verified and sealed in an envelope, had to FedEx the package to them. On Tuesday they got it, processed the passport and shipped it back to me. I got it Wednesday. In all it cost me $170 (Govt Passport Fee) + $25 (Verification fee at the post office) + $199 (Agency charge) + $90 (Shipping). Glad i got this taken care of. Thanks to everyone who helped with responses. </p> 
46221	I pay triple the price originating a flight from US, (L.A.- Amsterdam) versus the opposite (Am-L.A)	<p>I heard that the reason why we pay almost triple the price from a flight originating in the US is because the US charges over $700 in taxes on an international flight.

6541	Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?	<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa. I hold an Indian passport and a valid US visa. I'm travelling from Chicago-Heathrow-Budapest and returning by Budapest-Dublin-Chicago.</p>  <p>Would I need a transit visa for UK/Ireland?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>  <p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>  <p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa. They said I could have transited happily if the connecting flight was in the same day, but because I would have to originally land at 10 PM and catch the connecting flight next morning at 10 AM, I needed a transit visa. Well, I thought it was BS, but couldn't help comply with the rules. I booked another last minute ticket and flew via Warsaw via LOT.  </p> 
1995	Any suggestions to ensure safety while hitchhiking?	<p>A female friend of mine plans to travel trough Europe next month. She wants to hitchhike. Although she has done it several times before, she is looking for some tips to make the tour safer.</p>  <p>I could recommend here the following hints:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Always ask the driver where he goes before you say where you go</p></li> <li><p>Dress appropriate so that you're not confused with a prostitute which are also very often standing at streets and waiting for cars</p></li> </ul>  <p>Are there any other hints?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
19235	Places worth visiting by train from Munich to Berlin	<p>My partner and I are planning to take a train from Munich to Berlin and stop over at a few cities on the way. As it will be our first time visiting Germany for 7 days, can you please advise which is the best route to take and which are the cities and places that should not be missed?</p> 
10553	How to travel (relatively) cheaply by ICE trains in Germany?	<p>When I first checked prices for ICE trains in Germany, I was a bit shocked by prices of over 100 Euros (in Poland not long ago the trains were the cheapest way of public transport). </p>  <p>But then I found out that there are some promotions such as <a href="http://www.bahn.de/p/view/bahncard/ueberblick/bahncard25.shtml?dbkanal_003=L01_S01_D001_KAF0001_affilinet-3101-BahnCard25-148420_LZ01" rel="nofollow">BahnCard 25</a> and it's possible to travel cheaply if you <a href="http://www.spartipp.de/reise/bahn/29-euro-bahn-fahrkarten-fuer-ic-und-ice-deutschlandweit.html" rel="nofollow">book the ICE in advance</a> (something similar to a plane).</p>  <p>But how is it in practice with these promotions? How to use them to really save money, for example, when someone wants to do a round trip once a month?</p> 
8458	Cheap bus lines in Germany, something like Orangeways?	<p>Are there any cheap bus lines inside Germany? Something like <a href="http://www.orangeways.com">Orangeways</a>?</p>  <p>I've checked Deutsche Bahn cost for transport from Berlin to München and I was shocked with the price about 100 Euro. By Orangeways similar distance costs about 20 Euro... Is there any operator that allows to travel in Germany with so attractive prices?</p> 
14917	Berlin to Munich in 5 Days	<p>My wife and I are going to spend our anniversary in Germany in May. We are flying into Berlin and out of Munich, and we have 5 days to get from one place to the other. What would be a good general route?</p>  <p>Important considerations:</p>  <ul> <li>We love to experience German culture more-or-less as a German would experience it, and we don't feel particularly inclined toward extremely touristy areas. That's not to say we'll completely shun them though.</li> <li>We love the outdoors. Hikes are great.</li> <li>We could potentially spend some time in the Austrian Alps just south of Munich. Are there any small towns that would be good to visit where we can go on hikes, etc?</li> </ul>  <p>And here's a twist: My wife will not know where we're going between Berlin and Munich. I will be giving her a <a href="http://blog.geocaching.com/2010/06/the-reverse-geocaching-puzzle-box-geocaching-com-lost-found-video/">reverse geocache box</a> which will only tell her the general direction we need to travel in, to facilitate some meandering and exploring. She only knows we'll end up in Munich eventually.</p>  <p>EDIT:</p>  <p>The whole vacation will be longer; only the 5 days in the middle are unplanned. We'll have plenty of opportunity to see Berlin and Munich outside of those 5 days.</p> 
6358	What is preferable, Eurail Pass or Buying Pass on the spot?	<p>I plan to visit 3 countries in Europe during May: Paris, Italy and England ( in that order). I will be staying in each country for 1 week; at the end of the week I will be moving on from a country to another. </p>  <p>Edit: Here are more updates on my research. This is my travelling schedule:</p>  <ol> <li>Paris</li> <li>Bordeaux</li> <li>Lyon</li> <li>Milan</li> <li>Florence</li> <li>Rome</li> <li>London </li> </ol>  <p>I plan to use Eurail pass when I travel from Paris to Rome, and I will take a flight from Rome to London.</p>  <p>My question is, is it more worthwhile to by a <a href="http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/select-pass/3-countries" rel="nofollow">Selected Pass with three countries ( because the train from Lyon to Milan stops by Geneva)</a>, or is it more worthwhile to buy the ticket separately?</p>

46090	Visiting Denmark with a prior overstay	<p>I have visited two time in Denmark where my husband lives. Last time I went there was 8 years ago. I applied for a permanent visa which is refused and I overstayed there for 10 days because I never got a ticket to come back.</p>  <p>Now they won't even give me a visit visa. I have two children holding Danish nationality. I have tried two time for visit visa but it was refused. Now I want to try again to apply for visit visa can u give any advise about it? My husband has Danish nationality. My first son is 10 year old and second is 1 year old they both have Danish passports and they live with me in Pakistan because they can't live without me my husband always came Pakistan after 9 months. They said in refusal that I might be trying to live permanently in Denmark. </p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
43808	Is the UK planning to introduce exit checks in 2015?	<p>Someone from America is a tourist/visitor here who has overstayed their 6 month 'leave to enter'.  In order to avoid getting caught, they are relying upon the fact that the UK does only random, sporadic exit checks on departing passengers.  In the absence of an exit check, there is no exact record of when the person left and so overstaying cannot be detected.</p>  <p>Is this likely to change in the the near future?  Will tourists leaving the UK be uniformly subjected to immigration control to assure (among other things) that they have not overstayed?  If so, when should an overstayer leave by so as not to get caught after activation?</p> 
19915	Is there Wi-Fi in the ICE trains in Germany?	<p>I will travel from Frankfurt to Berlin by ICE and I wanted to ask if there is Wi-Fi in the trains and how much does it cost?</p> 
24003	Is it safe and legal to sleep in my car in California (L.A. area)?	<p>I will be visiting California and some parts of the US West Coast in the coming September. I'd like to rent a car for travelling, and to reduce travel expenses I would like to sleep in it some nights. I've already done it on a past trip to Iceland and I'm accustomed to it.</p>  <ul> <li>Is it legal to sleep in the car during the night in California and USA in general?</li> <li>Is is generally safe to sleep in the car during the night?  I'll be traveling around LA and San Francisco.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm an Italian citizen and never been to USA before, if that matters.</p> 
758	Can I rent a camper in the US/Canada with a European B license?	<p>We are considering a holiday in North America with a camper. I have a European driver's license (B) which allows me to drive personal cars up to 3500 kg, although I can imagine that an average camper easily weighs more.</p>  <p>Does my license qualify me to drive a camper? If not, can I take an American/Canadian driver's test which would allow me to drive a camper?</p> 
45787	Restroom facilities near Saint Chad's Well (Sacred Spring in England)	<p>A visitor to the UK wants to visit the sacred spring associated with Saint Chad (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwell_Heath" rel="nofollow">Chadwell Heath</a> -- Not the other ones in Mercia and Lichfield and Staffordshire) for its reputed healing and spiritual nourishment powers.  See <a href="http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18532" rel="nofollow">Megalithic</a> for details.</p>  <p>The spring is on public land, but there are no public toilet facilities in the immediate area.  Where would the nearest public toilet facility be that someone could use?  Assume normal day time hours.  Night and bank holidays can be excluded, but something open on bank holidays would be gratefully received.</p>  <p><strong>Adding...</strong></p>  <p>Owing to commentary, a photo is now added...</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/czmwXm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

23548	Is layover of 1hr enough at Nassau Airport to catch flight to Eleuthera?	<p>We will be arriving from USA to Nassau and our connecting flight leaves exactly 1hr after we arrive so is that enough time to catch it when going to ELH (N. Eleuthera)?</p>  <p>Is there a customs line we have to go thru?</p>  <p>We can take a different flight that is a 1-stop and get there in enough time but that means leaving at 5am in the morning plus a 1-stop also may have it's own set of issues so should we chance it?</p> 
12870	What does "copy of itinerary" mean when applying for a Schengen visa?	<p>The Italian consulate website says under requirements for a Schengen visa:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Applicants for short term visas (up to 90 days) <strong>must also present an itinerary of their trip</strong>.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>What does this mean? This is separate from the proof of return ticket:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Return-trip booking or proof of available means of personal transport:   ticket reservations for round-trip flights originating in our jurisdiction to Europe (and ultimately to Italy) and back, including internal entry and exit points of travel i.e. EURORAIL tickets, car rental, internal flights. The names of reservations should reflect the name on passport. The applicant may be required to show the actual ticket when picking up the visa;</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>When they ask for an itinerary, what documents need to be shown? Is it enough to have a plan of which places I am going to visit and where I will be staying?</p> 
44451	Practical food to take on flight without anything served?	<p>It seems that my local airline had really cut down on feeding passengers lately. Last time they only had food for sale (despite flight booking mentioning a meal). And what little they had sold out immediately thanks to extra 3h sitting in the plane, waiting for de–icing.</p>  <p>I have round trip flight booked with them soon and now it's even clearly "no meal served" on the booking, despite flights being noticeable 3.5h in length.</p>  <p>So I am pondering what are the <em>optimal</em> options here. I guess the limitations are:</p>  <ol> <li>Security friendly (nothing remotely liquid).</li> <li>Off the shelf (no kitchen before heading back).</li> <li>Convenient to consume.</li> </ol>  <p>My thoughts keep circling chocolate bars... Doesn't seem particularly appealing as main mid–day meal.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
28937	Which consulate should issue me a Schengen visa if I transit through several Schengen states?	<p>I am an Iranian citizen holding a U.S. permanent resident card (Green Card). My itinerary is as follows:<br> <strong>Los Angeles – Frankfurt – Vienna – Tehran</strong></p>  <p>Apparently I need a visitor visa due to the fact that I have a "domestic" flight within the Schengen zone (Frankfurt–Vienna). Which consulate should I get my Schengen visa from: Germany or Austria?</p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey. He booked <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> and <em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>.<br> Somehow he needed to be earlier at location <em>B</em>, so he took a train and did not take the flight from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.</p>  <p>When he went to the airport to take the "back home" flight (<em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>), he was informed that his ticket was canceled because he did not take the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> flight. They canceled the ticket and sold it to someone else.</p>  <p>Is this normal? The company said it was their right to do so, and he could not get the flight back.<br> The company was Iberia.</p>

39723	"Airport-friendly" suspenders with AIT	<p>I regularly wear <a href="http://www.suspenders.com/everyday-suspenders/underups/no-buzz-und-xl/">these suspenders</a> with "airport-friendly" plastic clasps, designed to be worn under your shirt.  However, I will be traveling to an airport that used Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) full-body scanners, and I wanted to get an idea of what to expect.  Depending on the answers, I may just leave them off and pray my pants stay up until I can get to a restroom, which is a tall order given my body shape.  Assuming I opt to leave them on:</p>  <ul> <li>Do they trigger an alert?</li> <li>If so, am I better off requesting a pat down from the beginning?</li> <li>If I get a pat down, will they make me remove them anyway?</li> <li>I am traveling with my five year-old daughter.  How can I keep a pat down from affecting my ability to keep an eye on her?</li> </ul> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

3080	OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?	<p>OK so for anyone that's travelled beyond North America and Western Europe you know what I'm talking about.</p>  <p>Left: Romania, last year. Right: Turkey, last night. <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdIOW.jpg" alt="squat toilets"></p>  <p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>  <p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>  <p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>  <p>So let's give it a try...</p>  <p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>  <p>Squat down like the name says...</p>  <p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>  <p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>  <p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>  <p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>  <p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>  <p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p> 
16674	Where can I find the restrictions and easements that apply to a given UK Rail Ticket?	<p>UK rail ticketing isn't always the simplest thing in the world, but the basics aren't too hard to learn. There are <a href="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Train-times-and-tickets/Ticket-types">broadly</a> tickets valid at any time of the day, those available only outside of peak hours (typically after 9 and perhaps not in the evening rush hour), tickets only available at quiet times, tickets valid only on one train. These are mostly, but not always, valid in flavours of single (one way), day return (out and back the same day-ish), and (period) return (out on a given day, back within a month). That's it broadly, but you'll notice there's a bit of variation in even just those...</p>  <p>Next up, there are rules on what sort of route you can take. These largely revolve around <a href="http://www.atoc.org/about-atoc/rail-settlement-plan/routeing-guide">routing points</a>, not doubling back, direct trains normally being fine, and not taking too long a route if there's a choice. (There's a whole art to making the most of that though, but this isn't the question for that!)</p>  <p>On top of all that, certain routes and/or stations will have additional restrictions, or easements where default restrictions are lifted. For example, one station might be in an area where the default rule is "off peak tickets valid after 9am", then has an additional restriction "off peak tickets to London only valid on trains arriving after 10am", and an easement "off peak tickets to stations along the <em>insert line name here</em> valid after 08:45".</p>  <p>By looking up these restrictions and easements, it's sometimes possible to save money on your journey. In the example above, you might assume you'd need a peak time ticket to travel on the 08:54 to a station along the local branch line, but the easement actually allows you to travel on a cheaper off-peak ticket instead.</p>  <p>How do you go about looking up what easements apply to a given ticket for a journey, and equally what extra restrictions (eg evening peak times or not-valid-via) apply?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

25705	Which embassy will most likely provide a multiple entry Schengen visa?	<p>I have already travelled to schengen area once on a single entry Schengen visa. I am now trying to apply for a schengen visa with the intention of making several short trips to the schengen area. </p>  <p>My plan is to go to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Portugal in the next 6 months.</p>  <p>Which of the above embassies is most likely to provide a multiple entry visa? I can then tailor my plans and apply to that embassy to ensure I get a multiple-entry visa.</p> 
21703	Schengen visa for two subsequent short trips: One visa or two?	<p>I will go to France from 17/12/13 – 19/12/13, then I will come back to London. And again I will go back to Portugal and Spain from 26/12/13 to 03/01/14 which I will stay in Spain for the longest period. However, the Spanish consulate told me that I have to request for the visa from the French consulate.</p>  <p>The point is: Do I need to apply for a visa for a single trip two times (from French and Spanish consulate) or a single visa for multiple time (from French consulate).</p> 
42495	Entering Schengen area twice within 90 days	<p>I'm thinking about making two separate one-week trips into the Schengen area, the first to Germany and the second to France. The whole duration of both trips together lie within 90 days. I'm afraid that if I wait until after the first trip to apply for the visa for the second trip, it won't be in time. Can I apply to the German embassy for a double-entry visa, or what should I do?</p> 
17536	Going to Italy for 2 days then back to UK for 4 days then to France for 2 weeks. Which embassy should I apply to for my Schengen visa?	<p>I've got a dilemma. I am going on my holiday to France for two weeks in July but few days before that I need to fly to Italy for 2 days. So my traveling plan is: going to Italy for two days then back to the UK then a week later going to France for two weeks. What embassy should I apply for my Schengen visa? French or Italian. I'm scared that if I apply for the Italian one (where I'm going for two days) and then a week later will go to France for two weeks I might have problems. Or if I apply for the French embassy but then my first country I will enter on this visa will be Italy I will have trouble. I know traveling within the Schengen countries should be no problem but I need to go back to UK in-between so I won't have the continuation of the trip. Don't know what to do!!!</p> 
25091	How to fill questions 25, 29 and 30 for Multi entry Schengen visa form	<p>I am going to have two separate short trips(non consecutive) in June to two countries in Schengen zone. I am trying to fill in a form for multi entry Schengen visa. But the form seems to be compiled for single entry visa. I am not quiet sure how to fill in answers for the following questions. </p>  <pre><code>25. Duration of the intended stay or transit Indicate number of days </code></pre>  <p>Should I just enter the total like 9 days? Or something like 4 + 5. Or maybe 4 and 5</p>  <pre><code>29. Intended date of arrival in the Schengen Area </code></pre>  <p>This one should I write 1st June? Or 1st June and 15th of June. </p>  <pre><code>30. Intended date of departure from the Schengen Area </code></pre>  <p>Same for this just 20th of June?

28990	Can I have two Schengen visas in one passport?	<p>I will have to visit Europe twice for five months in total. I am Thai and will need a visa. The maximum stay in europe is 90 days, otherwise you have to apply for a long term stay according to my research. However, it will be complicated and time consuming.</p>  <p>This is my travel plan:</p>  <ul> <li>Aug - Sep: Munich</li> <li>Sep - Nov: France (I have to complete a short course in Paris which is not more than 90 days)</li> <li>Nov - Dec: Munich again </li> </ul>  <p>I am aware that I need to leave and re-enter the country when the duration reaches 90 days. Can I apply for a tourist visa in Germany's embassy for 90 days that's valid in six months and a second visa from France for 90 days. In between these trips, I will leave the continent to Russia or Turkey where a visa is not required and re-enter again.</p>  <p>Therefore I need two Schengen visas but is it possible to have two Schengen visas in one passport?</p>

46323	Ireland Transit Visa when flying from IND - Abu Dhabi - Dublin - US	<p>My parents are Indian Citizens. They hold a valid B2 Tourist Visa to USA. I'm planning to book a flight with Hyderabad (India) - Abu Dhabi (UAE) - Dublin (Ireland) - USA. The leg from Hyderabad to Dublin is operated by Etihad and I know there is no problem hopping at Abu Dhabi. The leg from Dublin to US is operated by Aer Lingus. I called Aer Lingus customer care agent told me a transit visa is required to land in Dublin. She did not care to ask for the citizenship of traveller or about the USA visa. I went through Irish immigration website - (<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Transit%20Visas" rel="nofollow">http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Transit%20Visas</a>), India is not in list of countries that require transit visa. I'm now confused. Can some one confirm if they traveled with the same itinerary recently</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> I called Aer Lingus again. Another agent told as long as I don't exit airport, transit visa is not required. I think these people don't really understand trouble we go through when boarding is denied. I put this question because I read a person was denied boarding earlier - <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/6541/do-i-need-a-uk-or-ireland-transit-visa-when-flying-from-the-us-to-a-schengen-cou">Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?</a>.

21650	Must I enter Europe with Schengen visa from the country where I applied?	<p>If I applied for a Schengen visa from "country A" and I got the visa but I had some commitments in "country B" and I have to finish it before going to Europe should I get back to "country A" to travel to Europe or can I use the visa from any where? </p> 
38488	Airplane ticket booked under my middle name	<p>I use my middle name pretty much everywhere.  At work I used to book travel myself and would always book under my first and last name.  We recently hired an admin who booked travel using my middle and last name.</p>  <p>Jet blue refused to change the ticket (or perhaps wasn't able to?).  The only option was to cancel the flight and re-book it at the last minute price, of course.  The other option is to show up to the flight and risk TSA refusing to let me travel.</p>  <p>Any advice?</p> 
7982	What kind of passport do I need when entering the USA?	<p>I heard that you need a biometric passport if you want to enter USA.

776	Long Term Travel - what insurances can / should I get?	<p>I'm a freelancer in the field of software development and I'm planning to travel to different places, but also continue working. I'd expect to stay at a certain place (country) for 1-3 months. Pretty much living a nomadic life for a while.</p>  <p>What I'm wondering now, is, what type of insurance should I get and also what can I get, to be covered internationally. I guess the most important one is health insurance.</p>  <p>Not sure if that is important at all, but maybe I should mention that I'm a German citizen. However, I haven't lived in Germany for 4 years. Until now I've always lived in different countries, but for at least a year, and thus could get local insurances. However, if I would only stay in a country for 1-3 months I guess there is too much bureaucratic overhead to get local insurances.</p> 
4061	Travel health insurance that counts as "credible coverage"	<p>I am taking a long-term international trip of around 11 months. I am quitting my job, and so will lose my health insurance.</p>  <p>I am looking at different travel health insurance plans such as World Nomads and HTH. I will likely not have any domestic health coverage.</p>  <p>My concern is that when I return from the trip, whether or not US Insurers will recognize my travel health insurance as "credible coverage" and not as a gap in insurance (for which I could be excluded from coverage for certain conditions by a future insurer under U.S. law)</p>  <p><em>Does anyone have experience with this, returning from a long-term trip and trying to get insured?</em></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>  <p>After researching World Nomads, IMG Global, and HTH Worldwide, I ended up selecting the highest possible deductible ($25,000) plan with HTH. This gave me a global health insurance plan (incl. USA) that cost about the same as the World Nomads plan, but without any of the additional travel coverages like trip cancellation, interruption, baggage coverage, etc. This plan counts as "creditable coverage" by US standards and is the least expensive plan I could find if your goal is just maintaining "creditable coverage".</p>

13304	What extra benefits are there in getting travel insurance if I have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)?	<p>I've got a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and only plan to travel around the EU for the foreseeable future.

If the EHIC gives me equal medical care as I would get in England, what's the point of paying more? Does travel insurance usually provide extra cover that an EHIC won't?</p>

25537	Is it legal to study while on a tourist Schengen visa?	<p>If, say, you acquired a 90-day tourist Schengen visa, would it be legal to use it for the purpose of visiting a language course or a university class?

22851	Refund rules for a confirmed ticket vs non-confirmed ticket booked through Tatkal scheme of Indian railways	<p>I have a few questions before I try to book a ticket through Tatkal scheme of Indian Railways:</p>  <ol> <li>I would like to know if I book a tatkaal ticket on irctc website for indian railways and I <strong>do not get a confirm ticket</strong>, can I get refund of the money?</li> <li>Also if I happen to cancel a <strong>confirmed tatkaal ticket</strong>, is there any refund scheme?</li> </ol>  <p>Edit: I did check the <a href="http://www.indianrail.gov.in/refund_Rules.html" rel="nofollow">refund rules in the Indian railways website</a> and I found out the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>No refund of fare shall be admissible on confirmed Tatkal ticket.    In case of Tatkal ticket on <strong>waitlist</strong>, refund of fare shall be granted in   accordance with rule for unused waitlisted or RAC tickets.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I guess the answer to my first question above is <em>yes</em> and the answer to the second question is <em>no</em> unless rules have changed recently and they are not yet documented.</p>  <p>But the second line of the quote above only mentions about waitlisted tatkaal tickets.</p>  <ol> <li>Is there no concept of RAC tickets through Tatkal scheme?</li> <li>What does the rule for unused waitlisted or RAC tickets say?

2684	Is it technically illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba?	<p>There is a belief that US citizens would be doing something illegal if they were to visit Cuba.</p>  <p>I remember hearing years ago while in Mexico where lots of people go on sidetrips to Cube that it's not illegal for Americans to visit Cuba but that if they spend any money there they would technically be breaking the law of "dealing with the enemy"?</p>  <p>So what's the real story? Is this all outdated or is it illegal for people from USA to go to Cuba? Or is the thing about them spending money there true? What are the real legal ramifications, if any?</p> 
730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p>

203	How do you avoid "tourist traps" when traveling to a country where you do not speak the language?	<p>Too many easily accessible restaurants and attractions cater heavily to tourists, and, in doing so, create an environment that they feel will be comfortable to people from other cultures.  </p>  <p>Spending too much time in these locations sometimes leads with only a superficial understanding of the culture.

33891	Travel in the Schengen area after my residence card was lost or stolen	<p>I have already booked my flight from Italy to the Netherlands through Ryanair. I'm staying in Italy legally and have a <em>carta di soggiorno</em>. However, after booking my flight, my wallet was stolen, which contains all my IDs except my passport. I filed a police report, and I'm trying to get a new residence card. However, I need to go to the Netherlands ASAP. Will Ryanair accept the police report and receipt of getting a new residence card from the post office?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE (17.07.2014)</strong></p>  <p>Thanks for helping me out. BTW it's OK now. I went to our local CISL here in Florence, Italy, where they process your envelope for renewing your <em>permesso di soggornio</em> or <em>carta di soggiorno</em> (residence permit for foreigners) to be submitted to the post office. That's where you pay and get your postal receipt, and they make an appointment for you at the questura. Anyway, long story short, they processed a application for IMPROVISED residence permit which is good for 30 days to travel within the Schengen area, so all I have to do is go to the questura, bring my travel booking, the police report and copy of my passport. Now I can travel, and it's my first time to fly with Ryanair because I always use Transavia to go to Holland. =) Hope this helps for future persons who will have the same issue with lost or stolen residence permits...Just wish me luck that the questura will process my improvised residence permit immediately.</p>

42005	How to check a large backpack?	<p>When travelling on airlines based in the US with a large backpack, I prefer to carry the bag onto the plane as part of my hand baggage allowance.  Most foreign flag carriers, however, have a significantly more restrictive hand baggage allowance.  I was caught off guard by this one time on New Zealand airlines and received my backpack with multiple broken straps and clips.  I managed to repair it, and I'm still using the same pack, but I would like to avoid so many broken parts in the future.  </p>  <p>Once, when flying Alitalia (flight was actually booked through Delta) I carried plastic wrap to the airport, and wrapped the entire bag in it before handing it over to the airline.  @jpatokal recommends putting it into a giant, heavy-duty garbage bag in his answer to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/23855/9872">this question</a>.  </p>  <ul> <li>What are the pros and cons of using plastic wrap or a garbage bag?  </li> <li>Can anyone recommend any other, more effective techniques?</li> </ul> 
47048	Travel protection bag OK at airport?	<p>I have a travel protection bag in which my whole suitcase fits. It's just a nylon zippered suitcase-size bag with a handle; when the suitcase is in it the whole thing just looks just like a lumpy duffel bag. Someone suggested that the airlines would not like it because </p>  <ol> <li>the wheels and handle do not stick out, so that baggage handlers can't use them, and </li> <li>it's one more thing to unzip if the customs wants to search my baggage en route. </li> </ol>  <p>Are either of these objections valid? As for (1), the hiding of the wheels and handles is one plus for me, because I have had damage to the handles of my suitcases en route. As for (2), I like the bag because I don't lock the zips on the suitcase, so the bag makes sure that things don't accidentally fall out. Yes, I know about the plastic wrapping, but not all airports have it, and you have to pay for it when they do. So, should I use my luggage protection bag? </p>

23852	How to find budget accommodation in Iran?	<p>I usually stay in hostels or guest houses when travelling, it is much easier to meet people than in hotels and usually cheaper too.</p>  <p>Coming up is a trip through Iran and the usual suspects like <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/">hostelworld</a> and <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/">Hostelbookers</a> don't even list that country.</p>  <p>I don't actually think that there are proper hostels in Iran, but there must be some budget accommodation used by travelers where people speak some English.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a> used to be a good source, but even they seem to care less about people travelling on a shoestring these days. </p>  <p>Does anybody has any tips on how to find places to stay?</p> 
38487	UK Family Visa Refused, how long till I reapply?	<p>I applied for a family visa on 19th October 2014 and today (10 November.'14) I got the refusal letter. The documents I have provided are listed below:</p>  <ol> <li>Sponsor's invitation letter</li> <li>Sponsor's bank statement</li> <li>Employer's certificate</li> <li>House rent agreement</li> <li>Copy of sponsor's passport </li> <li>My FDR of National Deposit Bureau of Government </li> <li>Ownership document of my apartment</li> </ol>  <p>However, I intended to stay there for 6 months but being cautious I started to proceed for a 2 year visa which was the very first point that they mentioned in the refusal letter. Was that a reason of my refusal?</p>  <p>As I have been retired from Government service in 2007, I didn't provide any bank-statement in my name. But I DID submit the 'Certificate of FDr (Fixed Deposit)'[as mentioned in list_item# 6] of my pension amount and corresponding monthly interest from it which they completely ignored and stated as "have not provided any other evidence of stated monthly income".</p>  <p>Besides, they also mentioned about the absence of evidence of my living circumstances here in Bangladesh although I have provided the ownership documents of my OWN apartment. Wasn't that enough to make them convince that I live in my own apartment right now?</p>  <p>Moreover, I have another fixed deposit on '6-months interest' payment-basis. Probably that was a mistake from my side that I only provided the receipt of accessing it on 2008 but not afterwards.I assume that was one of the reasons.</p>  <p>Finally, the refusal letter mentioned their doubt about my previous stay in the UK back in 1975. I studied and worked there for 6 and a half years which I mentioned in my form but unfortunately couldn't manage any supporting documents against it. What sort of document was I supposed to submit?</p>  <p>So, that was the details of the scenario now. What should I do in this case? Can I reapply right now? Or ask for an administrative review?</p>

39153	UK visa refusal	<p>I have applied recently for a general visitor visa to the UK to spend 10 days during Christmas with my British unmarried partner and it has been turned down. </p>  <p>The Entry Clearance Officer stated on his refusal notice the following:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I note that you have never previously travelled to the UK or any country with similar immigration requirements and you therefore do not have a history of travel and compliance to consider.</p>      <p>You have submitted an employment letter to confirm your occupation in KSA but I am required to also assess your personal, domestic and economic circumstances in determining whether you are genuine visitor travelling to the UK for the period and purpose you state.</p>      <p>You claim an income of SAR ........ per month which equal ........ GBP and from the evidence submitted this appears to be your sole source of income.   I note that this monthly income is reflected on your bank statements. However, the bank statement you have presented show a recent large deposit that are in excess of your stated income and inconsistent with the account history. You haven't provided evidence toward the origin of this recent deposit and in the absence of reasonable evidence I am not satisfied that these bank statements accurately reflect your personal circumstances.</p>      <p>In view of the above, I am not satisfied you have demonstrated that your circumstances are as you claim and therefore I am not satisfied that you're travelling to the UK for the period and purpose you stated. 41(i)and(ii).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Its true that I have deposited that sum of money right before I apply and it was a commission I received from work earlier this month. </p>  <p>So, could you please give me your advice on the above as I am planning to apply again soon. and how to avoid my application being refused again? </p> 
45092	Where can I travel for prolonged periods of time while legally working remotely for a company in my home country?	<p>I found several questions about inbound travelers to the US in this scenario, but little about other countries: I work for a company in my home country (USA) who are open to me working remotely while traveling. </p>  <p>Which countries allow me to legally work remotely for a company in my home country (USA) while traveling in their country? The work has absolutely no connection to the destination country, it would take place identically entirely within the USA if I weren't traveling.</p> 
30178	Where can I eat dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?	<p>... apart from western countries like the Australia or the USA themselves.</p>  <p>During my visit to Taiwan, I wasn't able to find the dishes I'd typically encounter in a Chinese restaurant in Australia or the United States, such as sweet and sour pork, honey chicken, Mongolian lamb/beef, and fried ice cream.</p>  <p>I have two main theories on why this is. One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_ice_cream">fried ice cream</a>, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.</p>  <p>The other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.</p>  <p>The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant">Chinese restaurant</a> mentions:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese   emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian   Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,   specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,   beginning in the 1980s.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the "Chinese restaurant" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.</p>  <p>Where, if anywhere, can I find the dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants? Also, how should I identify the right kind of eatery in those countries?</p>

42531	Historical airfare prices to understand which month has the lowest airfare	<p>Is there a service (don't mind paying a bit) that will tell me historically which month has the lowest airfare between two travel destinations?

46070	How close to the end of my Vietnam tourist visa can I still get an extension (through an agent)?	<p>I've got three days left on my tourist visa in Vietnam and really wouldn't mind staying.</p>  <p>When I was in Ho Chi Minh City I went to the immigration office and was told it's currently only possible to do a visa extension through an agent. At my hotel there I was told it costs $60 and takes one week. I'd already been in HCMC over a week and didn't want to sacrifice another there.</p>  <p>But now I'm in Dalat and could easily spend a week here. But there's so few days left on my visa, which I assume will be sent to HCMC anyway.</p>  <p>Is it too late to get an extension through an agent here in Dalat before my current visa expires in three days?</p> 
26089	Travelling to the US with codeine-based medicines	<p>I'm travelling to the US next month, and I'd like to take my codeine-based painkillers with me. In the UK these are available without a prescription, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug#United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">over the counter</a> from a pharmacist. (It isn't just available in any old supermarket like some painkillers, but can just be sold in a pharmacy under supervision from the pharmacist, no Doctor involved)</p>  <p>I see from <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/67/kw/prescription%20medicine" rel="nofollow">this CBP advice</a> that <em>prescription</em> medication must have a prescription label attached, but presumably this applies to medicines that are only available on prescription in the US.  So my question is twofold:</p>  <ul> <li>Can I bring my codeine-based painkillers to the US without a prescription?</li> <li>More generally, is there a list of medicines that are commonly available in other parts of the world but restricted in the US?</li> </ul> 
39971	Appropiate way to safely transportate heavy laptop during flight?	<p>I flew a long range flight carrying my <strong>laptop</strong>, a quite heavy one, inside a <strong>neoprene briefcase</strong> on the <strong>passenger cabin</strong>. The recommendation by the aircrew is to place them in the compartments above or below the front seat. However, during <strong>take-off and landing</strong>, the <strong>vibrations</strong> on the plane are quite strong and, as a result, it received minor <strong>damages</strong>. </p>  <p>Placing them in the above compartments might be equivalent as placing it in the floor, underneath the front seat, with the added hindrance of additional luggage.</p>  <p>I considered the <strong>alternative</strong> of holding it vertical by the handle while sitting, so it won't be any contact with the aircraft's floor. This is impracticable during cruise, but I thought it could be better during the take-off and landing segments.</p>  <p>Other option I considered is to wrap it with completely with bubble wrap before boarding the plane. </p>  <p>The damage the laptop sustained was not great, but I am afraid of further damage as the date of my return flight approaches.</p>  <p>The question is: </p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Which is the safest way to transport a laptop during flight?</strong></p>  <hr>  <p>I don't think it's an inappropiate question, as the requirements are clearly defined and surely must be an optimal way to transport heavy tech while travelling. Even if, for some reason, it's deemed unsuitable or off-topic, I truly believe that it's an important subject, and I would be most pleased to receive your input.</p> 
38549	Absolute cheapest transport from Malaysia to Singapore with e-ticket that can be bought online from overseas?	<p>I need an international e-ticket out of Malaysia to show to the airline when I board next week with a one-way ticket.</p>  <p>Last year I bought a second class train ticket from KL to Woodlands for about $10.</p>  <p>This time for fun and variety and a new little challenge I'd like to find an even cheaper ticket.</p>  <p><strong>I do not care where in Malaysia I get on, nor where in Singapore I get off!</strong></p>  <p><strong>I know what I'm doing.

9218	Renting a car in Ireland & Great Britain: 1 rental or 2?	<p>My wife, two kids and I will be traveling in Ireland and the UK Nov. 1st through 21st. We're flying into and out of Dublin. Our plan is to do a clockwise tour: Fly into Dublin -> Belfast -> Scotland -> England/London -> Back to Dublin to fly home.</p>  <p>We've been planning to rent a car when we land in Dublin (doing just things outside Dublin at the start of the trip) and have a car all the way until London, then turn in the car and take a train/ferry to get back to Dublin before flying home.</p>  <p>However, reading through the car rental section of Rick Steve's 2012 Ireland book is causing us to question if this is the right plan.  He says (p. 480):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If your trip covers both Ireland and Great Britain, you're better off   with two separate car rentals, rather than paying for your car to ride   the ferry between the two islands. On an all-Ireland trip, you can   drive your rental car from the Republic of Ireland into Northern   Ireland, but be aware of drop-off charges ($75-150) if you return it   in the North.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So it seems like he recommends against doing one car rental for both islands, but he also recommends against renting in the Republic of Ireland and returning it in Northern Ireland (our other option for our current itinerary).  So we're not sure which is best here.  A few questions about this:</p>  <ul> <li><p>If we do one car rental all the way from Dublin to London, will there be a similar $75-$150 fee?</p></li> <li><p>Is there an easy place to return a car on the Northern Ireland side of one of the Northern Ireland -> Scotland ferries, and an easy place on the Scotland side to rent a car?  We'd like to minimize the number of buses/whatever we need to take between car rentals since we'll be lugging around car seats for both of our children (on top of carrying them and our luggage).</p></li> <li><p>Will one way be significantly cheaper than the other?  Besides the basic cost of taking the car on the ferry and the drop-off charges, our credit card will cover insurance in Scotland/England but not in Ireland, so we could potentially get a better rental rate by renting a second vehicle once we're on Great Britain. Although, I know you often get a better rate when keeping a car rental for longer, so that may negate any benefit from the credit card covering the insurance.</p></li> </ul> 
41731	Travelling to the US on B1 visa without a business purpose	<p>(NOT a duplicate of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/39685/tourist-visa-b1">Tourist Visa B1</a>)</p>  <p>Earlier last year, I went to the US for a business trip.

46843	Schengen Visa - 2 Entries - 60 Days	<p>I got Schengen visa for my study course in Sweden which is valid between 12-Oct-14 and 08-JUN-15. The number of entries is 02 and number of days are 60. I spent 31 days during my first stay between 12 October and 11 November (both inclusive). I entered Sweden again on 23rd April. Do I have 29 days left or are they 60 since more than 6 months have passed since my first entry and the days are rolled over?</p>  <p>In case the visa is valid for only 29 days for this entry, I want to know how can I extend it being in Sweden?

17839	How to get from Gatwick airport to Paddington?	<p>What's the most straightforward way to get from Gatwick airport to Paddington station in London using public transport? </p>  <p>I'm mostly interested in travel time &amp; general smoothness of the trip (e.g. buying just one ticket for the whole trip would be nice). Price is a secondary concern. </p> 
37598	Can I get from Gatwick airport to London by Oyster card?	<p>I read many contradictions as to whether one can use a Oyster card from Gatwick Airport to central London.

4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
12870	What does "copy of itinerary" mean when applying for a Schengen visa?	<p>The Italian consulate website says under requirements for a Schengen visa:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Applicants for short term visas (up to 90 days) <strong>must also present an itinerary of their trip</strong>.</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>What does this mean? This is separate from the proof of return ticket:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Return-trip booking or proof of available means of personal transport:   ticket reservations for round-trip flights originating in our jurisdiction to Europe (and ultimately to Italy) and back, including internal entry and exit points of travel i.e. EURORAIL tickets, car rental, internal flights. The names of reservations should reflect the name on passport. The applicant may be required to show the actual ticket when picking up the visa;</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>When they ask for an itinerary, what documents need to be shown? Is it enough to have a plan of which places I am going to visit and where I will be staying?</p> 
17811	Can I fly domestically in the US using my university ID?	<p>Okay, so I'm an international Student here in the US. and My passport is being renewed right now.

1432	How can I get an 'invitation' to Russia?	<p>I understand that in order to get a visa to visit Russia you need an invitation before you can get a visa.</p>  <p>If you don't have family or friends that you are visiting and you aren't part of an organised tour, how can you obtain an invitation?</p> 
6545	Booking travel tickets for visa without paying?	<p>I am in the process of filling the forms for my wife and daughter (Chinese) to travel with me (British) to the UK for a short holiday. On the government advice located at <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/out-of-country/visitors.pdf">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/out-of-country/visitors.pdf</a> it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Accommodation and travel details</p>      <p>You may wish to submit  the following documents to help show us your   accommodation and travel arrangements in the UK and on which date you   intend to leave the UK. We advise that you do not make any payments   for accommodation,  travel and so on until you have received your   visa. </p>      <ul>   <li>Details of accommodation and return</li>   <li>travel bookings</li>   </ul>      <p>This could be:</p>      <ul>   <li>hotel booking confirmation (usually email) travel booking</li>   <li>confirmation (can be email or copy of tickets) travel agent</li>   <li>confirmation of both accommodation details with a supporting letter    from the occupant confirming  that you are able to stay there</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>But how do you have tickets for a flight if you haven't made payments.

26939	Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?	<p>I am a non-EU national, permanent UK Resident. Recently, my work issued me with a multiple Schengen visa with Norway as the first (main) point of entry. Now I want to go on holidays to Greece - do I need to apply to Schengen visa again, as Greece is not Norway and I am not going there for work?</p> 
47028	Berlin to Göttingen by Train or Bus	<p>What is the cheapest way to get to Gottingen from Berlin ? I checked the Bahn Website and found some routes from Tegel airport.  Are there any other cheaper routes ? </p>  <p>I also found something called "Savings fare". What is it ?</p> 
27719	Is a card without name valid for Deutsche Bahn online tickets?	<p>Deutsche Bahn requires travellers with online tickets to select some form of identification. For non-Europeans, the only practical option seems to be a credit card, and the website asks for the name and card number. Is a MasterCard debit card <em>without the cardholder's name</em> printed on the card acceptable?</p> 
47439	Canadian citizen (but not resident), do I need an ESTA to travel to the USA from Belgium?	<p>I am a Canadian citizen who lives in Belgium.  I want to visit NY this summer. Do I need a ESTA waiver for that?</p> 
37559	Why are plane tickets more expensive if they don't include a weekend?	<p>When I used to fly for business (depart and return within the work-week) I observed that ticket prices were much higher than if a weekend was included at one end or in the middle. I was told that it is because business travelers will pay more. I think that is outrageous! Why should the airline care if I depart on Tuesday and return Thursday of the same week, or the next week? Only because it is business travel?</p> 
11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
37439	Why are airlines against the transferring of tickets to other persons?	<p>Airlines usually either don't allow the transferring of tickets to another person after they've been purchased, or they do it at an extremely inflated price. What is the reason for doing this?</p>  <p>One idea I came up with would be to allow authorities to do background checks, but one could buy a ticket at the airport shortly before the flight. Of course, it would be more expensive and there would be the risk of a fully booked plane, but it is not impossible.</p> 
38983	Difference between air fare for same route	<p>Why there is huge difference in the air fare If booking in a single ticket and booking two ticket for the same route?</p>  <p>In my case:</p>  <ol> <li>Flying from New Delhi to Moscow (Aeroflot-Direct) 20000 INR then Moscow to Havana (Aeroflot-Direct) on a separate ticket costs 37000 INR – Total: 57000 INR.</li> <li>Now the same Aeroflot flight from New Delhi to Moscow and then Moscow to Havana in a single ticket costs 113000 INR.</li> </ol> 
45092	Where can I travel for prolonged periods of time while legally working remotely for a company in my home country?	<p>I found several questions about inbound travelers to the US in this scenario, but little about other countries: I work for a company in my home country (USA) who are open to me working remotely while traveling. </p>  <p>Which countries allow me to legally work remotely for a company in my home country (USA) while traveling in their country? The work has absolutely no connection to the destination country, it would take place identically entirely within the USA if I weren't traveling.</p>

39113	What is the average & max temperature of an airplane cargo hold?	<p>I want to take some chocolates to offer in my luggage. Chocolates are a bit sensitive to heat, though. What is the average temperature inside a cargo hold? 'Average by' itself can be misleading. What is the max temperature there?</p>  <p>I don't know much about airplane mechanics but I assume they have some cooling systems like any other engine. Such systems, depending on where they are placed, might influence temperature in the cargo hold. I also fear temperatures in the ground while exterior temperatures are higher, and luggage is being put inside. What are max temperatures near the airplane in such situation?</p>

34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
8248	How do I get compensation for messed-up flights?	<p>Short form: the airline I'm traveling on managed to mess up <em>every</em> leg of my round trip (international trip), ultimately costing me most of a day at each end and also some money for expenses along the way.  I'm not interested in vouchers, as I rarely fly and when I do why would I trust this carrier again?</p>  <p>What is the best strategy for obtaining financial compensation?  Or is that just the way the world works now and I'm out of luck? </p>  <p>Longer form (per request in comments): they sold me an itinerary that was tighter than they claimed, the first plane was late, they rebooked the missed flight with a two-leg one, the first of <em>those</em> was late, and I arrived about 16 hours late.  On the return trip the first flight was delayed 8 hours for a proposed ultimate delay of about 15 hours; I think I have that down to 10 after rebooking but I'm not home yet so we'll see.  I will have had about $125 in incidental expenses because of the delay, and the ticket price was about $1700.  Airline is Air Canada.</p>  <p>Blog posts with gory details: <a href="http://cellio.livejournal.com/930425.html">http://cellio.livejournal.com/930425.html</a> and <a href="http://cellio.livejournal.com/931959.html">http://cellio.livejournal.com/931959.html</a> .  The urgency alluded to in the latter is a family medical situation that came up just before I was due to leave anyway.  (It is only because of that that I got the less-late flight.)</p>

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
34818	Why is security screening done at the gate at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam) in the non-Schengen area?	<p>I've noticed that when taking non-Schengen flights at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam), there is no centralized security check after you enter the airport and go through passport control. Instead, the security check happens right at the gate. The security checkpoint opens about an hour before the flight departs from that gate. This system seems to have a huge number of disadvantages:</p>  <ul> <li>It must be really expensive - there's an X-ray machine, metal detectors, and for some gates even millimeter wave scanners at <em>each</em> gate. </li> <li>Also, adding to the expense, there are washrooms at <em>each</em> gate, since passengers can no longer use the common area washrooms after passing through security.</li> <li>It's really inconvenient for the passengers. There's no way to reach the seats inside the gate area before the security checkpoint opens, so people are forced to either wait far away in other areas of the airport, or (as I've seen many people do) sit on the floor, which is especially a problem for the elderly, etc.</li> <li>The security lineup tends to be very long, since all of a sudden an entire plane-full of people tries to pass through a checkpoint with very limited equipment (i.e. usually just 1 x-ray machine)</li> <li>Once inside the area, it's essentially an entire plane-full of people in a small area with no way to spread out, so there's always a shortage of seats</li> <li>There's no way to buy e.g. a bottle of water (not to mention duty-free alcohol) in the secure area of the airport and bring it onto the plane, something that is generally allowed in typical airports</li> <li>Security screening personnel must roam around the airport from gate to gate</li> </ul>  <p>I can think of only one advantage of this system: Arriving flights from non-Schengen countries (whose passengers must be re-screened for security) can just let people out of the plane through the gate - there's no need to "route" them through the secure area to a non-secure area, since everything is essentially a non-secure area. But surely this could have been solved at the airport design stage, as it is solved in many airports worldwide? Is this just a design oversight or a conscious decision? Are there other reasons to use such a system that I'm not thinking of? Is this typical in other European airports?</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
14045	How can I find the arrival gate for a flight?	<p>Finding the departure gate of any flight in real time is not a big deal, however arrival gates are more tricky. I checked at least four airport websites, and none of them provides such details. Is there a general way to obtain such information? I don't need real-time information, some recent historic data should be perfectly sufficient. </p>  <p>Of course, I understand that gates change all the time, especially for arrivals, but I'd like to have a ballpark idea where the arrival gate would be -- most airports have separate gate groups for domestic, Schengen and international flights, and these tend to be bunched together, so going from one to another takes no time at all. However, transferring between different gate groups might take significant time on some airports.</p>  <p>As to why I need it -- my girlfriend and myself are flying from different locations to the same destination with a small time interval within our flights, and I'd like to surprise her right after she passes border control.</p>  <p>Finally, if no general information is available, information about arrival gates on Vienna International Airport (VIE) is enough.</p> 
16514	Which meals are served on long flights and in what order?	<p>I'm flying <code>AMS</code> - <code>LAX</code> (with KLM) next month and return a month later. I was wondering which meals would be served and in what order?</p>  <p>Is there any logic behind it or does it depend on the choice of the carrier? One might think you'll be served the first meal in the timezone of departure and the last one in the timezone of arrival, but this can result in a double lunch or a double breakfast.</p>  <p>In case it might matter: We take off at 10am and land at noon and on the return flight takes off at 2pm and lands at 9am.</p>

35723	Is there a crowdfunding platform for trips?	<p>I often organise trips with a large group of friends. It is always a pain to get everybody to commit and pay in time to cover the deposits and/or book the tickets. It would be so convenient if it would be possible to let people commit similar to how people commit on a project on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" rel="nofollow">indiegogo</a> or <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" rel="nofollow">kickstarter</a>. </p>  <p>I was considering using indiegogo to setup a campaing, e.g. Lets go to Paris, and start making reservations once a minimal number of friends paid and committed to the trip. However, Indiegogo aims at reaching as many people as possible, whereas I would like to limit the crowd to very limited inner circle of friends. </p>  <p>Does a crowdfunding platform exist to cover very small travel projects to cover the initial costs? I could of course use the conventional method by letting people commit by transfer the initial funds by wire transfer. However, the beauty of projects like indiegogo, is that people commit and only if a target is reached their credit card is charged. If the target isn't reached, I don't have to deal with all the refunds. </p>

I got it to attend a technical conference. </p>  <ol> <li>I was curious to know if I give job interview during this visit?</li> <li>I may not have time in this visit, but what if I go after couple of months with $3000 of my saving to sustain for a month and look for job. Is this legal? </li> </ol>  <p>I know I need H1-B VISA to work there, but I feel it is easier to get job (even if sponsorship is needed) to be face2face with potential employers. So, is it legal to look for job with B1/B2 ? Can I mention that to immigration officer?</p>  <p>PS: Yes, I'm Software Developer :P</p>

39263	Indian Passport first page ripped - is this considered 'damaged'?	<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hs8hN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Hi All, My passport first page got ripped. Front side of this page has a Indian emblem and backside is a blank with no stamps or Visas. Other pages including visas, personal details, POE stamps everything looks good. Basically a brand new passport with more than 7 years validity. Will this be considered as damaged? Please help me with your answers ASAP as I have a travel plan to India end of this month for my own wedding. </p>  <p>This damage happened accidentally when I was scanning the pages.</p>

27745	Traveling from Downtown, Los Angeles to John Wayne Airport	<p>I am traveling to Los Angeles in August and I will be staying at a hotel located in Downtown.</p>  <p>I have a friend to meet at John Wayne Airport in Orange County and I will stay at his place for one night and he will drop me at the airport on the next day when he will leave for a business trip.</p>  <p>What is the least pricy way to travel from DTLA to John Wayne and back?</p>  <p>I have read there is a shuttle bus serving between Tustin Metrolink Station and John Wayne Airport, but it seems that the bus only runs in commute hours. Any way to travel outside the shuttle bus hours (during the daytime)?</p>  <p>I don't have a driving license so renting a car is not an option.</p>  <p>By the way, I won't be bringing my luggage along, so public transport is okay.</p> 
3620	Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month	<p>I would like to visit a few places in the states sometime next year, and I was thinking of doing a road trip while I'm at it. I could start in either Los Angeles or Montreal, and then I would like to visit Philadelphia, Phoenix and Las Vegas during my trip; plus whatever there is on the way between - national parks would be on top of the list. I had about $2000 in mind for transport (excluding fuel).</p>  <p>So my question is: how would I get around? I could take the trains or public transport between the States and Montreal because I don't want to have any hassle with importing/exporting a car, and only drive a car in the states. </p>  <p>The 2 options I see here are either buying a used car and then sell it at the end of the trip, or rent a car. </p>  <p>I had a look at hertz.com, and they quoted me ~$3500 (including insurance) for 1 month and this car: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/01dmk.jpg" alt="look mate, the orange car goes much faster!"></p>  <p>But it seems like I have to return the car to the pickup location with Hertz, because if I choose a different drop off location it shows "not available" for this car. Did I just pick the wrong drop off location here of is A->B really not an option? Do I get different rates at different locations? Has anyone advice on how to get this cheaper? I searched for "relocation" on their site, but didn't find anything.</p>  <p>The second option would be to buy a car for $3000, and then sell it at the end of my trip, and hopefully get more than $1000 back for it. Has anyone experience with this? Are there any places better for buying or for selling a car? In which state would I get "more car" for the same amount of money? Would there be any paperwork involved if I buy a car in one state and sell it in another? Anything else I need to know when buying or selling a car?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort?

Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
14417	I had a J1 trainee visa, can I go to Canada and come back with an ESTA?	<p>I'm from Italy and I had a J1 visa for the US for a year and a half. Now it's expired (I'm in the grace period) but I want to stay longer in California to travel a little bit, because this year I did this trainee-ship and I didn't have the possibility to visit all places that I wanted to.</p>  <p>The question is: Can I go to Canada and come back to the US with an ESTA? I'm not subject to the two years rule to go back to Italy? Is it risky after a J1? Do they believe me? How can convince them that I want to travel a little? </p>  <p>Is it easier to do this via Canada than Mexico? My lawyer said yes but I want to be sure.</p> 
27438	Visa J1 and ESTA during grace period	<p>I am a French National and currently working in the US under a J1 visa. This visa will expire in May 30. I intend to leave the US to travel to central America and Mexico, then to reenter the country on June 28 to take my baggage and leave the US on June 30. I know this is a risky situation, as I am not supposed to leave and then reenter the US during my 30 days grace period after the J1 expires. </p>  <p>My question is: would an ESTA solve my case at immigration? Can I apply for an ESTA being in possession of a J1 visa? (It is specified on the ESTA website that you can apply for a new authorization if, "You are currently not in possession of a visitor's visa.") Thank you!</p> 
4598	Canadian visa rules for flight connections	<p>I know that in the US foreigners must have a US visa if they have a connection in the US, even if they fly from a different country to a different country. That is because in the US you have to go through passport control regardless of your final destination.</p>  <p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p>

47607	Visa Refusal: Should we re-apply?	<p>When my brother was widowed 4 years ago I invited him to join us as he has no children. So he applied for a residence visa but it was refused. In the refusal notice they said </p>  <blockquote>   <p>"In your current application you have declared a monthly income from a   pension and a rented property of £xxx.  The tenancy agreement for this   property states an annual rent of £xxxx.  You are currently not living   in this property, but are living in your other property.  Your   application and its supporting documents contain no indication that   you are reliant on your sponsor for financial support.</p>      <p>Your personal bank statement shows a balance of US$xxxx.  Given that   you have assets and the fact that you have savings, an income from a   pension and property rental without the need for financial support   from your sponsor, I am not satisfied that you are financially wholly   or mainly dependent on your relative present and settled in the United   Kingdom.  317 (ii)".</p> </blockquote>  <p>Recently his application for UK visitor's visa's denied. The reason given was </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“Your documents show that you receive £xx a month pension. You also   have a property which has been let. Although your sponsor has stated   she will be paying all your travel costs it's your own and financial   circumstances which need to be taken into account when considering   your application. As the previous refusal notice shows your intention   was to settle in the UK permanently as a dependent of your sister, I   am not satisfied this is no longer your intention in seeking entry   now".</p> </blockquote>  <p>However the officer miscalculated the currency rate completely wrong, by more than a half less. Further, they missed the facts that my brother has savings in bank accounts (over £xx,xxx), income from property let (£xxx per month) and income from freelance work, and that he owns another property and a land. In other words, in 2011 the refusal found that he was not dependent; in 2015 the refusal omits to look at all the financial evidence and assumes that he is dependent. </p>  <p>He honestly doesn't have any desire to settle in this country now, he just wanted to visit us briefly.</p>  <p>According to the new Immigration Rules we can't appeal against the decision, so we don't know what to do. Could you kindly advise us on what to do, please? </p>

19031	Will a train ticket to Singapore be accepted as proof of onward travel to fly one-way into Malaysia?	<p>So I've booked my ticket to start my next big overland trip and I've elected to start in Kuala Lumpur because it's the cheapest place to fly to from Sydney.</p>  <p>I've previously expressed some concerns that flying into KL on a one-way ticket could end in being refused permission to board the plane or to enter the country on arrival:</p>  <ol> <li><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3598/what-happens-if-you-arrive-in-malaysia-with-a-one-way-ticket-but-are-asked-for-p">What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?</a></li> <li><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18615/fly-into-singapore-or-kuala-lumpur-on-one-way-ticket-to-begin-overlanding-trip">Fly into Singapore or Kuala Lumpur on one-way ticket to begin overlanding trip?</a></li> </ol>  <p>Based on advice in those answers my plan is to buy a train ticket from Alor Setar to Hat Yai in Thailand, or perhaps from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore and use that as proof that I'll be leaving Malaysia.</p>  <p>But will this be sufficient?

45278	Is it easy to enter the UK multiple times on the same Business Visitor Visa?	<p>I got a business visitor visa, sponsored by a company, for a 4-5 day visit. The visa was provided for a period of 6 months, with multiple entry possible. </p>  <p>First, what should I carry with me when entering the UK (at LHR)? Will they just take a look at my visa and let me in, or will I have an interview or something? (I haven't seen indication that I should carry documents or anything with me, but I thought I'd ask).</p>  <p>Second, if I want to re-enter the UK in a month or two (not for a business purpose), can I do that on the same visa, since it's multiple entry? Or is the second entry different than the first (i.e. if the first doesn't have an interview, they'll have an interview on the second entry?)</p>

232	How can I protect camera equipment in checked baggage?	<p>While I usually take my camera equipment in a carry-on when I fly (within the US), that's not always an option (small plane where no carry-on other than my purse is allowed, travelling with too much computer/camera equipment to carry it all on, etc.).</p>  <p>Last time I checked my camera equipment, it was put back in the case incorrectly after (I assume) being searched, causing some very serious breakage.  While "that's what insurance is for" certainly applies, having to try to replace a camera on short notice during a trip is an inconvenience I'd rather avoid.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can check something this delicate/valuable without it being destroyed?  If not, can I at least reduce the chance of major damage somehow?</p>  <p><strong>Clarification:</strong><br> I already have a good camera case.  The problem happened when airport personnel couldn't be bothered to put the camera back properly (I assume the case was searched after I checked it) and instead ripped some of the padded dividers out, crammed them into another part of the case, and wedged the camera in the wrong way.  Without any padding to keep it from moving, and wedged against the side of the case as it was, the camera broke during what may have been normal baggage handling during transportation.</p> 
89	How to insure checked luggage?	<p>I know that you are not supposed to put valuables into checked baggage, but in some cases it is necessary. For example if you have large valuable items that do not fit in carry-on or if you have enough valuable items that you can not fit them all in carry-on. </p>  <p>My understanding is that while airlines do accept liability for baggage, they typically exclude valuable items such as electronics, jewelry etc. and the liability dollar limit is quite low. I've also heard they will won't accept liability for loss, damage or delay caused by "security searches." Here for example is American Airlines <a href="http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/baggage/liabilityLimitations.jsp">Baggage Liability Limitations</a>.</p>  <p>Given that it seems that airlines have limited their liability to the extent that they probably won't pay for anything valuable -- or perhaps anything at all if they can blame the "security procedures" -- what is the best insurance to protect yourself? I'm from the USA and interested about insurance for international travel.</p>

46028	How old does a child need to be to sit separately from parents when flying?	<p>I just took a transatlantic Aer Lingus red eye flight with my 4 year old. When checking in the agent gave my child and I seats that were on opposite sides of the plane separated by about 5 rows. When I asked for adjacent seats she told me that the flight was sold out and I should have paid to reserve them in advance. After a little bit of grumbling, she reseated us next to each other. Are there any rules relating to this? Can I really seat a 4 year old next to innocent strangers and let them, and the flight attendants, deal with the resulting tantrum?</p> 
24369	Do both parents need to apply for a US passport for minors?	<p>So, I have a timeshare in Cancun, and I want to take my two children, both underage minors.  Obviously, they are going to need to have passports.  Their mother and I are separated, but not yet divorced, and she's, well, special.  I've offered to bring the ex along, but I suspect she will refuse. </p>  <p>The question is: Can I apply for a passport for the kids, without involving their mother?  Obviously, I intend on telling the mom before we leave the country, but I'm considering just going ahead and applying for the passports before she can come up with some, ahem, justification for why I shouldn't be able to get them their passports.  If nothing else, I'd like to be the one controlling the passports, because if anyone would flee the country with them, it would be her.</p>  <p>What does the law say about just one parent applying for the passports?  And, if I do get them, can she then apply for her own set of passports for the kids?</p>

19241	Can a normal backpacker obtain a multiple-entry Chinese visa while on the road?	<p>I'm an Australian citizen backpacking around Southeast Asia, currently in Bangkok. I would like to criss-cross China several times on this trip to visit some of its neighbouring country by crossing land borders. So I need to apply for a multiple-entry tourist visa for China.</p>  <p>At the time I originally asked this question I had hunted for information on this and finally found <sup>(on a <a href="http://www.visaforchina.org/KUL_EN/visainstruction/256948.shtml" rel="nofollow">page</a> that's now a dead link)</sup> what seem to be extra prerequisites for multiple-entry tourist visas that are not necessary for single entry visas:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>(vii) If applicant can furnish one of the following documents, applicant may apply for multiple-entry L-Visa:<br>   (1) Real estate certificate in China (original and photocopy); or<br>   (2) Notarized kinship or marriage certificate (original and photocopy); or<br>   (3) At least twice China immigration entry records and photocopy.  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Another site user has found <a href="https://visasdirect.com.au/china-visa.php" rel="nofollow">another current page here</a> with a similar list.</p>  <p>I don't even know what some of these things are. Does this mean it's not possible for a backpacker to get a multiple-entry visa? Does anybody have experience with this? Would the fact that I'm not applying in my home country present an extra problem?</p>  <p>If the rules or the actual practice of the application process varies from country to country, is Bangkok a better or worse place to apply, or would I be better off postponing it and applying in another country in Southeast Asia?</p>

35862	Alternative route for the shut down Harwich - Esbjerg ferry route by car	<p>I am planning to have a Scandinavian trip (preferably it would include Copenhagen, Malmö, Gothenburg, maybe also Oslo or the southern parts of Norway) from London by car. As I'll be the only one able to drive I want to try to minimize the amount to drive outside of Scandinavia. The Harwich - Esbjerg ferry route seemed to be perfect, but unfortunately after 29 September <a href="http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk/ferry-routes/harwich-esbjerg-route-closure/" rel="nofollow">it will be shut down</a>. The page only mentions alternative routes that go to Calais first, from which I have to drive all the way through to Denmark (around 1200 km).</p>  <p>Google also suggest taking the Harwich - Hoek van Holland ferry to the Netherlands first, and continue my trip from that. I could gain around 250 kms, which is not much, but still better than going through Calais or Dunkerque.</p>  <p>I was wondering whether I could still decrease the amount to drive, e.g. by taking another ferry from the Netherlands or by using some kind of car transport by train (I don't know whether there are any though).</p>  <p>I've also considered flying to Copenhagen first and then getting a hire car, but we'd probably have a lot of luggage both way that would prohibit the air travel.</p> 
38456	Can I collect post at / near Heathrow airport (on a Saturday)?	<p>This coming weekend, I have a moderate layover in Heathrow airport.

The cost of posting them to where I'm going is rather high, and if sent where I am now they won't arrive in time.</p>  <p>There isn't enough time to get to the office and back, so that's out, and I can't see anyone from work wanting to trek to the wrong side of London to drop them off to me in Heathrow in person!</p>  <p>That leads me to wonder - is there a post office in / near Heathrow airport, which offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poste_restante">Poste restante</a>, and is open on Saturdays? </p>  <p>(If there is, then that ought to allow work to post the papers to said post office, and I can then enter the UK, head to the post office, collect them, then return through security for my onward flight. It'd work out a lot cheaper than the other options I can think of)</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else?

4780	Can I visit Chicago during a 5.5 hour layover in O'Hare?	<p>I will be flying from Boston to Tokyo with a 5.5 hour morning layover in Chicago. I'm thinking of going out to the city for some late breakfast and/or sightseeing. I've never left an airport during a layover before, so I have some questions.</p>  <p>I'll land in Chicago at 8am, and take off at 1:30pm.</p>  <ul> <li>I imagine I'll leave the airport by 9, and should be back by 11:30. Is this reasonable?</li> <li>What's the best way to deal with luggage? I assume that I'll have to claim the luggage from the domestic flight, then re-check it for the international flight. Can I leave the airport after re-checking it? If not, are there any luggage storage options, other than <a href="http://airportczar.com/ohare/about/lockers">Manuel</a> (lol)?</li> <li>How much is a taxi to downtown Chicago?</li> <li>As an alternative to downtown, is there anything (food/sights) you can you recommend that's closer to the airport?</li> </ul> 
31488	Two trips to the USA 3 weeks apart under ESTA scheme	<p>I am a British citizen visiting the USA in early August for a two week vacation with friends. After the holiday I'm returning to my home in the UK for three weeks. After that I will return to the USA and will be working for my British employer under the Visa Waiver Program for a period of 80-85 days.</p>  <p>I have read already that there is technically no problems with this under ESTA rules, but should I limit this working period to a shorter time frame (e.g. 70 or so days) so that it does not negatively affect the decision made by the POE officer? Ideally I would love to be over in the states for the near-full 85 day period.</p>  <p>Any advice or previous experiences anyone can offer?</p>  <p>Some clarifications: As confirmed by the immigration attorney, as I am employed by my UK employer, it will be regarded as a business trip, the important part being that I will be working officially as a consultant for my UK employer just overseas for the allotted 85 or so days</p>

For off peak ones, you take any other off peak train, or any train if they're feeling kind and waive the time restrictions.</p>  <p>However, Advanced Purchase tickets are valid only on the specific booked train, which is specified on the ticket, and aren't refundable or cancellable. What happens then if the train your Advanced Purchase ticket specifies you must travel on is cancelled?</p>

Price is a secondary concern. </p> 
48141	What's the best way to get from the Paddington Station to these London museums?	<p>Suppose you're starting from off somewhere near the Paddington Station (which is where I find myself at the current moment). From here on, you can either rely on the underground trains, buses or plain ole' walking (taxis being freaking expensive). Out of these options, which one would be the most optimal for visiting:</p>  <ol> <li>British Museum</li> <li>Natural History Museum</li> <li>V&amp;A</li> <li>Science Museum</li> <li>Tate Modern</li> </ol>  <p>It would be extremely helpful, if the answer would describe in as much as detail as possible the routes that one must take alternatively to reach the above-listed locations. All of it must be done in a span of 1-2 days and thus be maximally efficient.</p>  <p>(I'm a total newbie to the city and need a (virtual) guiding hand of the travel.stackexchange veterans/any London 'pundits'!)</p>

45278	Is it easy to enter the UK multiple times on the same Business Visitor Visa?	<p>I got a business visitor visa, sponsored by a company, for a 4-5 day visit. The visa was provided for a period of 6 months, with multiple entry possible. </p>  <p>First, what should I carry with me when entering the UK (at LHR)? Will they just take a look at my visa and let me in, or will I have an interview or something? (I haven't seen indication that I should carry documents or anything with me, but I thought I'd ask).</p>  <p>Second, if I want to re-enter the UK in a month or two (not for a business purpose), can I do that on the same visa, since it's multiple entry? Or is the second entry different than the first (i.e. if the first doesn't have an interview, they'll have an interview on the second entry?)</p>

776	Long Term Travel - what insurances can / should I get?	<p>I'm a freelancer in the field of software development and I'm planning to travel to different places, but also continue working. I'd expect to stay at a certain place (country) for 1-3 months. Pretty much living a nomadic life for a while.</p>  <p>What I'm wondering now, is, what type of insurance should I get and also what can I get, to be covered internationally. I guess the most important one is health insurance.</p>  <p>Not sure if that is important at all, but maybe I should mention that I'm a German citizen. However, I haven't lived in Germany for 4 years. Until now I've always lived in different countries, but for at least a year, and thus could get local insurances. However, if I would only stay in a country for 1-3 months I guess there is too much bureaucratic overhead to get local insurances.</p>

It does impact a traveler's visit whether one likes it or not, as pointed out in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/48242/what-are-the-restrictions-imposed-by-the-sharia-law-in-aceh-sumatra">What are the restrictions imposed by the Sharia law in Aceh, Sumatra?</a></p>  <p>The Ramadan last for about one month every year, &amp; this is a highly spiritual time for Muslims all around the world. There is already a question regarding the Indonesia as a whole &amp; its impact on a visitor <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/42874/how-much-is-a-traveler-affected-by-ramadan-in-indonesia">How much is a traveler affected by Ramadan in Indonesia?</a></p>  <p>I suppose that the Aceh province does get even stricter than it already is the rest of year.

10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
6158	Should I carry a passport around everywhere I go in the UK?	<p>I am a new student in the UK. I attend classes both in London and Cambridge. Should I carry my passport with me wherever I go within UK? Or is a college identity enough?</p>  <p>My parents are visiting me soon. Should I ensure they carry their passports when we go out somewhere in London on a picnic? </p> 
24003	Is it safe and legal to sleep in my car in California (L.A. area)?	<p>I will be visiting California and some parts of the US West Coast in the coming September. I'd like to rent a car for travelling, and to reduce travel expenses I would like to sleep in it some nights. I've already done it on a past trip to Iceland and I'm accustomed to it.</p>  <ul> <li>Is it legal to sleep in the car during the night in California and USA in general?</li> <li>Is is generally safe to sleep in the car during the night?  I'll be traveling around LA and San Francisco.</li> </ul>  <p>I'm an Italian citizen and never been to USA before, if that matters.</p> 
13445	Can I get arrested for loitering?	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering">Loitering</a> seems to have incredibly vague definition, according to Wikipedia. It seems that it's illegal, even if you don't seem to be doing anything wrong. In the US, there are signs to this effect, which came to a surprise to me. Can I actually get into trouble if I, well, loiter, whatever loose definition you use?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gFwhf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><sup>Photo is from personal archive.</sup></p> 
13867	Can I cross the USA-Canada border with a birth certificate and a passport locator number?	<p>My US passport took too long to be shipped to me, and it will arrive after I need to leave. Will I be able to cross the border from the United States to Canada with a birth certificate (copy) and a passport locator number?</p> 
35320	Why does TSA security vary so much for different airports?	<p>I would assume TSA (Transportation Security Administration) security to be especially tight no matter the airport, but it seems that the different airports I have been to have often very different policies.</p>  <p>For example, I went to OAK (Oakland International), but security was very very lax. For example, shoes stayed on the entire time, electronics did not need to be taken out of the backpacks, belts and wallets did not need to come out. No full body scanners were in place, only metal detectors and the usual bag screening.</p>  <p>However, IAD (Washington Dulles) and SFO (San Franciso International) were much more stringent, requiring full body scanners, shoes and metal objects going in containers, etc.</p>  <p>Is there a reason that these security protocols vary so widely in different airports?</p>  <p>To note, I flew domestic on each flight. This "data" was comprised out of 3 trips leaving from OAK, then flying back.  Security protocols remained the same flying</p> 
17122	Which visa will I be entering under?	<p>There was a question about entry into the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10735/multiple-us-visas">US on still valid tourist visa with a still valid F visa</a>.</p>  <p>Now this begs a different question: </p>  <p>If I am a citizen of some country that requires a visa to enter the Schengen area and I have a valid Multiple Entry Short stay visa, which is still valid, and on top of that I have a long stay visa as well for one of the members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" rel="nofollow">Schengen Agreement</a> (let's say for argument sake: Germany).</p>  <p>What will happen when I arrive in France for a connecting flight?  Will long stay visa take precedence?  Or will I enter as a tourist and have to do something special to make sure that I won't be in violation of the 90 day rule when I leave through France 5 months later?</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
42106	Is 45 mins enough in Newark airport terminal C to change the plane for connecting flight?	<p>My flight will arrive Newark at 19:49 Terminal C and my connectiong internation flight will start at 20:35 Terminal C. There is no change in terminal, I just have to change the plane. Is this enough to manage? I am worried because layover is just 45 mins.</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
29158	Sim Card in Canada & US	<p>I'm traveling next week to Montreal, Canada for 2 weeks and then for another week to New York. I want to buy a sim card for my smartphone in Montreal that will also work in New York.</p>  <p>The main purpose of the phone will be calls (not a lot) and maybe some text messages, no Internet needed. Of course I'm looking to buy the sim card wherever it is cheaper. Could you tell me which cell phone provider in Canada is the best solution for me?</p>

4780	Can I visit Chicago during a 5.5 hour layover in O'Hare?	<p>I will be flying from Boston to Tokyo with a 5.5 hour morning layover in Chicago. I'm thinking of going out to the city for some late breakfast and/or sightseeing. I've never left an airport during a layover before, so I have some questions.</p>  <p>I'll land in Chicago at 8am, and take off at 1:30pm.</p>  <ul> <li>I imagine I'll leave the airport by 9, and should be back by 11:30. Is this reasonable?</li> <li>What's the best way to deal with luggage? I assume that I'll have to claim the luggage from the domestic flight, then re-check it for the international flight. Can I leave the airport after re-checking it? If not, are there any luggage storage options, other than <a href="http://airportczar.com/ohare/about/lockers">Manuel</a> (lol)?</li> <li>How much is a taxi to downtown Chicago?</li> <li>As an alternative to downtown, is there anything (food/sights) you can you recommend that's closer to the airport?</li> </ul> 
48344	Should I leave cash tips for housekeeping each day of a multi-day stay?	<p>This seems like a bit of a trivial question, but: when staying in a hotel for multiple nights in a row in a location where tipping the housekeeping staff is customary, is it better to leave cash tips for housekeeping every day that the room is kept, or just to leave a single cash tip for the whole stay at checkout?</p>  <p>I would think it likely that different housekeeping crews work different days (especially, e.g., weekends versus weekdays), and it only seems fair to try to ensure that everyone who has worked on the room gets a part of the tips.  But, if it's typical, say, that housekeeping staffs pool the cash tips and distribute them more-or-less evenly, then it's not really worth the trouble of leaving tips daily.</p> 
47787	Is it safe to roller-skate on sidewalks in USA?	<p>I love roller-skating, I carry them around on all my travels. I will be spending 6 months in USA (evenly between Chicago, New York, San Francisco, LA and Salt Lake City). </p>  <p>I was wondering if it is safe (or not frowned-upon) to skate on sidewalks in these cities?</p>  <p>Of course, I won't be zooming past pedestrians or anything. I just like following the rhythm of the pedestrians; but on my skates. </p> 
44935	What do I need to know about traveling to Dubai during Ramadan?	<p>I bought tickets to Dubai for the summer for a small vacation (first week of July). Unfortunately, I did not realize it was during Ramadan. I have been told by a few acquaintances that the laws in Dubai are especially strict during Ramadan and you can even receive citations for drinking water (given that it's almost the hottest month of the year, this seems miserable). Additionally, I have heard that many places are closed (such as bars/clubs) and there is far less to do in the city. </p>  <p>I will be traveling with my girlfriend. We were told by one of her friends in Dubai that she does not feel comfortable letting us stay with her because we are unmarried and she could be fined or get into legal trouble if she housed us.</p>  <p>I am not Muslim and do not follow any Muslim traditions/customs. Are any of these things true and would they apply to me as a foreigner? Is there any other useful information an ignorant American like me should know about the city during Ramadan with regards to the customs during that time? I would like to be as respectful as possible but I'd still like to have a good time in the city (or even neighboring cities).</p>

30451	Is 2h 45m enough for a layover in EWR transferring from an int'l to a domestic flight (Terminal B → Terminal C)?	<p>I am arriving from Frankfurt(FRA) to Newark(EWR) and I must pass the Customs and Border Control before catching the next flight to Baltimore (BWI). Both flight are on the same ticket by United Airlines (UA51 and UA4775)</p>  <ol> <li>Is 2 hours and 45 minutes enough time to catch the next plane, or do I have to expect longer waiting times and should go for a different route?</li> <li>I'll be traveling before the AirTrain starts operating. What is the best way to get from Terminal B to C? </li> <li>I have heard that there is a transfer shuttle bus that connects the terminals such that you don't need to leave security area. What is the schedule for this bus?</li> <li>I'm not sure about the procedure for arriving from abroad. As far as I understood, I'll need to: <ul> <li>Collect my check-in luggage </li> <li>Pass border control and customs (Immigration)</li> <li>Transfer from Terminal B to C</li> <li>Check my luggage into Domestic Flight</li> <li>Go through Security Check</li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Is there a way to optimize this procedure to save time? Can I re-check my luggage in terminal B?</p>  <p>What are my options if I miss the connection? Just go to the UA counter and ask to reserve the next possible flight?</p> 
31394	Transit visa rules in Dubai airport	<p>My uncle is traveling from Dubai to Amsterdam and then to Quito. He is citizen of Ecuador and Pakistan, currently in Pakistan.

3220	Why would you wrap your luggage in plastic?	<p>At many airports you can wrap your luggage with sheets of sticky plastic. Why on earth would you do that? I only see disadvantages. I can imagine the mess when customs ask you to open your luggage. So what benefits am I missing?</p>  <hr>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cutey5/4287598646/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4287598646_4a59f0b628.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Wrapping luggage in plastic at JFK airport, USA"></p>  <p>Photo by Reuben Strayer, license: CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></p> 
39649	US Citizen: 90/180 Schengen Stay & Bilateral Agreements w/Poland, Denmark, etc	<p>I'm a US citizen on an extended trip in Europe. So far, I've been very careful with the 90/180 rule. At no point in any 180 days have I stayed more than 90 days in the Schengen area; my "gap months" were spent in the UK and Croatia.</p>  <p>The end of another 90-day period is upon me, and I was planning to take a trip to Ireland. However, I recently learned that a few countries — Denmark, Poland, maybe France — might possibly have bilateral agreements with the US that let you stay 90 days passport-free, independent of any other Schengen area visits.</p>  <p>This is very appealing to me, since I really wanted to visit Poland and/or Denmark anyway. I'd much rather go to those countries than Ireland. However, the information about these agreements is <em>extremely sketchy</em>, at best. For the most part, it's people on travel forums quoting snippets of law and talking about how they weren't caught when they crossed the border. If a border guard confronts me, I do not, under any circumstance, want to run into a situation where I can get banned from the Eurozone!</p>  <p>On the other hand, the New to Denmark website (billed as "the official portal for foreigners") <a href="http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/visa/Visa_free_travel.htm" rel="nofollow">quite clearly states</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Citizens of Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, New   Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the US can freely enter and stay   in Denmark for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, regardless of   whether they have stayed in another Schengen country prior to entry   into Denmark. The 90 days are counted from the entry date into Denmark   or another Nordic country. If you have previously spent time in   Denmark or another Nordic country within the previous 180 days, that   time will be deducted from the 90-day maximum.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I guess my questions are as follows:</p>  <ol> <li>Are these rumors of bilateral agreements independent of the Schengen passport-free period true? Or has it just been instances of border guards being nice?</li> <li>Is the quoted statement above an official document that I can use as a reference?</li> <li>Does a similar statement exist somewhere for Poland (or France, if valid)?</li> <li>Why does the statement mention "another Nordic country"? Is this bilateral agreement with just Denmark, or does it include other Nordic countries as well?</li> <li>If I follow through with this and decide to go to one of these countries, how can I get official verification of the additional 90-day period? The Schengen area doesn't have border checks, after all; there won't be any official proof that I entered Denmark/Poland/France on a certain date.</li> <li>Do I have to do something to "activate" this extended stay?</li> <li>Does the 90-day Schengen period get put on hold while I'm in one of these bilateral countries, or is it still active? That is, if I spend 90 days in Schengen and then another 90 days in Poland, am I free to go back to Schengen for another 90 days? Or does the Schengen clock stop while I'm in Poland?</li> </ol>  <p>To clarify, I'm not looking to make a "border run", but to stay in one of these countries for a few months.</p> 
42081	Visa for gap year in Europe	<p>I am going to Europe in 2016 for a year for my gap year-I will be 18 and am from Australia. </p>  <p>My dream is to backpack for about 6 months, and au pair for about 3 months, yet this is extremely difficult with the Schengen Visa. </p>  <p>I was just wondering, if I obtained a Working Holiday Visa for Germany (au-pairing or possibly having a job assisting a photographer), and I only worked for 3-4 months; would the Working Holiday Visa allow me to travel around the Schengen area for the remaining year? </p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p>

38204	How to register Russian tourist visa while on the Trans-Mongolian railway?	<p>My partner and I will be starting our Trans-Mongolian adventure in about a week or so, but after reading the visa registration procedures from various resources, we're still a little confused about some of the details for our trip.</p>  <p>Basically, we'll be travelling from east to west. More specifically: our journey starts in Beijing, after which we'll hit Ulan-Bator in Mongolia for a few days, and our first stop in Russia will be Ulan Ude. From there, we'll be making our way towards Moscow over the period of 2-2.5 weeks.</p>  <p>Our main uncertainty is how to deal with registering our tourist visa along the way, from Ulan-Ude to Moscow (once we're in Moscow, we'll be staying at the same accommodation for a week, and close to another week after that in St. Petersburg, so we're confident our ho(s)tels will be able to help us out there). </p>  <p>Between Ulan-Ude and Moscow, we'll only be staying for one or two nights at a place at a time. That is, we'll get off the train, stay for one or two nights, and continue onwards west by train after that.</p>  <p>Our two main questions:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Is it fair to assume all hotels and hostels in Ulan-Ude offer a visa registration service? As far as we understand the process, we'll definitely have to register our visa within 7 days (not counting weekends and public holidays) of entering the country, regardless of how long we're staying at one location. Ulan-Ude seems to be our best option/most logical choice, but if not, what alternatives do we have? We were informed that sometimes the local UFMS or post office requires you to present a formal letter of invitation to register a visa - we don't have one, and honestly, it's sounds like a painful and time-consuming process if we were to have to do this at every stop...</p></li> <li><p>After Ulan-Ude, can we expect visa registration services from ho(s)tels in cities like Krosnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, Perm and Vladimir? Should we even bother registering if we're only staying for one or two nights at every stop, or could we cherry-pick one or two cities where registering is 'easy' (while making sure we don't exceed the 7-day period between every subsequent registration)?</p></li> </ul>  <p>We're sure we're in a pretty common situation, and we're probably worrying too much about this stuff, but for whatever reason we found little to no documentation on the appropriate course of action for this scenario. Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>  <hr>  <p>PS: We're doing this trip independently. There's no travel agency or so involved, but of course we did get our support documents through a licensed tourist agency based in Russia (based on which we were both granted a 30-day tourist visa).</p> 
17438	How to independently visit Saudi Arabia?	<p>I've read that Saudi Arabia doesn't grant tourist visas to independent travelers.

10399	How to calculate stays against 90/180 visa rules?	<p>Some destinations have a "90/180 rule" which says you can come and go but you must not spend over 90 days out of any 180 days in the area. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">A recent question asked by a new contributor</a> concerns this rule.</p>  <p>At least Schengen and Turkey have this rule, probably depending on where the traveller is from and what kind of visa they apply for.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm a dummy but I've always had a lot of trouble trying to add up how many days I've spent in such places when I've entered and left several times over recent months.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to do this I'm missing or is it difficult for everybody? I'm guessing something based on counting backwards from the end date might be the trick?</p>  <p>Maybe you know of an app or website that can do this for you.</p> 
48109	Netherlands Schengen Visa - Spain	<p>I received a Schengen Visa from Netherlands Embassy and it is valid for one year.

46111	Ridiculous and unreasonable taxes for used electronic devices in europe	<p>I'm a German national, and I have lived for the past 2 years in France. Like many people, I travel with my iPad, phone and MacBook; each of these items are over one and a half years old, bought in USA, and I have travelled more than 7 times around the world with them. </p>  <p>Recently I travelled to Mexico for vacation (my parents live there). During my layover in Germany I was forced me to pay 500 euros worth of taxes and insurances because I didn't declare them. I have never heard of this before, surely it is completely absurd since these items are already used and old! This is completely wrong, right? Is there any way I can complain and get my money back or report this?</p> 
43590	Can I converse with Japanese travellers on the Shinkansen or is it rude?	<p>I'm planning to travel from Osaka to Tokyo and back, and since the ride will be long, I think it's the perfect time to make friends.</p>  <p>However, I'm unsure how the Japanese see this kind of behaviour - a stranger suddenly conversing with them who is a foreigner.</p>  <p>Is it considered rude? Is it a case-to-case basis?</p>  <hr>  <p>Additional info :</p>  <p>I can speak Japanese. I've been studying it for a year. I am at a conversational level but still not as good as locals and I may not know some words they might throw at me.</p> 
2310	Which countries, if any, offer on-arrival work visas?	<p>After seeing <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2287/108">this question</a> I began wondering - are there countries that say, Aussies or Kiwis (or anyone else) can get a work visa on arrival, or while in the country?</p>  <p>The best I've found is this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html">http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/whvchart.html</a></p>  <p>which indicates availability of working holiday programs, but for several of them (Argentina for example) you are required to apply to Wellington (in my case) before being accepted.</p>  <p>Chile, on the other hand, you can't get one on arrival, but you can apply for one while being a tourist in the country.</p>  <p>So a chart or definitive source of countries where you can basically wander in and start working (legally) would be the ideal answer for this :D</p> 
45092	Where can I travel for prolonged periods of time while legally working remotely for a company in my home country?	<p>I found several questions about inbound travelers to the US in this scenario, but little about other countries: I work for a company in my home country (USA) who are open to me working remotely while traveling. </p>  <p>Which countries allow me to legally work remotely for a company in my home country (USA) while traveling in their country? The work has absolutely no connection to the destination country, it would take place identically entirely within the USA if I weren't traveling.</p>

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
48669	Is it legal to sleep in a parked car on the streets of Munich?	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest" rel="nofollow">Oktoberfest</a> is the world's largest beer festival held annually in Munich, Germany. Being the largest beer festival means accommodation during the festival is either super-expensive or hard to book within a short notice. <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/48719/public-shower-options-in-munich">Showers</a>,  <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/48759/breakfast-places-in-munich-that-open-at-6am-or-earlier-on-the-weekends">breakfast</a>, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/48783/what-kind-of-food-is-served-inside-the-oktoberfest-tents-and-at-what-price">lunch</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/48724/how-early-should-i-get-to-the-oktoberfest-tents-to-get-in-without-a-reservation">beer</a> are available without reservation, so a place to sleep is the only problem.</p>  <p>My friend has a small minivan which is convenient enough for sleeping. Would it be legal to find a quiet parking space somewhere (relatively) close to Oktoberfest and just sleep in the van? Bonus points for recommending a good spot to park in that area.</p> 
47786	Indian passport with two missing (ripped out) pages - should I get a new one to enter the US?	<p>I have got a passport in very good condition with two inner pages totally ripped out (they are missing).

43168	How can I do an online broad search for cruise trips?	<p>I like to travel in cruise ships, but for me it's usually hard to decide on an itinerary. I've never found a web site that allows me to compare cruise trips, so I have to search in many cruise companies (<a href="http://www.costacruise.com/" rel="nofollow">Costa</a>, <a href="http://www.msccruises.com/" rel="nofollow">MSC</a>, <a href="http://www.royalcaribbean.com/" rel="nofollow">Royal Caribbean</a>...) and compare their fares and itineraries.</p>  <p>It seems to me that cruise planning is not as advanced as flying. Last time I took a Costa cruise (it was a little over 1 year ago) I couldn't buy it online! I had to go to a travel agent and buy through it. Even though, I suspect there should be a website to help those that want to cruise, but I'm just not aware of.</p>  <p>Specifically, I'm looking for a tool like <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/" rel="nofollow">Skyscanner</a>, <a href="http://adioso.com/" rel="nofollow">Adioso</a>, <a href="http://www.kayak.com/" rel="nofollow">Kayak</a> (and the like), that would allow me to enter a date (or a date range) and places (perhaps a country or a region) and search for cruise ships that would be in those places within the date range supplied.</p> 
5408	Why is a nonstop flight sometimes more expensive than multiple connections?	<p>Usually I find a flight I like that uses one or more connections with the same or different companies. In these cases, if the distance between the first and the second connection is not too large, I prefer to go by bus or train and then take the flight. The problem is that sometimes it is more expensive to take the flight in the second airport than to take the flight from the first one. I mean, I'm wondering why sometimes it is more expensive to take only a flight than to take the same flight and another one.</p>  <p>A practical example (and real, you can check with SkyScanner). Imagine I am in Madrid (Spain) and would like to go to Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) on April 1st. The cheapest flight I have found is this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TAM airlines: MAD -> GRU -> GIG : 507 €</p> </blockquote>  <p>Fantastic! GRU is one of São Paulo's airports. That's perfect for me! I'll go on to Rio traveling overland. But then, I look for this flight (MAD -> GRU, non-stop):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TAM airlines: MAD -> GRU : 597 €</p> </blockquote>  <p>It's the same flight, 90 € more expensive! I've found this kind of behavior a lot of times and I'm intrigued to know why it happens.</p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey. He booked <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> and <em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>.<br> Somehow he needed to be earlier at location <em>B</em>, so he took a train and did not take the flight from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.</p>  <p>When he went to the airport to take the "back home" flight (<em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>), he was informed that his ticket was canceled because he did not take the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> flight. They canceled the ticket and sold it to someone else.</p>  <p>Is this normal? The company said it was their right to do so, and he could not get the flight back.<br> The company was Iberia.</p> 
18384	How to extend my short stay visa in Spain?	<p>I hold a China main-land passport.  I am doing study abroad from the US to France and Spain.

Is it possible for me to extend my stay in Spain? </p> 
26794	Is it possible to extend my 90-day short stay in Sweden by 10 or 15 days?	<p>I am a Canadian Citizen, visiting Sweden for 90 days without a visa. Is it possible to extend by just 15 days? If so, please provide information as to where I can find out how much it would cost and how to do so if you can.</p>  <p>The reason being, all the flights before the 91 day mark are about 200+ dollars more than after that date.</p> 
10590	Lost passport with Schengen visa	<p>My passport was stolen in Prague on my way to Vienna. I filed a police report and our embassy swiftly acted by giving me a temporary passport for my onward journey to Munich and Rome. Upon exit from Rome, the immigration ask for the Schengen visa, when I told him that I lost my passport, he did not ask for any document to support my claim, he just stamped my new passport with exit. I am not sure if on record, I am officially out of the Schengen area or not. I am scared that without the lost visa, it appears that I am still in the area and might reach the 90 day limit and will be denied when I re-apply as it would appear I broke the rule. What to do?</p> 
45960	Amsterdam To Rotterdam	<p>I will be going from Amsterdam to Rotterdam this summer, by train, as it seemed the most feasible. Precisely, 20 July. I am not living in Netherlands, so buying the ticket from the office right now is not an option. If I buy the ticket online, the ticket sending and reservation fee cost too much. My question is, would it be possible for me to buy a ticket two days before the departure time in Netherlands, from the office? Or do those trains run out of tickets really fast?</p>  <p>Thank you for your attention</p>

48724	How early should I get to the Oktoberfest tents to get in without a reservation?	<p>Oktoberfest tents are super-crowded and it's recommended that people arrive early.

19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
18894	What is an International Driver's License?	<p>I have never understood the difference between international and non-international driver's licenses. Are some countries issuing non-international driver's licenses? I always assumed that if I have a driver's license from one country, it only depends on agreements whether I can drive with that license in another country. </p>  <p>What is the procedural difference between getting international and non-international one, for example in Germany/EU?</p> 
441	Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?	<p>When I first started travelling internationally about 20 years ago I was young and naive and bought an international driver's license for my trip to the United States.</p>  <p>Then I discovered that it was not at all needed. All that was needed was a licence from my own country with a photo. At that time photo licences were relatively new in Australia.</p>  <p>So my question is, is this the case everywhere or are there some countries which really do not permit foreigners to drive without an international licence?</p>  <p>(I don't need a full list of countries as an answer, just a yes or no with a couple of examples is fine)</p>

11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations?

38487	UK Family Visa Refused, how long till I reapply?	<p>I applied for a family visa on 19th October 2014 and today (10 November.'14) I got the refusal letter.

Was that a reason of my refusal?</p>  <p>As I have been retired from Government service in 2007, I didn't provide any bank-statement in my name. But I DID submit the 'Certificate of FDr (Fixed Deposit)'[as mentioned in list_item# 6] of my pension amount and corresponding monthly interest from it which they completely ignored and stated as "have not provided any other evidence of stated monthly income".</p>  <p>Besides, they also mentioned about the absence of evidence of my living circumstances here in Bangladesh although I have provided the ownership documents of my OWN apartment. Wasn't that enough to make them convince that I live in my own apartment right now?</p>  <p>Moreover, I have another fixed deposit on '6-months interest' payment-basis. Probably that was a mistake from my side that I only provided the receipt of accessing it on 2008 but not afterwards.I assume that was one of the reasons.</p>  <p>Finally, the refusal letter mentioned their doubt about my previous stay in the UK back in 1975. I studied and worked there for 6 and a half years which I mentioned in my form but unfortunately couldn't manage any supporting documents against it. What sort of document was I supposed to submit?</p>  <p>So, that was the details of the scenario now. What should I do in this case? Can I reapply right now? Or ask for an administrative review?</p> 
36755	UK Visa Refused - Can I reapply immediately?	<p>I applied for the UK tourism visa.</p>  <p>I mentioned that I was going to travel only for 2 weeks. However I got rejected because I didn't mention in the application, that I was working, nor mentioned that my dad has a job also.</p>  <p>Although I gave them my dad's bank statement, they were worried that I might go to the UK and not come back, because I might not have enough funds to return to Egypt which is not true.</p>  <p>My mum wrote my application and she didn't know that she was supposed to put my dad's job or mine as well, or whether I stayed with my family or alone. I suspect that's the reason why the visa application got rejected.</p>  <p>I want to apply again for the visa because I want to visit my cousin - she lives there, plus I need to go on a vacation. I want to know whether it's possible for me to apply again for the visa now, or do I have to wait for another six months to reapply?</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else? Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p>

17053	Issues with US immigration after alleged overstay - how to handle?	<p>I arrived in Miami International Airport (Feb 2013) and was taken aside by immigration who stated I had overstayed in the US in 1995 by a few days. It was claimed that I had not left the US and they wanted to know where I had been in the US for 18 years!  </p>  <p>They said they had no record of me leaving or if I did I had overstayed (which I know I had not). I have since found in an old passport a stamp from US immigration that shows I reentered the US in May of 1995 from Canada (again on holiday).  </p>  <p>After he agreed to let me in for my vacation I was advised that I would have to go through the same four hour questioning process every time I visit the US again. </p>  <p>When I left the US two weeks later my partner and I were told by the airline staff that we had to be separated for our return journey. No reason given other than it was a request from US officials. Why was this? I have no convictions and am a frequent traveler to holiday destinations.</p>  <p>Was I tagged?  Will this happen again? How can I get answers? The whole experience was so horrific and unpleasant and clearly unnecessary that I am reluctant to visit again. What can I do? Can I get pre-clearance? Any suggestions please.</p>

11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year.

38531	Entering the USA by land border	<p>I'll do a two week trip from Europe to Toronto and will fly back from New York. I plan to enter the US at Niagara Falls using a Greyhound bus (or Amtrak train alternatively). I meet all requirements for the Visa Waiver Program and had no problems entering the US a couple of years ago (under ESTA by air). However on the homepage of my American consulate, it says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>To qualify for the VWP, travelers from participating countries must:</p>      <p>If arriving by a land border, have proof of financial solvency and a   domicile abroad;</p> </blockquote>  <p>What exactly does this mean? How do I have to prove that. Is there anything I can prepare beforehand and which documents/forms are needed besides my passport?</p> 
40523	Celebrating the same new year several times over?	<p>Is there a commercial service offered to general public that allows you to celebrate the new year several times?  The idea is that you would celebrate it in a time-zone and than move to the next one arriving there before new year. Of course this is relatively easy to accomplish by yourself if you're near the border of a country and you just move to the next one in a different time zone. Things probably get a bit more complex to do it 3 or more times.</p>

730	How can I do a "broad" search for flights?	<p>Several airline and trip planning sites will allow you to check "I am flexible with my dates" or a similar option.  Is there any way to also search more broadly for location?</p>  <p>For example, if you wanted to leave from YYZ or YKF and arrive at any airport in California, can a search for such flights be done somehow?</p>  <p>I ask because when I plan plane trips, I want the lowest price.  I'm OK with leaving a day or two later if I save $200 (same with the return trip).  There are 3 airports within 80 km of me, I'll leave from the one with the cheapest flight. And I'm also OK with changing the trip to spend time exploring San Francisco instead of lying on the beach near San Diego, and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>Normally this would take dozens of searches, but I'd like to see it all at once.</p>

39435	Staying in Europe (Schengen and non-Schengen) for one year	<p>I am an Indonesian passport holder.

I will then fly back to the Netherlands on 1 July 2015 until 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>My aim is to stay in Europe for one whole year in 2015:</p>  <ol> <li>90 days in the Netherlands (January, February and March)</li> <li>90 days in either Romania or Croatia (April, May and June)</li> <li>90 days in the Netherlands again (July, August and September)</li> <li>90 days in either Serbia or Bulgaria (October, November and December)</li> </ol>

46129	Does Schengen visa proof of transport requirement include travel inside Europe?	<p>The Schengen checklist for short stay when applying from South Africa via France includes this (emphasis mine):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"All transfers (flight/ferry/train/bus/taxi) showing entry &amp; exit from   France <em>and between other countries</em> must be provided. Name of   applicant must appear on all proof of transport."</p> </blockquote>  <p>My flights are booked, I have proof of arrival from my country and a long series of flights to leave the schengen area and return home. There is a ferry into France and a flight from Berlin to Dublin (outside Schengen).</p>  <p>However, I prefer not to book some of my transport inside Europe because many train and bus systems do not allow me to book more than 90 days in advance (I am in the schengen area for 82 days). Is this something the visa people are likely to be difficult about, given that movement once one is inside the Schengen area is not supposed to be important?</p> 
8933	Can I have multiple Schengen visas for future travels in my passport?	<p>I'm a citizen of Ukraine planning on visiting Italy early in October for tourism. Later that month I'm accepted as a speaker at the conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Both countries are members of Schengen agreement and a visa is required for me to visit them. Therefore, I need to visit Schengen countries 2 times and I need to get my visas ASAP (to confirm my talk to the conference organizers, as well as to avoid overpaying for hotels/flight tickets). </p>  <p>I've heard a number of times that a single person can't apply for a Schengen visa if already in possession of one, but I'd like to clarify this. Say, I've got a visa from Italy for the period of October 1st - October 14th. Can I get another one from Czech Republic for October 25th - October 30th before I visit Italy? Would the answer be different if I were to visit the second country (CZ) on October 13th - October 20th, thus, having a single day overlap between these visits. It would be of a tremendous help if you could link to the official documents that prove your point, but I'd certainly appreciate answers even without such links.</p>  <p>Both times I'm going to apply for a short-term tourist visa covering the dates of my travel. If the answer to both questions above is no - would several visits to multiple Schengen countries over a short period of time be a valid reason to apply for a single multiple-entry visa that covers the whole period from October 1st to October 30th from Italy?</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p>

43660	Traveling in Europe Solo - 18 years old. Feasible?	<p>My dream is to spend a month in Europe after graduating high school.  Based on my situation, I will have to travel alone since there is no one else here who would be able to make such a trip.  I am an Eagle Scout, have common sense, and am used to being independent.  My mom is worried that I will be in danger from thieves, muggers, or other unforeseen obstacles.  I plan on visiting the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, and Germany.  Communication should not be a problem since I speak French fluently and will speak Italian and German fairly well.</p>  <p>Here's my question: Will I be relatively safe traveling in Europe on my own for a month?  What dangers or obstacles in particular should I watch out for - are thieves, pickpockets, or muggers common in some areas?  Given that I have a limited budget of ~$3000, would I have enough to purchase basic necessities such as food, train tickets, and hostel rentals for a month?  What else, in particular, should I be aware of as an 18 year old traveling alone for the first time?</p> 
17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p>

37998	How safe are the ferries in Indonesia?	<p>I'm planning a holiday to Indonesia and want to visit multiple islands. I had thought to take ferries between the different islands. However, a lot of people have told me bad things about the ferries in Indonesia, including:</p>  <p>(a) The ferries have far too many people packed onto them, well above the limit imposed for health &amp; safety reasons</p>  <p>(b) The ferries are not seaworthy and therefore likely to be involved in a tragic accident</p>  <p>(c) The ferries will give you a rough crossing to the point of making you ill</p>  <p>Basically, I just want to know if the situation is really this bad. For example, are there safety records of Indonesian ferries to give an objective view of the situation?</p>  <p>To be more objective, some pointer questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Are these things really true, or just people complaining without good reason?</li> <li>What kind of things can go wrong if the ferry operators put more people on than the limit?</li> <li>How frequently do accidents really happen on ferry routes compared to how many ferry crossings there are in a year? For example, is it significantly more likely to be killed in an Indonesian shipping accident than in a plane accident?</li> <li>What are the other ways of travelling between Indonesian islands and the benefits/disadvantages of each? Flying is an obvious one, but is this really practical (in order to reach typical tourist destinations quickly enough to fit into, say, a 10-day long holiday) and does it have any similar safety risks associated with local carriers?</li> </ol> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen).

Ideally this should give me the answer for all nationalities, and take into account any other visas I may have.</p> 
13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
11114	Can I visit Schengen countries on a long term French Visa?	<p>I have requested for a French long term student visa from India. It's a national visa and not a Schengen visa. My question is that can we still go to other Schengen countries on this visa? If not then can we get a Schengen visa from the Indian embassy in France?</p> 
48760	German national visa (Type D), but entry through another Schengen country?	<p><em>Disclaimer: This might be a duplicate post, but while looking up this question I did not find a response that would put my mind to peace</em> </p>  <p>Hi, I am an Indian student studying in Berlin just for fall semester. I was wondering if I can enter through The Netherlands (Amsterdam) a week <strong>before</strong> my course begins in Berlin on a <em>German National Visa- type D</em>? </p>  <p>Will the National visa (Type D) visa restrict me to enter Germany first? I know I can travel to other Schengen countries using my visa, but I am just fretting I will be rejected entry through Amsterdam and I have already booked my flights</p> 
11250	Getting a tourist Schengen visa after working visa	<p>Here's my situation. I am currently in France on an internship visa (different than a business and tourist visa) which ends next month. I'm interested in doing some traveling afterwards, ideally on a 90-day Schengen tourist visa. I'm willing to hop over to a non-Schengen country (like the UK) for a couple days and then come back to get the tourist visa if necessary. </p>  <p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen">This post</a> seems similar to my question, except the OP is trying to get the tourist visa without leaving the Schengen area.</p>  <p>Is this allowed? Will the border patrol still give me the tourist visa after my internship visa expires? Will it work through the UK or should I go through another non-Schengen country? I have a USA passport.</p> 
42529	How much money do I need to show as proof of support when applying for a UK tourist visa?	<p>I am an Indian citizen studying in Italy on an Italian visa that expires 19 November, 2015. I have <em>permesso di soggiorno</em>. I want to visit the United Kingdom for my vacations for a week during March. I know the procedures already, however I am a little bit confused about the amount that I must show as a proof of support with my bank statements. I will stay for a week with my friends who are also students in Italy and will be in London for 5 days. What would be the amount in Euros that I need to show for my visit to UK?</p> 
44359	Do I need a transit visa in Dubai?	<p>I'm travelling from Madrid to Brisbane, but I have a 9 hours layover at Dubai Airport. I do not plan to leave the airport, and the connection is with the same airline (Emirates). I'm from El Salvador.  </p>  <p>Do I need a transit visa? </p> 
10504	Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a working holiday visa ends in Schengen countries?	<p>I am an Australian currently on a Netherlands working holiday visa that ends in May next year. I would like to know if when my visa ends I then get another 90 days just as a regular tourist visa as I would like to do some more travel within Europe when my visa ends before going home to Australia.</p> 
48622	Is there any night transportation in Sumatra (Indonesia)?	<p>I have started travelling in the northern part of <a href="https://www.google.co.id/maps/place/Sumatra/@0.0763834,98.1402552,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x2e2aad6120570311:0x1def4d17e789deb4" rel="nofollow">Sumatra (Indonesia)</a> &amp; noticed there was not many (if any) night transportation.</p>  <p>I suppose it's because the quality of the roads is "on &amp; off" (from what I have experienced so far) &amp; it might just be too dangerous.</p>  <p>Is there part of Sumatra where night transportation is common?</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
3515	Travelling with two different passports	<p>I was just wondering if you have two passports (a Chinese one and an Australian one), and you booked your airline ticket with the Chinese one, will you have to show both of your passports or just one?</p>  <p>The thing is, on my Chinese passport, it has my birth name, but then when I became an Australian citizen, I legally removed my Chinese name and replaced it with my English name. So I don't know whether I should just show the passport officials the one that I booked the airline ticket with.</p>

40573	Tips for taking a dog on a long distances (multiple day) car trip?	<p>I'm planning a move across the United states (literally coast-to-coast) and my large (75 lb) dog needs to come along. According to google maps it's a 36 hour drive, which I figure will take a minimum of 3 days once some slight sight seeing, eating, and sleeping is factored in.</p>  <p>Clearly I need to bring dog food, maybe a blanket for him to lay on in the hotel room and probably a travel crate. What else do I need to take into account?</p> 
34217	Train passport control from London to Paris	<p>I'm a non-EU citizen, I will be travelling from London to Paris next month, so I was wondering since most countries track entry and leave dates, if I use the train to switch these countries and they don't control it, my UK visa will seem like entry YES but no leaving. Same for the Schengen, I wouldn't have an entry date but I'll be leaving,</p>  <p>Will it be trouble later? Are they controlling this on trains? If not is there anything I should do before?</p> 
47950	Travelling on Business visa to UK for tourism purposes	<p>I already have a 6 month valid UK business visa received prior to April 24 2015. I was supposed to travel to UK in April but my trip was cancelled on medical grounds. Am now planning to visit the UK in July for tourism. Would it be fine for me to do so? Will I be allowed to enter UK? Should I carry the original invite letter + medical certificate to proof why I didnt go the first time?</p>  <p>thanks</p> 
43808	Is the UK planning to introduce exit checks in 2015?	<p>Someone from America is a tourist/visitor here who has overstayed their 6 month 'leave to enter'.  In order to avoid getting caught, they are relying upon the fact that the UK does only random, sporadic exit checks on departing passengers.  In the absence of an exit check, there is no exact record of when the person left and so overstaying cannot be detected.</p>  <p>Is this likely to change in the the near future?  Will tourists leaving the UK be uniformly subjected to immigration control to assure (among other things) that they have not overstayed?  If so, when should an overstayer leave by so as not to get caught after activation?</p> 
46466	UK Exit Checks: Are people driving via Eurotunnel/Ferry affected?	<p>I am informed that the Home Office has activated a plan to implement exit checks for people leaving the UK.  One way to leave the UK is to drive via the Eurotunnel to France.  Another way is to take a ferry from one of the ports such as Dover.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oEIIK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Are people in cars affected? If so, are cars with UK license plates exempted? Also if so, is it advisable to add an extra 60 - 90 minutes to one's journey time to account for an exit check?  </p> 
49195	UK Immigration Control - Which Queue for EU/non-EU Couple Travelling Together	<p>I'll be arriving at Heathrow in June 2015 with my current girlfriend for a holiday in the UK. I've been trying to find out which immigration queue to join at Heathrow Passport control without much luck.</p>  <p>I have a British Passport, my girlfriend has a non-EU passport.

11501	One-way versus return airfare tickets	<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>  <p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>  <p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p> 
2026	Couldn't return papers to border officials last time. Should I be afraid when going back to USA?	<p>Three years ago I was on holidays in Canada and visited the Niagara Falls. I also went to the American side of the falls and got something like a "short-term visa". I also got a green paper with all my information (name, passport number, etc.) which I should give back at the border when leaving USA again.</p>  <p>When I got back from the USA side of the falls, the border was abandoned. Therefore I couldn't give the green paper back to the officials. Now I'm really a bit afraid that in their computer system I still haven't left the USA.</p>  <p>Next summer I plan to visit USA again. Can I get into trouble at the border?</p>

Where is it best to buy train tickets for this kind of journey?

5601	Does the rotation of the earth affect the travel time from Europe to Australia?	<p>Assuming that a place in Europe is exactly on the opposite side of the earth than Sydney. Now I want to take a plane to travel there. Does it matter if the plan flies with the rotation of the earth or counter the rotation of the earth? i.e. Does it matter if the plane flies westbound or eastbound?</p>  <p>Intuitively I would say it does matter, because if I fly against the earth rotation the goal, in this case Sydney is coming nearer. On the other hand, maybe the plane is still in the atmosphere and therefore part of the earth rotation.</p> 
5853	Does flying east to west generally take longer than west to east in America?	<p>I noticed for a particular round-trip that the portion from the east coast to the west was scheduled to take over an hour longer than the return trip.  I initially thought this was a mistake due to time zone or daylight-savings time oddities, but that does not appear to be the case.</p>  <p>I know there are a number of variables that can affect flight time (type of jet, winds, even potentially rotation of the Earth itself), so I was wondering if this sort of thing is typical.  This particular instance happens to use the same model plane for both trips and is non-stop, so most factors seem to be controlled for aside from east-west vs. west-east.  Is the longer flight a good candidate to arrive early (or is the shorter flight a good candidate to arrive late)?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I recognize from <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/5601/307">this question</a> that winds are likely to be the dominant factor, but that still does not answer my question.  I'm specifically asking about the USA and I don't know what sorts of winds are typical (or whether or not it depends largely on southwest vs. northwest, etc.).</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
48318	Can I bring a shoebox PC in my carry-on bag?	<p>It's a shoebox PC that I custom built and I'd like to keep it in carry-on.  It has wires hanging out and the top is removable so they can see it's actually a computer not something like a bomb. And I'd like to just put it in carry-on and not take it out so it won't break.</p>

49350	Am I allowed to take a GPU in my carry-on luggage?	<p>As I will be travelling to the US in July, I was thinking of buying two graphics cards (R9 390X) over there and bring them back to Switzerland, as computer components are mostly a bit cheaper over there.</p>  <p>I know that the US has some really high security standards regarding international flights. If I take these two GPU's in my carry-on luggage (so they don't break), how would a security officer at LAX react when they see those Graphics cards? I do realise that most people don't actually know what a GPU is or how it looks like. So I am concerned that a security officer might take them from me at an airport when trying to board an international flight.</p>  <p>Believe it or not, I read some really strange stories in forums from people that claim the security officer did not know what a GPU is and thought it might be some sort of a bomb.</p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>: By "GPU" I am referring to the whole graphics card (with circuit board, coolers, etc.) and not just the processing unit.</p>

34332	Forced layover in country for which you have no visa	<p>Last night, I was in the unfortunate situation of a forced extended layover, due to a delayed flight. The airline automatically rebooked my connecting flights and booked hotel reservations, and informed me as such when I checked in. That meant, that I had to exit the passport control, to travel to a hotel outside the airport area.</p>  <p>In my case, it was no problem, since my layover was in the Schengen area, for which I don't need a visa. But what if that was not the case? <strong>What if I had a funny passport, and the layover was not in a country that I would automatically be issued a visa-on-arrival?</strong></p>  <p>Some airports do have hotels or sleeping arrangements inside the airport itself, but not every airport do. Would I be forced to spend the night (and possible longer) on a bench inside the transit area? What if the airport in question do not allow long stays in the transit area, or are not open night-time? Would I be denied boarding at an earlier itineary? Who is responsible?</p> 
49482	Flying over country from which you are deported	<p>A Swedish national was deported from Denmark today. This is a very extraordinary case, since citizens of Nordic countries are usually free to travel without any documents within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Passport_Union">Nordic Passport Union</a>, as well as within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement">Schengen</a> (with documents).</p>  <p>If he wish to travel out of Sweden, there is a significant possibility that he will need to have a stopover in Denmark, or at the very least fly over Danish airspace.</p>  <p>The specifics of his deportation is not known, other than that he will no longer be allowed to enter Denmark. <strong>Generally speaking</strong>, how big of a problem will this pose?</p>  <p>Will he be allowed to fly over Denmark? Will he be allowed to have a stopover in Denmark, as long as he doesn't leave the international terminal? I assume it will work much like when you transit through a country <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/34332/forced-layover-in-country-for-which-you-have-no-visa">in which you don't have a visa</a>.</p>  <p>Of course, practically speaking, since a flight within the Nordic countries is almost considered a domestic flight (no passport checks), it will be hard to regulate, but let's work from the assumption that he will not enter Denmark unlawfully.</p>

Unforeseen situation like out of cash machines, bank limitation, governmental limitation, etc. can ruin your travel plans. Physical money is still the widest used mean everywhere and it's good to have some backup just in case.</p>  <p>The problem is transporting it safely. The best would be carrying it with you, not in bags, or leave it somewhere. The wallet is too visible and can easily be stolen, the backpack the same. Although rare I am sure we all know stories of stolen property in hotels / hostels /etc</p>  <p>What tactics and ideas are there to safely transport and keep money?</p>  <p>Are there any "gadgets" that may help to avoid or dissuade someone from stealing?</p> 
6971	Avoiding the traveller's 'fanny pack' / money-belt	<p>A friend insists on wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_belt">moneybelt</a> while travelling.  Some prefer (shudder) '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_pack">fanny-packs</a>' .</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sBQ5M.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/H5pc0.jpg" alt="Moneybelt"></p>  <p>I can't be bothered, frankly, I used to when I was 20 (have a money belt), but these days it's a wallet for me.  To be fair, I was once pick-pocketed but that was at La Tomatina, I had 10 people pressed up against me and couldn't do much about it - although I admit a moneybelt would have prevented it then.</p>  <p>However, there must be a better solution than a moneybelt? I've seen people with chains attached to their wallets, or carefully putting their wallets in a backpack, but that of course comes with its own risks.</p>  <p><strong>Is there a commercially available, <em>socially acceptable</em>, safe way of securing the money you carry with you?</strong></p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
31583	Validity of Schengen visa	<p>I have a multiple entry Schengen visa issued by the German consulate in Kolkata that is valid until 26.08.2014. Does this mean I have return within 26.08.2014? </p>  <p>If I enter before 26.08.2014, then can I stay up to another 10/15 days?</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
49294	What happens when someone inadvertently enters the UK without a landing interview?	<p>As a follow-on question to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/49195/uk-immigration-control-which-queue-for-eu-non-eu-couple-travelling-together">UK Immigration Control - Which Queue for EU/non-EU Couple Travelling Together</a> for a question that arose in the commentary...</p>  <p>There may remain several routes into the UK where an arriving passenger may not be checked by an Immigration Officer.  Some of these occur on Eurostar (or other rail/ferry) and others might occur at City Airport during certain times of the day, and others occur when a passenger is simply waved through controls (however unlikely this seems in the current era).  Sometimes a walking route through an airport is <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-airport-slammed-by-immigration-watchdog-904196" rel="nofollow">not completely secured which leads to a land-side exit</a> and passengers may inadvertently follow it. </p>  <p>Sometimes these '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16058860" rel="nofollow">loopholes</a>' are <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2071486/Eurostar-immigration-loophole-Border-agency-staff-threatened-Belgian-police.html" rel="nofollow">discovered</a> (proof that this has happened on Eurostar), and sometimes they are not, or <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-politics-15615537" rel="nofollow">go for a long time unnoticed</a>.</p>  <p>This question acknowledges that arrivals through the Republic of Ireland are a separate case and are <em>out of scope</em> here (perhaps the topic of a future question).  Similarly, arrivals at private airfields in the UK are <em>out of scope</em>.  Also it's not appropriate in TSE to list current inward routes where controls fail because I cannot assume that everyone reading TSE is well-intended.</p>  <p>Of course it's easy to say that since it's UKVI's fault the person has no liability, but is this actually the case?</p>  <p>Assuming such routes exist and that the person is well-intended, what is their immigration status in the UK during the time they are present in the UK?  Are they in violation of any particular rule?  More importantly, is there a procedure so that the person can normalize their status?  The corollary to this question is alternatively, should we trust that the possibility of this happening is too remote to consider realistically? </p>  <p>Credible/<a href="http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/store/uk/Macdonalds-Immigration-Law-and-Practice/product" rel="nofollow">authoritative</a> sources needed, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/immigration-asylum-appeal-decisions" rel="nofollow">court decisions</a> and <a href="https://www.tso.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">legislation</a> (including <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/" rel="nofollow">Ministerial Statements</a>) cites gladly welcomed.

Sometimes airlines will charge far more for tickets to that do not include a Saturday night stay, on the assumption that those passengers are business travelers who aren’t flexible and can afford to pay more.

47080	how long can i reapply UK general visa after refusal	<p>I am from Nigeria and i'm doing a one year Internship program with The Marriott hotel in Wisconsin, i applied for the UK visitor visa two weeks ago to visit my fiance who lives and work in the UK,but i was refused the visa because the letter of my work place that i provided was back dated of 2014 which they say they are not satisfy it accurately reflects my current employment circumstance,i also provided my pay slips,but the said they are not satisfied it demonstrate the terms and conditions of my employment, and the also said i did not presented no evidence to satisfy me i have sufficient strong ties and commitments in my country of habitual residence or elsewhere to motivate my timely departure from the  UK.The documents my fiance presented they said it was ok</p> 
38487	UK Family Visa Refused, how long till I reapply?	<p>I applied for a family visa on 19th October 2014 and today (10 November.'14) I got the refusal letter. The documents I have provided are listed below:</p>  <ol> <li>Sponsor's invitation letter</li> <li>Sponsor's bank statement</li> <li>Employer's certificate</li> <li>House rent agreement</li> <li>Copy of sponsor's passport </li> <li>My FDR of National Deposit Bureau of Government </li> <li>Ownership document of my apartment</li> </ol>  <p>However, I intended to stay there for 6 months but being cautious I started to proceed for a 2 year visa which was the very first point that they mentioned in the refusal letter. Was that a reason of my refusal?</p>  <p>As I have been retired from Government service in 2007, I didn't provide any bank-statement in my name. But I DID submit the 'Certificate of FDr (Fixed Deposit)'[as mentioned in list_item# 6] of my pension amount and corresponding monthly interest from it which they completely ignored and stated as "have not provided any other evidence of stated monthly income".</p>  <p>Besides, they also mentioned about the absence of evidence of my living circumstances here in Bangladesh although I have provided the ownership documents of my OWN apartment. Wasn't that enough to make them convince that I live in my own apartment right now?</p>  <p>Moreover, I have another fixed deposit on '6-months interest' payment-basis. Probably that was a mistake from my side that I only provided the receipt of accessing it on 2008 but not afterwards.I assume that was one of the reasons.</p>  <p>Finally, the refusal letter mentioned their doubt about my previous stay in the UK back in 1975. I studied and worked there for 6 and a half years which I mentioned in my form but unfortunately couldn't manage any supporting documents against it. What sort of document was I supposed to submit?</p>  <p>So, that was the details of the scenario now. What should I do in this case? Can I reapply right now? Or ask for an administrative review?</p> 
4364	Where can I find details of the bus between Tbilisi Georgia and Baku Azerbaijan?	<p>WikiTravel and other easily Google-able sources tell me there are buses that run between the Georgian and Azeri capital cities, but no details.

41742	How to find out the speed limit in the US?	<p>As I recently learned on this site, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/41729/1250">US speed limits are not always posted on the street and can vary between different cities even in the same state</a>.</p>  <p>Where do I find this information?

40113	Do any States in the US give traffic tickets for 5 mph above the speed limit?	<p>In Louisiana, USA it's widely understood (unofficially) that one can travel 5mph above the speed limit without receiving a speeding ticket. </p>  <p>Does this rule apply when traveling the rest of the States? </p> 
36572	What does it mean to be in the fast lane in California?	<p>I don't think I've ever understood this. </p>  <p>I travel frequently across the State of California by car.  And I often take the highway to get to many places.</p>  <p>One thing I don't understand is how fast lanes and slow lanes work.  I was recently travelling on a fast lane near San Francisco driving at the speed limit, when I noticed a cop who was travelling behind me honk at me, presumably because I was going slowly? I noticed there was a long line of cars behind me.  </p>  <p>So I moved into the slow lane.  But even weirder is that cars in the slow lane drive at the speed limit, and cars that drive in the fast lane drive way past the speed limit, even cops.  And I have never seen anybody get arrested for going faster than the speed limit, except for really fast drivers.</p>  <p>So I don't understand, even with 6 years of driving throughout California under my belt.  I understand the fast lane is for fast cars, but doesn't driving at the speed limit constitute fast? I really don't understand.  I talked to a local officer and they said that if there are cars tailgating you or lining up behind you, you should change lanes to a slower one, but if I'm already driving at the speed limit, how can I go any faster?</p> 
34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else?

4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
34481	Eating after landing in airport (ORD), can I wait to claim my checked bag?	<p>I will be traveling and arriving ORD later in the day around dinner. Because I will be going straight to a hotel by taxi that has no restaurant, I want to eat at ORD. If I do not go down immediately to claim my bad and eat upstairs what will happen to my checked bag? Assuming no other passenger takes it, will the airline just take it and put it in the office, or will this be a TSA issue? If this varies by airline, than I would like to know for American. Can I tell them when I land to hold my bag in the baggage office since I will be going to eat?</p> 
17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey. He booked <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> and <em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>.<br> Somehow he needed to be earlier at location <em>B</em>, so he took a train and did not take the flight from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.</p>  <p>When he went to the airport to take the "back home" flight (<em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>), he was informed that his ticket was canceled because he did not take the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> flight. They canceled the ticket and sold it to someone else.</p>  <p>Is this normal? The company said it was their right to do so, and he could not get the flight back.<br> The company was Iberia.</p> 
49726	Why are Americans and Asians in such a rush when traveling in Europe?	<p>Americans and Asians (and maybe other nationals) seem to have a tendency to rush through Europe when traveling there.</p>  <p>They will do some epic "10 countries in 2 weeks" or such.</p>  <p>I understand pre arranged trips by agencies might be trying to impress their customers, hence propose some crazy schedule.</p>  <p>But even people arranging their own "Europe trip" seem to repeat that pattern.</p>  <p>I have been traveling in Europe and in other places in the world. And I still don't understand how one could enjoy such a rushed trip. Part of being of holiday is to actually not be stressed out by a tight timetable/deadline, and have time to enjoy what a city offers you. </p>  <p>I feel sad to see this pattern still happening considering the amount of resources one can find on and off-line. How can one enjoy such an absurdity? I don't know.</p>  <p>I hope this may be a "discover" trip before coming back to spend more time in one location or another. But I'm afraid I'm wrong.</p>  <p>I hope this thread will help people tempted by this plan to actually reconsider it. And cut down the number of countries/cities they plan to visit to a reasonable amount.</p>  <p>Europe is an amazing place, and rushing through it really misses the point. Each country/city comes with its own flavor, and I doubt anyone could appreciate that when running around places like the world is going to end tomorrow.</p>

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p> 
47736	Is it safe to knowingly buy an oversized (67-inch) suitcase? Are size limits enforced?	<p>This question is regarding check-in, not carry-on, baggage.</p>  <p>I'm considering buying a very spacious suitcase measuring 31 x 21 x 15 inches, for a total of 67 inches. This is greater than the 62-inch limit most airlines have [1]. My present suitcase measures 63 inches, which better fits the limit than the one I'm considering buying.</p>  <p>Do airlines actually enforce the size limit for check-in baggage, such as by levying a surcharge? Has this happened to you or to someone you directly know, or is it only a theoretical risk? If it's only a theoretical risk, I'll buy this suitcase.</p>  <p>I've had my check-in suitcase weighed several times, but never had its dimensions measured, as far as I can remember.</p>  <p>[1] Except for Emirates, which recently decreased its limit to 59 inches.</p>

44289	Can foreigners cross from Cambodia to Vietnam at the Binh Di river?	<p>I'm thinking of going to Angkor Borei in Cambodia to visit a friend who is volunteering there in my last days before my visa runs out and I cross into Vietnam.</p>  <p>I already have my Vietnam visa.</p>  <p>I can find a border crossing at the Latitude/Longitude 10.953495,105.080577, but I'm not positive what name(s) the crossing generally goes by or what the names of the closest towns or villages on either side are. Possibly <em>Khanh Binh</em> or <em>Banteay Chakrey</em> or <em>Chray Thum</em>/<em>Chrey Thom</em> - at least that's my best guess from more than an hour of Googling and fiddling with Google Maps.</p>  <p>I can see there's a ferry crossing the river and photos of immigration an booth on Google Maps. But this might just be one of the crossings only local Cambodian and Vietnamese residents can use?</p>  <p>Can I cross there too?</p>

(So I presume it must be asked frequently enough to be added to the FAQ page of a major low-cost airline.)</p>  <p>What is the legality of this in US, UK/EU - are you allowed to carry a parachute on an airplane past security or will it be confiscated / passenger pulled out for screening?

49478	Schengen visa refused from German embassy	<p>I am Sri-Lankan staying in Bangladesh working in well established company in Bangladesh. I, my wife and two kids applied for Schengen visa from German embassy in Dhaka. I got only sponser letter from my paternal uncle in Germany. We submit all company letter, bank account, school letters, insurance, booking air tickets, etc.</p>  <p>Our visa refused and the reason given "your intention to leave the territory of the member states before the expiry of the visa could not be ascertained" so I want to know what it mean. And how I apply again fix by this reason? Our annual vacation starts on 15 July for one month. I applied visa for 15 days.

49837	Will I be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document?	<p>I'm a UK citizen residing in the US. I haven't travelled overseas in nearly 2 years and wish to travel to the UK for 10 days in August.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I discovered that my passport has expired. I can apply for a renewal, but the prevailing wisdom is that this will take <em>at least</em> 6 weeks and will generally take more.</p>  <p>I have to travel in August as my wife works in academia, so we have limited travelling options.</p>  <p>It looks like an Emergency Travel Document may be an option, but there's very little information about what constitutes an 'emergency'. In addition, I would need a specific itinerary and wouldn't be able to find out if I could get an ETD until 5 days before travelling, which means I'd have to risk making bookings that I wouldn't be able to then take up, if the ETD application got refused.</p>  <p>Does anyone have any insight into the criteria that consulates use for determining ETD eligibility?</p>  <p>Alternatively, are there <em>any</em> options for expediting a UK passport renewal while in the US?</p>

37998	How safe are the ferries in Indonesia?	<p>I'm planning a holiday to Indonesia and want to visit multiple islands. I had thought to take ferries between the different islands. However, a lot of people have told me bad things about the ferries in Indonesia, including:</p>  <p>(a) The ferries have far too many people packed onto them, well above the limit imposed for health &amp; safety reasons</p>  <p>(b) The ferries are not seaworthy and therefore likely to be involved in a tragic accident</p>  <p>(c) The ferries will give you a rough crossing to the point of making you ill</p>  <p>Basically, I just want to know if the situation is really this bad. For example, are there safety records of Indonesian ferries to give an objective view of the situation?</p>  <p>To be more objective, some pointer questions are:</p>  <ol> <li>Are these things really true, or just people complaining without good reason?</li> <li>What kind of things can go wrong if the ferry operators put more people on than the limit?</li> <li>How frequently do accidents really happen on ferry routes compared to how many ferry crossings there are in a year? For example, is it significantly more likely to be killed in an Indonesian shipping accident than in a plane accident?</li> <li>What are the other ways of travelling between Indonesian islands and the benefits/disadvantages of each? Flying is an obvious one, but is this really practical (in order to reach typical tourist destinations quickly enough to fit into, say, a 10-day long holiday) and does it have any similar safety risks associated with local carriers?</li> </ol> 
5782	Does the brace position change if your airplane seat belt has an air bag?	<p>When I sat down in my seat on my flight this morning, I noticed that <a href="http://stuckattheairport.com/2011/09/15/your-airplane-seatbelt-may-also-be-an-airbag/">my seat belt had an airbag installed</a>.</p>  <p>This piqued my interest; the safety instruction card on the airplane indicates that the "brace position" is to either cross my arms on the seat in front of me (not possible in this case since I was in a bulkhead row) or to bend forward and fold my arms underneath my legs.</p>  <p>However, one would think that the presence of an airbag deploying from the general vicinity of one's waist would make this configuration impractical at best (and disastrous at worst).</p>  <p>Does the brace position change if one's seat belt has an airbag?</p>

31397	Good GPS device to tracking my travels?	<p>I'm in the market for a new GPS device. I have a Garmin eTrex Vista HCx. When travelling I like to have a GPS device on all the time storing and recording location, so I can make maps later. The Garmin is fine, but is several years old. What's the state of the art now? My budget is a few hundred euro.</p>  <p>Things I care about/would like:</p>  <ul> <li>Good battery life. The Garmin gets about ~3 or 4 days (if I turn it off at night). I'd like that.</li> <li>Good GPS reciever. I want something that'll quickly get a GPS lock and won't lose it if I keep the GPS in my bag.</li> <li>Size. Smaller is better, but anything the size of a standard phone is fine.</li> <li>Chargable by something sensible like USB.</li> <li>Ability to store months of data. (tracklogs are small, so anything'll store that)</li> <li>Ability to get the tracklogs in a sensible open data file format (GPX/NMEA/etc.) Something gpsbabel can convert.</li> </ul>  <p>Things I don't care about:</p>  <ul> <li>Directions / voice commands. I want a logger, not a satnav to give me directions in the car</li> <li>Can it store offline maps. I have a phone, which I load OpenStreetMap on to, so I don't care about if it has global coverage.</li> <li>Online web sharing analyse service. I will be looking at the data myself.</li> </ul>  <p>Pluses:</p>  <ul> <li>Manually enter lat/lons with a simple "Direction &amp; distance" to where the thing is. Very basic 'help you not get lost'</li> <li>Ability to store OpenStreetMap maps. Not a deal breaker, but would be a plus.</li> <li>Storing more than just lat/lon/time, some gps loggers store elevation, accuracy of GPS lock etc.</li> </ul>

16674	Where can I find the restrictions and easements that apply to a given UK Rail Ticket?	<p>UK rail ticketing isn't always the simplest thing in the world, but the basics aren't too hard to learn. There are <a href="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Train-times-and-tickets/Ticket-types">broadly</a> tickets valid at any time of the day, those available only outside of peak hours (typically after 9 and perhaps not in the evening rush hour), tickets only available at quiet times, tickets valid only on one train. These are mostly, but not always, valid in flavours of single (one way), day return (out and back the same day-ish), and (period) return (out on a given day, back within a month). That's it broadly, but you'll notice there's a bit of variation in even just those...</p>  <p>Next up, there are rules on what sort of route you can take. These largely revolve around <a href="http://www.atoc.org/about-atoc/rail-settlement-plan/routeing-guide">routing points</a>, not doubling back, direct trains normally being fine, and not taking too long a route if there's a choice. (There's a whole art to making the most of that though, but this isn't the question for that!)</p>  <p>On top of all that, certain routes and/or stations will have additional restrictions, or easements where default restrictions are lifted. For example, one station might be in an area where the default rule is "off peak tickets valid after 9am", then has an additional restriction "off peak tickets to London only valid on trains arriving after 10am", and an easement "off peak tickets to stations along the <em>insert line name here</em> valid after 08:45".</p>  <p>By looking up these restrictions and easements, it's sometimes possible to save money on your journey. In the example above, you might assume you'd need a peak time ticket to travel on the 08:54 to a station along the local branch line, but the easement actually allows you to travel on a cheaper off-peak ticket instead.</p>  <p>How do you go about looking up what easements apply to a given ticket for a journey, and equally what extra restrictions (eg evening peak times or not-valid-via) apply?</p> 
23127	With an Advanced Purchase UK train ticket, what happens if your train is cancelled?	<p>There are broadly three different kinds of <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types.aspx#which" rel="nofollow">UK train ticket available</a>, Anytime (valid on any train), Off-Peak / Super Off-Peak (valid on trains outside of peak hours), and Advanced Purchase (valid on only a specific train).</p>  <p>If you're on an Anytime ticket, if your train is cancelled, you just get any other one, and possibly <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/trains+uk+delays">claim for compensation</a> if it's long enough. For off peak ones, you take any other off peak train, or any train if they're feeling kind and waive the time restrictions.</p>  <p>However, Advanced Purchase tickets are valid only on the specific booked train, which is specified on the ticket, and aren't refundable or cancellable. What happens then if the train your Advanced Purchase ticket specifies you must travel on is cancelled?</p>

48186	How correct is my intuition that tap water is safer in the mountains than in cities?	<p>I'm in Colombia, and recently visited <a href="http://thecitypaperbogota.com/travel/neusa-lake-of-mystics/7250">lake Neusa</a> - highly recommended, by the way!</p>  <p>The advice on drinking tap water in Colombia seems to be generally, big city/tourist hub = fine, otherwise avoid.</p>  <p>Despite this advice, I've still mostly avoided tap water in the cities, apart from brushing teeth. This is mostly due to an instinct of city = pollution = bad rather than anything evidence-based.</p>  <p>However, I noticed whilst up at lake Neusa that my instinct told me the opposite, that the water would be fine to drink. Being up in the mountains, next to a beautiful lake, it gives you a very strong intuition that everything's going to be clean, fresh, and OK. After all, images of mountain vistas are used heavily in marketing for bottled water, so it can't be just me!</p>  <p>Is there any basis in fact for this intuition? Are there any reasons, or evidence, that water up in the mountains is likely to be in any way safer and cleaner than that in towns and cities, given broadly similar water purification standards and technologies? </p>  <p>Off the top of my head I'm thinking it could simply be easier to clean in the first place due to being fresher and more quickly replenished, less exposed to pollution of various kinds, etc.</p>

10957	How can you protect a fragile object like bottle of champagne in your baggage against breaking?	<p>I tend to bring something quite fragile with me as cabin luggage. On my next journey I want to bring a special bottle of champagne (because of sentimental reasons). Unfortunately you can't bring a bottle with you as cabin luggage.</p>  <p>I already know that it is okay to bring a bottle of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10928/is-it-okay-to-bring-a-bottle-of-champagne-on-an-airplane-as-checkin-luggage">champagne</a> as check-in luggage (even confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KLM/status/275517290571788288">the airline (Dutch)</a>.)

50170	Why is a direct flight twice as expensive as a flight with 1 stop where the stop is the same city as the destination of the direct flight?	<p>As the title shows I found the following:</p>  <p>1 direct return flight HK->Vancouver-> HK, priced at HKD 10600</p>  <p>and</p>  <p>1 return flight HK-> Vancouver -> Seattle -> Vancouver -> HK, priced at 5200 HKD</p>  <p>How is that possible? I understand Air Canada might want to compete with different American airlines that are able to service Seattle but I saw the same weird pricing offered by Korean Airlines and other non Canadian/non American airlines. </p>  <p>My question is this: With the 1-stop flight, can I get off in Vancouver and not partake in the 2nd leg of the journey? Can I collect my suitcases at Vancouver even if the final stop is Seattle? Even more important, on the way back to Hong Kong, can I board the flight in Vancouver instead of in Seattle? </p>  <p>I am just wondering because despite all potential reasons of price discrimination, and other marketing techniques that may attempt to explain this price discrepancy, I find no logic in how those 2 different flights are priced at all. Can someone explain?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UfpYo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <hr>  <p>Here the flight with 1 stop , 1/2 price, and the first leg being the exact same as the direct flight.</p>  <hr>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1eGrv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
5408	Why is a nonstop flight sometimes more expensive than multiple connections?	<p>Usually I find a flight I like that uses one or more connections with the same or different companies. In these cases, if the distance between the first and the second connection is not too large, I prefer to go by bus or train and then take the flight. The problem is that sometimes it is more expensive to take the flight in the second airport than to take the flight from the first one. I mean, I'm wondering why sometimes it is more expensive to take only a flight than to take the same flight and another one.</p>  <p>A practical example (and real, you can check with SkyScanner). Imagine I am in Madrid (Spain) and would like to go to Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) on April 1st. The cheapest flight I have found is this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TAM airlines: MAD -> GRU -> GIG : 507 €</p> </blockquote>  <p>Fantastic! GRU is one of São Paulo's airports. That's perfect for me! I'll go on to Rio traveling overland. But then, I look for this flight (MAD -> GRU, non-stop):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>TAM airlines: MAD -> GRU : 597 €</p> </blockquote>  <p>It's the same flight, 90 € more expensive! I've found this kind of behavior a lot of times and I'm intrigued to know why it happens.</p>

49407	Avoiding crew fatigue on empty leg flights	<p>An empty leg is a private jet flight where there are no passengers on-board. It's a one way return trip home for private jet charter or other luxury jets, similar to how rental cars must be driven back to their base if the drop off is in a different city.  Or it can be a pilot who is going some place for personal reasons.  Or a pilot who needs miles or air time.</p>  <p>I am not travelling as crew, but rather as a passenger.  My longest empty leg flight this year was several weeks ago to Stavropol which lasted just under 8 hours.  I have been thinking about getting one from Washington DC to London in August.  Although the duration is about an hour less, and I'm not too concerned about the flight over, I wanted to ask…</p>  <p>Does the directionality, west to east in this case, have an increased effect on crew fatigue?  And if so, is there anything I can do as a passenger to help the crew alleviate fatigue?  Normally on empty leg, you can speak with, or even visit  the pilot (things you cannot do on a regulated flight) but is there anything other than initiating conversation every so often that might be more effective?</p>  <p>Note: I only take the opportunities that are free or near-free, so a full-crew with redundant personnel is rare.  Also FAA regs are usually not applicable.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>One example is that pilots flying commercially have strict limits on   the time that they are allowed to fly or be on duty. Pilots of private   aircraft don't have any limit, other than not to fly if it would be   unsafe.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Source: <a href="http://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/15914/are-regulations-covering-private-jets-different-from-those-covering-commercial-j">Are regulations covering private jets different from those covering commercial jets?</a> </p>  <p>The consensus view on aviation.stackexchange.com appears to wholly contradict TSE's conclusion in the comments given below.  </p>

30927	How do you exit Dutch railway stations with an international paper-based ticket?	<p>According to the media the Dutch railways are getting rid of the paper-based ticket, relying fully on a chip based prepaid card called the ov chip card. I do have such a card. However, when arriving from abroad I can't iniate this journey on a ov-chip card.</p>  <p>I thought a paper-based ticket for international arrivals would suffice. Much to my surprise I noticed today that they were installing automatic doors, technically sealing the exits.

18954	What is the best way to get temporary smartphone data service across multiple countries?	<p>My specific question is about Europe: I'm going to be going through Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and possibly Bosnia/Herzegovina and/or Montenegro.  (I live in the USA.)  However, I'm interested in the overall question for travel in general as well.  Basically what I want to know is what is the overall least painful way to get access to a mobile data network while travelling among several countries.</p>  <p>I have seen previous questions <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5902/is-there-any-3g-data-package-that-works-across-europe">here</a>, <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/16846/what-is-cheapest-phone-option-for-a-short-trip-to-europe">here</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2736/choices-for-prepaid-gsm-data-with-laptop-tethering-in-europe">here</a>.  The main three options described there are:</p>  <ol> <li>Use an international roaming option from your own home-country cell company.</li> <li>Use an international SIM card such as <a href="https://www.keepgo.com/">keepgo</a> or the like.</li> <li>Buy a local SIM card in every individual country you travel to.</li> </ol>  <p>Option #1 is not available for me as I use TMobile prepaid which doesn't offer international data roaming.  Three years ago I went to several countries in western Europe and basically used option 3, but there I was just using voice/text because I didn't have a smartphone at that time.  It worked, but it was a bit of a hassle, not least because it was difficult to get clear information about what will happen when you buy a SIM card in one country and use it in another country.  For this trip data is more important to me than voice/text (I could probably forgo voice/text entirely), but the multi-country issue is still the big question mark.  </p>  <p>What I'm wondering, beyond what is covered in the other questions, is essentially which of solution #2 and #3 is overall more practical.  Specifically:</p>  <ol> <li>Is it always the case that every single national border crossing means you need a new SIM card to avoid impractically high fees?  Most of the questions I've seen about this are from before the recent EU regulations on roaming charges.  I'm not an expert on those regulations, but from what I can find they seem to have somewhat lessened the pain of multi-country travel.  Are there are rules of thumb as far as roaming rates (e.g., if you go from one country to a neighboring country, will the rate increase typically be less than if you go to a more distant country)?</li> <li>At what point does the hassle of buying, installing, and adding money to multiple SIM cards (with the language-barrier problems likely to be present at each step) outweigh the drop in cost?  Also, there can be money wastage associated with getting a new card without using everything on the old card.  On some of the country-specific provider sites I looked at, it's not clear what will happen if you take one of these prepaid data SIMs outside the country.  Will they just not work, or will rates just skyrocket?</li> <li>How does performance compare between the local providers and a package deal like keepgo?</li> </ol>  <p>Basically I'm looking for practical guidance on where the happy medium is between keepgo's simple "$8/day 50MB" and the opposite extreme "maybe you can get cheaper rates by buying 5 different SIM cards and loading them with just the right amount of money".</p> 
5024	What sort of computer / electronic device would you take on a backpack trip around Europe to allow you to keep in touch?	<p>As you may have seen in my other posts I am in the early stages of planning my Eurotrip this summer which if you are interested in seeing the planned route go here: </p>  <p><a href="http://www.tripline.net/trip/Eurotrip_Bruce-6031502460441004AB55F3DFBEB7A2DD">http://www.tripline.net/trip/Eurotrip_Bruce-6031502460441004AB55F3DFBEB7A2DD</a></p>  <p>I am trying to decide what sort of gadget I buy to use for communication with home whilst on my journey through Europe.</p>  <p>So far I see myself with four options:</p>  <ol> <li><p><strong>The Tablet PC (iPad, Asus Transformer, Samsung Galaxy);</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YvWy8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <ul> <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: portable, WiFi, 3G connectivity in some, long battery life</li> <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: expensive, flashy, can't store alot of media e.g. images or movies</li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>The Netbook (Asus EEEpad, Acer aspire, Toshiba, Samsung, Sony)</strong> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/i8jOV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Advantages</strong>: cheaper, keyboard, Wifi, USB, better storage</p></li> <li><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: less portable, power source to charge?, performance</p></li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>The Smartphone (iphone, HTC, nokia N97)</strong></p></li> </ol>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TVGtY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <ul> <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> connectivity Wifi and mobile network, lightweight, can do music and basic movies, can charge with USB in some phones.</li> <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> not able to store photos backup data, not as capable in tasks like a Netbook or tablet pc.</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gzePA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>4- <strong>Laptop</strong> (Dell, Asus, ALienware :D? )</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> powerful, storage for photos, games/movies/music</li> <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> flashy = more likely to get stolen, heavy, expensive</li> </ul>  <p>If any of you have tried travelling with any of these devices or could recommend a particular type or make then please do so: I like photography so I need something to store my photos in from my memory card</p>  <ul> <li>What is Wifi like in Europe is it popular or just in the main cities?</li> <li>Also what is 3G coverage like, would it be worth getting a roaming international SIM card to take with me?</li> </ul> 
20816	What to do about my US iPhone while traveling around Europe?	<p>I've been reading up on how to get my cell phone into Europe and I'm still not entirely sure what to do. I'd prefer to use my iPhone so that I can carry fewer electronics, but my provider will not unlock my phone until my contract expires and it's going to cost a few hundred US dollars to buy out the contract (Bah!). Additionally, newer iPhones seem to only carry smaller SIM cards.</p>  <ol> <li>What are my options?</li> <li>If I am able to get my phone unlocked, are nano SIM cards commonly sold in Europe?</li> </ol>  <p>Note 1: I would only consider buying another phone if it ended up being drastically cheaper than taking my iPhone (though I would still need to bring my iPhone for camera purposes). </p>  <p>Note 2: I'll be in Europe for a several months (in and out of Schengen area) including Western Europe and the more western countries of Eastern Europe.</p>

50145	UK Visitor Visa Refusal: what went wrong?	<p>My husband was to travel to attend my graduation ceremony in UK after many pleas from me. He is a productively busy businessman with a successful growing company and part time job.<br> The visa application was refused on grounds that the officer does not think that he would return to Nigeria within the stipulated time. The officer said that he/she was not sure of my husband's part time job because pay slips were not provided although a letter from the employing government organisation was provided.<br> Why wasn't this confirmed instead of suggesting he is lying or something negative? The officer further said the transactions on my husband's/his company's statement of accounts presented didn't seem to be his or his business'.<br> I thought these things are confirmed and a review of the statements would have shown both monthly payments from the part time job and inward/outward payment for his businesses. Further, are confirmation of documents (statements, letters) no longer done?  </p>  <p>The officer also said and insinuated that goods/equipment bought by my husband in America to be shipped to America was not sufficient. However, evidence of shipment of the various purchased goods/equipment (from America, shipped to America, to the address of the freight forwarders)to Nigeria by the freight forwarders like UPS, Impex were attached.<br> I am confused, I feel crushed and the graduation ceremony for me is worthless attending alone. It seems to me that some visa applicants are first suspected of running to greener pastures in UK. </p>  <p>What went wrong?<br> What really was the objective reason for the rejection? Why is it that genuine visa applicants are rejected and reasons given suggest that the applicant is either dishonest or has ulterior motives.<br> Is there any need reapplying? If yes, what could change? Thirdly, what is the time interval for new application after rejection? Also, wouldn't this rejection affect future visa applications to other countries when needed?</p>  <p>Thank you for the swift response. As regards your questions, the reasons for refusal said "you state you work part time with XYZ and as evidence you have provided a letter from them which states that you have done freelance work for them from 2012; however you have provided no documentary payment slips as evidence of payments you receive from them." "you state you have a business called ABC, you provided receipts of goods purchased online to be shipped to America; however this is not evidence of your net income" "I am not satisfied you have demonstrated the level of income you have stated" "you provided bank statement for ABC company and yourself with no provision of evidence of funds paid into these accounts so I am not satisfied that you own the funds" It is based on these the officer said he/she is not satisfied he would return to Nigeria within the stipulated time.</p>  <p>The part time government body had said they issue pay slips to permanent employees only. For people in their category, the form they filled upon engagement with the organisation and the letter is all they have. The statement of accounts were for 6 months period and the transactions there actually took place as stated in the accounts. The payment on the part time job also shows in the statement monthly. Reading the statements you will see payment for goods online. The receipts for the purchases and invoices/airway bills from the freight forwarders were also attached to show that the goods were delivered to Nigeria. Duty payment receipts were also included. He was also the successful bidder for a contract from one of the international NGO's and the email from the NGO to him on that was included amongst other documents. This job alone needs his time so he is in no way idle.</p>  <p>Lastly, the application was done in Abuja but treated in UK.</p>  <p>Added: Also, he is a first time applicant to UK. I do not know if this plays a major role in making decisions.</p>

I counted it and I found out that there are a lot of coins from 25 different countries.</p>  <p>I know that normally banks don't exchange foreign currencies in coins, but is there a way so that I can still get some money for my foreign coins?</p> 
11633	Travel to Cuba as dual citizen (USA+other)?	<p>Suppose I am a U.S. citizen with dual citizenship with another country.  Citizens of this second country are allowed to travel to Cuba.  Suppose further that I live and work outside the United States and have a non-U.S. bank account containing funds in a currency other than dollars.</p>  <p>If I travel to Cuba using my passport from this 2nd country and using my non-U.S. financial resources, could I get into trouble upon return to the United States?</p>  <p>When I return, could I list Cuba under "countries visited" on the customs form without fear of repercussions, using the explanation that I traveled on a foreign passport and paid for my trip from foreign resources?</p>  <p><strong>Are U.S./dual citizens subject to the Cuban embargo when traveling on their non-US passport?</strong></p> 
10	When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?	<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>  <p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p> 
26930	How can I reduce expenses on currency conversions?	<p>I would like to know the best way to reduce expenses on currency conversions.

50403	What does this road sign mean? (Germany; red circle and X on a blue background, with a right-pointing arrow.)	<p>I'm driving for the first time in Europe—in Munich, Germany—and I came across an intersection where there seemed to a "main" signal above, straight ahead, and a "side" signal to the right, near the bicycle lane. This side signal had the aforementioned road sign affixed to its pole—a red circle and X on a blue background with a right-pointing arrow.

7968	Can US cards be used in countries with chip-and-pin systems?	<p>I'll be visiting the UK in a few weeks, and I understand that the UK credit/debit card system works on a "chip-and-pin" system. As far as I can ascertain via Google, US cards don't have this system on them. I've also read on some websites that certain readers will not process cards without the chip-and-pin, but I'm not sure how widespread such readers are. </p>  <p>With that in mind, is it likely that my US-issued card  will be generally usable in the UK and other countries with the chip-and-pin system, or should I be ready to exchange cash? In addition, does credit/debit make a difference in this regard?</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p>

47180	Refused entry to UK, not sure what to do	<p>I'm a writer and theater/film director who has been traveling nearly all my life without incident. In February, I decided to pull up stakes in NYC and move to London. I am a freelancer and I'm working with three different organizations in NYC so I wasn't working illegally in the UK. I was, however, seeing if there might be some opportunities in London, ie. meeting with Artistic Directors of various theatre companies to see if they might be interested in producing my work. </p>  <p>In April, I was invited to a conference in San Diego and then a film festival in Switzerland. I didn't think it would be a problem if I went and then bummed around in France for a few days since I hadn't broken any laws and had left the UK well under my six month leave to stay. Well, when I tried to return to London, I was denied entry at Luton. The border control officer said I didn't have enough funds for a two month stay and put a black cross over a stamp in my passport. They put me in a detention room until the next flight back to Lyon, which was the following morning. I don't know anyone in Lyon so I ended up going to a friend's place in Paris. </p>  <p>After a few days of not knowing what to do, a friend suggested that perhaps I should try going back to London on the Eurostar since border control is in Paris. I wondered if I ought to go to the British Embassy but was deterred by something on their website that says that a visitors visa could take up to three weeks (I can't sit around here in Paris for three weeks) and anyway, the decision ultimately is with the border control, so I decided to take a chance on the Eurostar. I bought myself a return ticket in two weeks to Paris just so I had something to show. </p>  <p>Well, the UK border control denied me entry after giving me a third degree. They accused me of lying and seeking work in the UK. They also insisted that the amount of money I had was not enough to live on for two weeks. So I'm back at my friend's place in Paris, wondering what to do. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to ever get back to the UK? I had to cancel one meeting and I'm wondering if I have to cancel going to the Sheffield DocFest. (Two of my projects were accepted to programs there.) </p>  <p>Should I apply for a visa from the British Embassy? Will this really take three weeks? When I started to say something about obtaining a visa, the border control officer cut me off and said, "Why are you going to the Embassy? This has nothing to do with the Embassy. We make the decisions." </p>

34554	Bank balance for getting a Schengen visa?	<p>I won a contest to visit Belgium and the Netherlands for a week from India. The accommodation and travel is paid by the company.</p>  <p>They have asked for my income tax returns and bank statements along with my passport for the visa application. I have a bank account I regularly use, but I collect my pay in cash, as I work in a non-profit firm. I do use the account regularly, but only when I need to buy something online, for example.</p>  <p>Right now I have a balance of about €2000 in my bank account. Is that sufficient for visa approval? Do they need my paychecks to be reflected in my bank statement?</p>

If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?

17984	Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal?	<p>There are tricks such as <a href="http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/" rel="nofollow">"fuel dumping"</a> or <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/" rel="nofollow">"hidden city ticketing"</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even "hopping off" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>  <p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>  <p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>  <p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>  <p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p>

40664	Carry on bag packing advice	<p>I was on a flight once that boarded and then we sat for almost 4 hours before we even took off. Even though my bag was stuffed full, all I really had to help pass the time was a bag of M&amp;M's and a magazine. As we sat there, I saw another guy that had a carry on bag that didn't look that full but it seemed like he had everything he needed. Over the hours I watched him pull out things including food, drink, book and computer. He even pulled out a battery to charge his phone. Obviously he was a professional traveler that knew how to pack, unlike me. It left me wondering how much trial and error he went through to get where he was.</p>  <p>I saw a news article today where people had to sit on the plane for 12 hours before they even took off and it reminded me of my flight.</p>  <p>I was wondering if anybody would like to share some of their tips for their carry on so I could pack like a pro. Thanks</p> 
50590	Uk visa got refused planning to re apply	<p>Me my husband and my 4yrs son as a family applied family visit visa last month to visit my husband sis in uk.

39908	No exit stamp on leaving Schengen area from Budapest to UK	<p>I'm a Georgian national holding a multiple entry Schengen visa.</p>  <p>Last summer I was traveling to Hungary, spent a few days there, then flew to the UK. The Hungarian border official did NOT stamp my passport on exiting the Schengen area. I had to enter it again a few days later and the German border guards were confused by what had happened. Finally they let me enter.</p>  <p>Now I have one more entry stamp into Schengen than exit stamp and run into problems EVERY time at a Schengen border.</p>  <p>Is there a way to fix this?</p> 
43808	Is the UK planning to introduce exit checks in 2015?	<p>Someone from America is a tourist/visitor here who has overstayed their 6 month 'leave to enter'.  In order to avoid getting caught, they are relying upon the fact that the UK does only random, sporadic exit checks on departing passengers.  In the absence of an exit check, there is no exact record of when the person left and so overstaying cannot be detected.</p>  <p>Is this likely to change in the the near future?  Will tourists leaving the UK be uniformly subjected to immigration control to assure (among other things) that they have not overstayed?  If so, when should an overstayer leave by so as not to get caught after activation?</p>

27225	How do I decide whether to be worried about having enough blank pages in my passport?	<p>I am planning a long trip over a year from now. The tentative itinerary is</p>  <ul> <li>Canada</li> <li>USA (maybe LA, maybe Hawaii, doesn't matter, I have Nexus)</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>New Caledonia</li> <li>Vanuatu</li> <li>Fiji</li> <li>Samoa</li> <li>New Zealand</li> <li>Cook Islands</li> <li>Tahiti</li> <li>Easter Island</li> <li>Chile (or possibly back to places we have been before)</li> <li>Canada</li> </ul>  <p>I will be traveling on a Canadian passport. All of these countries are (for me) "you can stay 30 days without a visa" or "visa on arrival" except for Australia, which is an electronic visa. </p>  <p>In my past travels, some countries have been pretty good about fitting 4 stamps on a page (eg Bulgaria stamped on the way in and out, but they chose the page that the Netherlands had used for in and out.) However not all have been. Australia put their entry stamp on an otherwise empty page and then found a different empty page for the exit stamp. </p>  <p>I have three blank single pages scattered among the stamped-on pages, and then a stretch of 12 single blank pages running to the end. My passport is one-third full, then, and I have almost 3 years left on it. But I am a little worried this trip will fill it up. If each of the 10 not-Canada, not-US places consumes one page for the entry stamp and one for the exit, I will not have enough pages. But if they're more like Bulgaria was, I'm fine. Further, if travel from New Zealand to the Cook Islands and from Easter Island to Chile is considered domestic, there may not even be stamping involved for those legs.</p>  <p>It is not possible to add more pages to a Canadian passport. It is not normally permitted to renew less than a year before it expires, though you can request it and you need a good reason. "My passport is full" is a good reason. I don't know if "I have calculated my passport will be close to full" is a good reason or not. Further, I don't intend to spend long enough in any place to allow for the time it would take to renew my full passport and continue along my journey, should it become full along the way.</p>  <p>Bottom line: not just "should I be worried?" but "how can I tell whether to be worried or not?" Some specific subquestions:</p>  <ul> <li>is there a way to tell whether a given country uses a 1/4 page standard size stamp, or glues a piece of paper into the passport, and the size of that piece of paper?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance which countries use exit stamps?</li> <li>is there a way to tell in advance whether trips between countries that belong to each other are domestic (eg LA to Hawaii will not generate anyone a stamp) or not - thinking of the Cook Islands and Easter Island for me, but generally applicable</li> <li>any specific advice about wildly early renewal of a Canadian passport would also be good</li> </ul> 
50271	Bribing Indonesian police for missing motorbike license	<p>I really hate to do this, but it seems like I most likely will have to bribe the police at some point because I do not have a motorbike license and I'm driving a scooter in Indonesia for several weeks.</p>  <p>See the related questions in this topic:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/49898/9395">Ride a 125cc scooter in Indonesia if I only have a European car licence?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/44392/9395">Is it safe to drive a motorcycle in Bali without IDP?</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>So my question is: what is the minimum amount (in 2015) I can expect to pay when the police stops me and start pressuring me for some bribe? </p>

35575	How to get to London Heathrow from Shepherd's Bush in light of possible Tube strike?	<p>My flight is at 8:40am Saturday.

42830	Tube delay on a cross-London rail transfer, who to claim compensation from?	<p>This is another wrinkle on the existing <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10898/for-a-uk-rail-delay-which-train-company-do-you-claim-compensation-from">For a UK rail delay, which train company do you claim compensation from</a> question. Assume you buy a ticket from a London tube station to your destination, which therefore includes a tube journey at the start. (Such a ticket might be a "London U12 to Cambridge", for example)</p>  <p>On such a journey, the tube is suspended, and you consequently arrive at the National Rail station to commence the train part of your journey much later than you should have done. As such, you get to your final destination late.</p>  <p>Were it Train+Train, first train delayed, then the answers in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10898/for-a-uk-rail-delay-which-train-company-do-you-claim-compensation-from">this question</a> would cover it. However, in this case, the initial delay is caused by the tube (operated by Transport for London / London Underground), and not a train. In this case, who should you be approaching for delay compensation? TFL, responsible for the initial delay? Or the rail company who first carried you after the delay, as the first train company you dealt with?</p>  <p>(I tried asking TFL, they said that as I was travelling on a rail ticket I had to contact the first train company instead. Contacted them, they said talk to TFL. I therefore need to work out who should be responsible to re-complain to, since both are pointing the finger at the other...)</p> 
13711	What equipment should I travel with to increase the odds of good internet and phone connectivity?	<p>Getting decent internet and telephone coverage while traveling is not a given.

49482	Flying over country from which you are deported	<p>A Swedish national was deported from Denmark today. This is a very extraordinary case, since citizens of Nordic countries are usually free to travel without any documents within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Passport_Union">Nordic Passport Union</a>, as well as within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement">Schengen</a> (with documents).</p>  <p>If he wish to travel out of Sweden, there is a significant possibility that he will need to have a stopover in Denmark, or at the very least fly over Danish airspace.</p>  <p>The specifics of his deportation is not known, other than that he will no longer be allowed to enter Denmark. <strong>Generally speaking</strong>, how big of a problem will this pose?</p>  <p>Will he be allowed to fly over Denmark? Will he be allowed to have a stopover in Denmark, as long as he doesn't leave the international terminal? I assume it will work much like when you transit through a country <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/34332/forced-layover-in-country-for-which-you-have-no-visa">in which you don't have a visa</a>.</p>  <p>Of course, practically speaking, since a flight within the Nordic countries is almost considered a domestic flight (no passport checks), it will be hard to regulate, but let's work from the assumption that he will not enter Denmark unlawfully.</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days.

I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p>

44647	Are the Schengen "airport transit visa" even checked?	<p>I was reading about Schengen transit visas today, and in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/30569/do-i-need-a-visa-to-transit-in-the-schengen-area">an answer</a> I saw that Schengen requires some people to have an airport transit visa. This visa is apparently for entering the international transit area of airports located in Schengen, i.e. not entering the Schengen area, not crossing any border.</p>  <p>This means that to just get out of the plane that brought you there, you will need a visa. In the answer, it is mentioned that it is the duty of the airline that flew you there to check for this visa, that they risk a fine.</p>  <p>But, in fact, as far as I know, airline crew is not entitled to perform any police/border duty, is it? In many cases they check the passengers' passports to make sure passengers are allowed at their destination because airlines are supposed to carry the passengers back if passengers are not allowed (I vaguely remember reading about this), but I am not sure airlines are allowed to deny any passenger to board for lack of visa.</p>  <p>On top of that, there is no control directly at the exit of a plane in Schengen area, so if a passenger merely transits in the international area, it is not even possible to control this person was there.</p>  <p>So, is this airport transit visa rule actually enforced? </p>

They will do this without prejudice if you ask them to; plus an ECM will review the decision if it is adverse to you." how to claim for this in our future application if u can it would b very helpful for us.</p>  <p>the booking we submitted was ticket bookings it was mention in the guidance of required documents. for future application all of the personal circumstances are the same except the amount for the cost of trip we mentioned earlier my husband by mistakenly mentioned the whole family trip cost including (Plane ticket, living expenses and the money) he have for this trip instead of his personally. can we change it in each application the cost belongs to personally, It may make a wild change as compare to previous application. does it going to effect on the decision for the future application.

50944	Boarding denied as the final itinerary did not include the Schengen visa issuing country	<ol> <li><p>We got our Schengen visa from the Italian embassy. The bookings that were used in the submission for the visa had had to be cancelled as they were provisional and since the visa took time (received just 2 days before our travel date) they were all expired. We therefore had a short time left and made an entirely different itinerary, going to Austria, Hungary and the Czech republic.</p></li> <li><p>At the airport we were denied boarding the flight to Austria by Austrian airline staff. They asked for our itinerary and we told them the truth: since the visa was delayed we had changed the program at the last moment, indicating that we would still be going to visit Italy once we entered via Austria. They asked us to wait until they could confirm with an Austrian border police representative. The airline staff sent a copy of our visa to them seeking their approval before we would be allowed to board the flight. We were then told that the representative had denied our boarding and we had to abandon our entire schedule.</p></li> <li><p>Since we already have a visa, can we rearrange the entire booking to Italy (max days) and then smaller trips to Austria, Hungary, Czech, etc. </p></li> <li><p>Should I be checking with the Italian embassy if at all there is an objection on the existing Schengen visa, considering the fact that the matter has already been reported to the Austrian border police representative. </p></li> <li><p>I am traveling with my family and want to avoid any further issues now. I am willing to change our itinerary matching with the visa requirement of Italy with max days and first entry into Venice. However my exit would still be from an Austrian port.

For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
49478	Schengen visa refused from German embassy	<p>I am Sri-Lankan staying in Bangladesh working in well established company in Bangladesh. I, my wife and two kids applied for Schengen visa from German embassy in Dhaka. I got only sponser letter from my paternal uncle in Germany. We submit all company letter, bank account, school letters, insurance, booking air tickets, etc.</p>  <p>Our visa refused and the reason given "your intention to leave the territory of the member states before the expiry of the visa could not be ascertained" so I want to know what it mean. And how I apply again fix by this reason? Our annual vacation starts on 15 July for one month. I applied visa for 15 days. We plan to stay 15 days in Germany and travel to Sri Lanka and back to Bangladesh.</p>

36007	UK General Visa Refused, how long till I Reapply	<p>I am a peruvian who has a permanent resident in Australia and live in Sydney (27 years), I wanted to travel to the UK and visit some friends, i applied online but my application got refused. I put a friend as a contact as i was planning to stay as his place for a few days but maybe stay in different places depends where i go.</p>  <p>The decision was that i didn't provide evidence of my friend's personal circumstances and is unclear if i have a friend in the UK to visit. <em>This mas my mistake as i only ask for his info but never for a referral or invitation letter</em>.</p>  <p>The other point was the evidence of my my financial circumstances it was a bank letter and that only shows the balance of one day but do not show the financial commitment of an applicant nor do they show the source of any funds in an account. *i am a bit confused with this one as i dont know what to show, do they want a 6 months bank statement with all my transactions? isn't that going to be a lot of paper to print and send?? *</p>  <p>I also send additional info as my itinerary of the fly that i have already pay, a letter of my employer confirming the time I was going to be away (1st Oct - 18th Oct). </p>  <p>So i don't know what to do , can i reapply again with additional information? because the fly is quite close, what kind of extra info can I show to ensure the application is going to be approved.</p>  <p>This refusal caught me unguarded i didn't know this was going to happen as it is just a simple holiday. When i Applied (14 August) i haven't planned much and i bought the ticket cause it was cheap but they asked so many questions as where i was going to stay so i just asked my friend for his address as i was planning to stay there for a few days but the others i wasn't sure maybe look for places in airbnb or similar.</p>  <p>Another information that i can give is that i have been given recently the Australian citizenship i just need to wait a few months to do the official pledge and i can apply for an Australian passport and i think with that i don't need to apply for any visitor visa. But that's not gonna help me with the flight been set in October.</p>  <p>What should I do?? Can i reapply? postpone everything? I appreciate  any kind of help.</p> 
46134	how long should I wait before applying for a visa after being refused entry?	<p>I was denied entry to the UK last week (without a visa which was possible BUT was rejected for a few reasons) and was wondering how long I should wait before applying for a visitor's visa?

14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days. I have already got visitor's visa for the same on my Indian passport. Particulars mentioned on my visa are:  1. 'Etats Schengen' , 2. Single entry 3. Dates of visit. &amp; 4. Type of visa : C.  I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p> 
35348	As a native English speaker, which two further languages would give me the most travel utility worldwide?	<p>This follows on from a travel conversation a group of us had in a hostel in London.  Assuming I am travelling randomly between countries and continents, which two languages in addition to English would provide the most usefulness in any given country?</p>  <p>I suspect Spanish (North America, South America) and French (Europe, Africa) but with the base understanding between French and Spanish maybe the time would be best spent learning another language?</p>  <p>This question is a real puzzler since the following constraints apply</p>  <ul> <li>Length of time required to be "functional" in the language (cost-time trade off)</li> <li>Chance of reaching proficiency within any meaningful timeframe (Mandarin)</li> <li>Regional dialects destroying proficiency (Arabic)</li> <li>Easier Secondary languages underpinning the society (Arabic versus French argument)</li> <li>Similarity of Language families (Romance) leading to wasted effort (Italian v French)</li> <li>Utility of the Language (German versus English when English is understood)</li> <li>Enjoyment is a minor consideration</li> </ul>  <p>Happy to consider any other thoughts but it is a really interesting topic for consideration if you are linguistically minded. </p> 
48536	Can I wear a bulletproof vest while traveling on British Airways from Heathrow?	<p>I'll be wearing it all the time anyway once I arrive at my hostile destination but how about wearing it during the flight? It makes sense to wear it in case someone try to hijack the plane.</p>

50944	Boarding denied as the final itinerary did not include the Schengen visa issuing country	<ol> <li><p>We got our Schengen visa from the Italian embassy. The bookings that were used in the submission for the visa had had to be cancelled as they were provisional and since the visa took time (received just 2 days before our travel date) they were all expired. We therefore had a short time left and made an entirely different itinerary, going to Austria, Hungary and the Czech republic.</p></li> <li><p>At the airport we were denied boarding the flight to Austria by Austrian airline staff. They asked for our itinerary and we told them the truth: since the visa was delayed we had changed the program at the last moment, indicating that we would still be going to visit Italy once we entered via Austria. They asked us to wait until they could confirm with an Austrian border police representative. The airline staff sent a copy of our visa to them seeking their approval before we would be allowed to board the flight. We were then told that the representative had denied our boarding and we had to abandon our entire schedule.</p></li> <li><p>Since we already have a visa, can we rearrange the entire booking to Italy (max days) and then smaller trips to Austria, Hungary, Czech, etc. </p></li> <li><p>Should I be checking with the Italian embassy if at all there is an objection on the existing Schengen visa, considering the fact that the matter has already been reported to the Austrian border police representative. </p></li> <li><p>I am traveling with my family and want to avoid any further issues now. I am willing to change our itinerary matching with the visa requirement of Italy with max days and first entry into Venice. However my exit would still be from an Austrian port. Will there be any issue?</p></li> </ol>

45244	Cheap Internet access in Cuba for tourists?	<p>We just arrived in Havana, and have discovered that Internet is a bit of a rarity here.  Most large hotels offer Internet for CUC6-10 per hour.

How do digital nomads survive in the digital desert that is Cuba?  Are there any tips and tricks for getting inexpensive Internet here?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen).

50764	Schengen Visa Refusal from the Spanish Consulate	<p>I applied for a Schengen visa via the Spanish embassy.

965	Using an Amazon Kindle onboard a flight?	<p>Airlines don't let you use electronic devices when the plane is taking off/landing. Let's suppose I have a Kindle 3, and I have turned off wireless (i.e. both Wifi and GSM/3G is off). </p>  <p>Since you don't need power or the battery to read what's on the screen (the magic of eInk displays), it's technically 'off' when I'm reading it, right? </p>  <p>Can I still use it when the flight is taking off? Have any national aviation authorities passed judgement on this?</p> 
50758	Is there a website that lists last minute opportunities?	<p>Are there any websites that list last minute travel opportunities? either just flights or flights with packs.</p>  <p>I have total freedom and I am situated in Europe.</p>  <p>A couple of airlines companies I knew used to do this.   They would sell their empty seats, cheaper, last minute. I don't think this happens any more. Does it?</p>  <p>Unfortunatly googling is not too effective since "last minute" is a very common word to sell. Maybe some expert information will be more effective.</p> 
51185	Schengen visa application refused on the ground of "Not fully justified purpose of visit". What should I do now?	<p>I am from India and I am travelling to Netherlands, Spain, France for 15 days. I have applied from Netherlands for my Schengen visa. I have submitted all my documents: round trip flight tickets, hotel bookings (which I did from booking.com), travel insurance, approved leave letter from my office, bank statement. However, my visa got rejected and the reason given to me was:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Justification for the purpose of the and conditions of the intendend   stay was not provided.

No other purpose was stated at the time of application,   or if it was, insufficient documents were provided. to demonstrate the   purpose of stay. As a result, your application is rejected."</p> </blockquote>  <p>Then we have mentioned that your documents are not reliable.</p>  <p>Please let me know, how should I proceed from here. Should I reapply for the visa? or should I cancel my trip? </p>

47223	Can I apply for Schengen visa from London as foreigner?	<p>I hold Kuwaiti passport, and will be in London until mid June on personal matter. I plan to travel for tourism in summer to Europe, and I'm wondering if I can apply for Schengen as Kuwaiti on tourist visa in London. </p>  <p>Are there any embassies that accept such conditions? </p>  <p>Thing is, if I don't while in London, it may be hard to get visa from Kuwait during summer as it gets too crowded. </p>

18812	Road Trip planning tool	<p>I want to make a road trip through the USA with two friends. Are there any good tools that help us planning this? Like marking spots on a USA-Map, attach pictures and comments, draw lines from one marker to another and so on. It would also be nice if you could see who did what (write a comment, attach a picture...) and maybe even support email notifications.</p>  <p>So far, I only found this one: <a href="https://www.myscenicdrives.com/road-trip-planner">https://www.myscenicdrives.com/road-trip-planner</a></p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>EDIT: Yes, I saw <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7813/road-trip-planner-online">this question</a>, but I think my question is more specific (working in a group, augmenting markers with pictures, comments etc.) :) Also I included one of the answers (myscenicdrives.com) in my question to emphasize, that I'd like something more "rich" :) But you are right, I should have included that question at least as reference, so thank you!</p> 
5912	In which cultural regions is taking pictures of people considered offensive?	<p>I have the impression that in Muslim countries taking pictures of people is often not welcome. On the other hand there are other countries where people really enjoy it (and also sometimes expect some money). In which places in the world (countries, cultural regions) is it considered offensive when a tourist takes a picture of local people?</p>  <p>Also should you always ask for permission or does it depend on the region/situation?</p>

30656	Long-life SIM cards in Europe	<p>I regularly travel to Europe (Germany, Poland, France, Switzerland). Every time that I arrive in a country, I buy a cheap prepaid SIM card. The problem is that all these cheap SIMs have a short inactive life, due to their pay-as-you-go nature. For example, most of them will die after 3 months of inactivity, and it is almost impossible to reactivate them.</p>  <p>Is it possible to buy a (probably expensive) SIM, which work for a long time regardless of its activity? I wish to have permanent mobile numbers in certain European countries.</p>  <p>For instance, I travel approximately once a year to Europe. Every time, I should email my friends that next week I will be in Germany, and after arrival I will text you my new number to reach me. I wish to have a permanent German mobile number, as I can email them that next week I will be in Germany and you can reach me at my German number (which is already in your phonebook).</p> 
14085	What do I need if I want to travel from USA to Mexico with a rental car?	<p>During the summer, I plan to rent a car in Calfornia, USA and do some roadtripping in the south-western part of the USA.

24248	Driving from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore for someone who is not a Malaysian or Singaporean citizen	<p>I am considering, at some point in the future, driving from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Singapore. Assume I am not a citizen of Malaysia or Singapore and will receive a 14 day tourist visa upon land entry.</p>  <p>Is this possible? If so, how would I reasonably go about doing this?</p>  <p>Driving from Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru and then finding alternate means (bus, taxi) onto Singapore is acceptable. I suspect the requirements to drive in Singapore are much more stringent then driving in Malaysia. Please recommend the means to get from Johor Baru to Singapore if I can only drive to Johor Baru.</p> 
9250	What are the typical meals in Japan?	<p>I'm going to Tokyo for tourism and I'm wondering what are the typical meals that one tourist may get during <strong>breakfast</strong>, <strong>lunch</strong> and <strong>dinner</strong>. Also, what are their costs?</p>  <p>Notice that I'm a tourist staying at a hotel, that is, I probably won't have any <em>homemade</em> food. However, I want to enjoy their culture the most I can, so I'd like to eat like them and not have any western fast food, western breakfast at the hotel or... anything western, I think you got it :)</p>  <hr>  <p>EDIT</p>  <p>Ok, to clarify, It is more of a cultural question, I'm interested in finding out what they eat during <strong>breakfast</strong>, <strong>lunch</strong> and <strong>dinner</strong>, and since prices can differ a lot, this info is just a plus if we have.</p>  <p>For example, in Brazil a typical breakfast is coffee with milk and bread with butter; it's a secondary meal - lunch is the main meal. That's very different from USA, probably. You can have this breakfast in any bakery for US$ 2.</p> 
18187	Is it possible to go on a tour of the Stack Exchange headquarters?	<p>On the Stack exchange network, podcast, blogs, and more, we hear a lot about the team at Stack Exchange Inc. headquarters in New York City, the work environment and the like.</p>  <p>We were discussing this in the Travel chat and wondering if it was at all possible to tour the headquarters, even if a virtual tour, to see what it looked like.  Obviously visiting the actual headquarters would be ideal (I'd post pictures!) but we'll take what we can get.</p>  <p>If only a virtual tour is possible, and a staff member happens across this question, an ideal answer would include photos ;)</p> 
5922	90 Day rule on the US Visa Waiver Program not expiring if you go to Canada	<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>  <p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,   including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the   United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less   without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the   VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards   the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'll be there on a 1 year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver and now I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver.  This seems to imply that 90 days after touching Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the count.  What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I re-start the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it??</p> 
911	What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?	<p>I've travelled a lot.  Living in New Zealand or the UK means anywhere is likely a flight, but I've always flown economy.  Twice between LA and Auckland I managed to get the exit row after talking nicely to the check-in girl, but apart from that, nothing.  I've spoken to ticket agents, tried 'check in chicken' (where you wait until the last minute before checking in, hoping there's an overbooking of economy) but have never managed to get an upgrade, while others I know seemingly get them quite often.  What strategy have you used or do you suggest to achieve this?</p>  <p>My next flight is from Melbourne to Tokyo, and I plan on trying all of these ;)</p>  <p>(Related questions on <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17183/101">car hire</a> and <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17026/101">hotel</a> upgrades)</p>

18720	Do I need both a UK visa and a Schengen visa?	<p>I am a Filipino Citizen working in Qatar and have a valid Residence Permit. I am planning to visit my wife's sister in the UK, and afterwards we are planning a Schengen tour with the other family member living in the UK.

22088	My last name is not the same on ticket as on passport; rest of details are same	<p>I'm traveling from JED Saudi Arabia to Singapore by Saudi airlines. My last name doesn't match the passport. But all other details are same, e.g. passport no., DOB, etc. </p> 
16644	Am I going to have trouble flying with a reversed name on the ticket?	<p>I'm flying to Peru with my girlfriend next week and I realized that her name is incorrect on the reservation.</p>  <p>Instead of <em>Sally Marie Jones</em> it's <em>Jones Marie Sally</em>.</p>  <p>We're flying into Houston, then Lima, and in Lima we switch airlines for our flight to Cajamarca.</p>  <p>I booked the ticket with Orbitz who made the reservation with United. United booked the flight with LAN air, the Peruvian airline.</p>  <p>Both companies say that they are unable to change the name because of TSA restrictions not allowing a name change. I asked if I could just cancel and re-book, but United said they could not do this because there are multiple airlines involved.</p>  <p>A note has been attached to the reservation explaining the issue, and the United rep said that they would be able to print her boarding pass with the correct name. However, he said there are no guarantees that she'll be able to fly because although the boarding pass will be correct, the ticket will still have the reversed name.</p>  <p>I was prepared to just take the chance that it will all work out, seeing how it's really obvious the name is just backwards, but with recent events I'm worried that US airport security is going to be extra strict for the next little while.</p>  <p>Is this something I need to worry about, or are chances good that this will work out fine?</p>  <p>The United rep said there's a chance we could cancel the United flights and get a new ticket with the correct name for no cost, but we'd have to pay for new tickets within Peru ($500 out of the total $1300 ticket cost). I'd rather not do this unless there's a reasonable chance we'll have trouble at the airport.</p> 
38744	Name on RyanAir ticket abbreviated in passport	<p>I have booked flight tickets for a large group of people. Unbeknownst to me, one of the passengers has two family names, and the one I used, is actually abbreviated in the passport (I know, weird). In example:</p>  <p>"Oliver Doe" on the ticket<br> "Oliver D. Smith" in the passport</p>  <p>I've told him that this is not a problem, but he is not easilly conviced. Personally I never use my full name, and I also change the spelling of my name to better suit ancient ticket systems that does not accept weird characters. I'm up to roughly 200 flights without issues. ;)</p>  <p>The passenger has a driving license with his full name, and the flight is within Schengen – return trip Denmark to Hungary on a Danish passport.</p>  <p>The biggest problem, is that we are flying RyanAir, who do not accept driving license as ID. Changing the name on the ticket costs €110, meaning we're probably better off buying a new ticket. Not even sure if the name change fee includes the return trip.</p>  <p>Will he get away with the abbreviation, if he has a driving license to "back it up"? Of course both his passport and driving license has photo, so it would be hard to argue that it's a different person – but I've heard RyanAir may be unreasonably strict.</p> 
36522	Middle name missing on flight reservation, API needs middle name	<p>We are flying with Monarch, but I booked the ticket through a package holiday company and forgot to give my husband's middle name at the time of the booking (they did not ask for it). We will travel to Tunisia and will have to provide API (Advance Passanger Information) at the check-in desk and as the API requires the full name (first, middle and last name) I am worried that they will notice that my husband's middle name is missing from the flight reservation.  </p>  <p>Is there a rule that flight tickets have to contain middle names as well? I checked Monarch's website and although the middle name is emphasised for the API, it is not specified for ticket bookings; moreover, if you book your ticket online, they only ask for first name and surname.</p>  <p>Do you think this could create a problem? Can he be denied from boarding? (I don't want to call the airline, as I've heard airlines love charging for extras such as a name change so I am not sure if I would be provided with accurate information.)</p> 
23615	Name mismatch on airline ticket/insurance	<p>I have a group booking done by an Indian provider for my trip to Europe.  The booking is on Qatar Airways for me and my wife. Now there is an issue with the booking name for the ticket and insurance.</p>  <p>Actually what happened was that both of us had got new passports (after adding of spouse name), but the Indian provider by mistake booked as per the details against old passport.</p>  <p>So for the ticket;</p>  <ul> <li>My name is same in both old/new passport (First Middle Last)</li> <li>My wife has the name printed as First Last...which are the same in both old/new (but the new passport also has the middle name)</li> <li>The insurance has more visible details from the old passport (like passport number, address..again my wife has a different address in the new passport)</li> </ul>  <p>Can these cause any major issues at the airport? I have already asked the travel operator to send me the updated ticket/insurance as per the new passport. But I was just wondering if they could not for some reasons...</p> 
38488	Airplane ticket booked under my middle name	<p>I use my middle name pretty much everywhere.  At work I used to book travel myself and would always book under my first and last name.  We recently hired an admin who booked travel using my middle and last name.</p>  <p>Jet blue refused to change the ticket (or perhaps wasn't able to?).  The only option was to cancel the flight and re-book it at the last minute price, of course.  The other option is to show up to the flight and risk TSA refusing to let me travel.</p>  <p>Any advice?</p>

51384	Is there a legal depth limit for scuba divers in Turkey?	<p>Last year (2014), the guys from our dive center in Turkey told us that there is a (new) <em>legal</em> depth limit of 30m (100ft) for all scuba divers (including CMAS 3* and PADI Dive Master) which is enforced by the coast guards. The only exceptions seem to be training dives.</p>  <p>Is it true that there is (was?) this kind of limit, or did they just pretend it to prevent us from diving deeper?</p>  <p>Note: I do <em>not</em> care about limits by diving organisations (PADI/CMAS/...) or insurances.</p>

51507	Abu Dhabi: Transit time and US pre-clearance question	<p>My parents will be traveling to the US (JFK) from India (BLR) and I am planning to buy their tickets on Etihad. I have a few questions regarding the transit and the US pre-clearance:</p>  <ol> <li>The flights I am looking at right now are EY237 (BLR-AUH) and EY103 (AUH-JFK). It seems like the transit time is going to be about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Is this sufficient to go through the US pre-clearance?</li> <li>Once the pre-clearance is done, will they need to go through any additional checks/anything at JFK?</li> <li>Since they will only be transiting through AUH, is a visitor/any visa required? I checked one of the websites and it says that a visa is not required if the transit time is &lt; 4 hours. Is that correct?</li> </ol>  <p>Anything else that we need to be aware of?</p>  <p>Edit: Edited per suggestions below. </p>

My nationality is Pakistani</p>  <p>I want to visit my sister living in UK (British national) but she is living under government support <em>Housing Benefit</em> (since divorced). So if I want to go visit her is it better to go with General Visit Visa and book a hotel or living with her is not a problem? </p>  <p>Since her house is government supported and has only 2 rooms, and I have enough financial statement to have a journey on my expense, would it be better if I mention that I have a sister but I will stay in a hostel and the letter from my sister tells the same? What do I need from the sister side (like her Passport etc).</p>  <p>Also lastly I need the proof for the return to Germany, so as per my thinking will it be enough if I show them my enrollment letter with enrollment in the semester or do I need a special letter from university.</p>

Google instead offered me two Wikipedia articles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_basis_code">Fare basis code</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_class">Travel class</a> one of which is probably another word for the same thing, but I'm still not sure, so why not ask a bunch of experts like all of you?</p>  <p>My guess is it's the former and that non savvy fliers would kind of assume that it's the latter but is actually more technical?</p>

49393	How do I clear an incorrect red flag on my US Visa for overstaying, when in fact my departure date has not been recorded in the database?	<p>I am a resident of New Delhi, India. I received a 10 year B1/B2 type US visa on 17th Jan 2014, which expires on 15th Jan 2024. On account of this visa, I travelled to the United States for 15 days in the month of February last year, from 11th Feb 2014 to 24th Feb 2014. </p>  <p>I again have to visit the United States from 26th June to 21st July, on account of my acceptance into the prestigious Hansen Summer Institute 2015 Fellowship program being held at the University of San Diego. During the verification of my documents for the same, I learnt that my visa has been red-flagged for overstaying on acount of my previous journey. I didn't overstay my visa duration and have NO idea whatsoever what led to them red flagging my visa. I was in and out of US in just 15 days. </p>  <p>I tried to check my travel history on the US Customs and Border Protection website, which showed only my date of arrival (11th Feb, 2014) at JFK Airport, NY. The date of departure was absent, which leads me to believe that somehow the information of my exit from JFK Aiport, NY on 22nd Feb, 2014 was not recorded due to some clerical error.  But this issue, in which I have absolutely no fault at all, is causing me a lot of trouble as I have to fly to US again on 26th June.</p>  <p>I am desperately trying to get an interview at the consulate office. Right now they are saying that my case has been forwarded my case to the embassy and I need to just wait for them to revert back. It's been 7 days since I sent them the email and have received absolutely no word from their side.</p>  <p>I have my flight tickets booked for the United States on 26th June, all accomodation arrangements for me have also been made, and therefore it is extremely urgent that you reply back with the relevant details as soon as possible. I have effectively only 11 days left.</p>  <p>I have a copy of my air ticket from New York on the 22nd Feb 2014, by which I came back to New Delhi on 24th Feb, which along with the stamp at Indian immigration should dispell any doubts. </p>  <p>Right now I am not able to get an appointment at the US consulate because there is no pre-defined procedure for this sort of a thing.</p>

However, I haven't lived in Germany for 4 years. Until now I've always lived in different countries, but for at least a year, and thus could get local insurances. However, if I would only stay in a country for 1-3 months I guess there is too much bureaucratic overhead to get local insurances.</p>

However, the personal accounts differ significantly in the details and are very anecdotal.</p>  <p>So far, Anrusstrans has not responded to my emails, requesting information, nor has a handler in Mersin.</p>  <p>Who has the lowdown on this? How often and on what days does the ferry leave Mersin? How much does it cost for a foot passenger? Interesting to others, how much does it cost to transport a motor bike? A car?</p> 
18126	Where can I socialize with young Japanese people?	<p>One of the things I like about travelling to Japan is that it's possible, if you know some Japanese, to travel to destinations where your fellow travellers are predominantly domestic travellers, rather than from your own country. I enjoy having a two hour breakfast talking to fellow travellers, late nights in an izakaya, or talking in English to schoolchildren at a museum. The problem is, most people I meet are either schoolchildren or retirees!</p>  <p>Outside of public holiday periods like Golden Week, what destinations within Japan have a large proportion of travellers who are Japanese, and in their twenties and thirties? Preferably not overwhelmingly male.</p> 
51677	Meeting young people in Mongolia, especially outside UB	<p>Compared to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18126/where-can-i-socialize-with-young-japanese-people">Japan</a>, I know that Mongolia has a lower population density, but also a lower average age.</p>  <p>Will I have any difficulty meeting young people of both genders? In particular, are people in their twenties and thirties still in the countryside, or have they all migrated to UB?</p>  <p>(I've already heard that bars and nightclubs aren't particularly safe for single, foreign males, BTW)</p> 
13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation. Here are two links that are quite contradictory:</p>  <ul> <li><p><a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10379/schengen-visa-rejection">Schengen visa rejection</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0">http://www.expatua.com/forum/index.php?topic=6506.0</a></p></li> </ul>  <p>My situation:<br> I visited Portugal in Dec 2012 for 29 days on a Schengen visa valid from Dec 1, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013 for research purposes (I am a Ph.D. student). I want to visit Sweden from Feb 10, 2013 to May 10, 2013 (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). Will the 90/180 rule be applicable to me?</p> 
40393	How safe is traveling from Texas to Mexico by bus?	<p>Given recent violent, drug-war-related crime along the USA/Mexico border, what are the risks of traveling from USA to Texas by intercity bus? Have there been incidents involving international buses in the recent past? Are there cities or routes that are lower risk to travel via than others?</p>  <p>I was thinking of traveling from Dallas to Monterrey.</p> 
49636	Obtaining a UK and Schengen Visa in a Single Application or Single Step in China	<p>Normally, the UK does not participate in Schengen and does not honour Schengen visas; and there is no reciprocity between Belgium and the UK where tourist visas are concerned.  As a probable result, and historically, there has been no commingling of operations in the <em>application process</em>.</p>  <p>If a Chinese national in China contemplates visiting the UK and Schengen (via Belgium) in a single visit, is there a possibility of combining their visa application? Or making their application in a single step? Is there a "one-stop-shop" available? If so, how would a Chinese national take advantage of it?</p>  <p>Note: Schengen requires Chinese nationals to have a visa prior to departure.  The UK has a similar requirement.  There is no opportunity for a Chinese national to receive "leave to enter" at the border in either country.</p>  <p>Note: Chinese nationals are the largest base of end-users in the UK visa regime, with slightly under a half-million visitor visas annually.</p> 
31087	If I have an outstanding medical bill in America, can I go back there?	<p>In 2007 I was in Texas when I fell really sick. I was rushed to hospital because my throat closed up and walked out with a medical bill of $1,200. I had travel insurance but they where being difficult in paying the claim, so I never did. I am travelling to Hawaii in November this year and I am worried that I will not be allowed into the country due to my outstanding bill?</p> 
42194	Land crossing to America from Mexico with ESTA - 90 days reset?	<p>I am planning on transiting to Los Angeles on an ESTA (I will be in the USA for maybe 2-3 weeks) from there I want to cycle into Mexico and the rest of Central America. 5-6 months later I  would like to cross back into USA from Mexico at a land crossing and cycle north to Canada. Will I be able to get 90 days at the border going into USA or will my time in Mexico reduce the days? </p>  <p>I have an Australian passport.</p> 
44941	Is it possible to extend my Schengen visa?	<p>I am a Zimbabwean on holiday in UK on a 6 month family visitor. I got a 30-day Schengen visa so I can visit Europe as well. I just want to find out if it is possible to extend the Schengen holiday visa from UK or Europe without having to go back to Zimbabwe first?</p> 
49627	What is the closest US equivalent to UK Ordnance Survey Maps?	<p>In the United Kingdom, we have very detailed mapping available via the government-run Ordnance Survey. Their maps, while not best suited for long distance navigation are invaluable for outdoor activities, due to the level of detail and landmarks available, especially on the 1:25000 Explorer series. See below for an example.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DvW2l.jpg" alt="sample of the explorer map near Bampton"></p>  <p>I can see that the US equivalent agency, USGS, produces detailed topographic maps (and available to download for free) of much, if not all of the country. However these seem to be lacking in detail in terms of paths, landmarks, facilities, vegetation etc. Are there any US maps better suited to outdoor pursuits than the USGS topo maps?</p>  <p>It occurs to me that the US may not have a single national answer to the question. If it helps, I'm interested especially in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks and surrounding areas, and areas close to Idaho Falls.</p>  <p>Paying for the maps is not a particular concern (although cheaper is always better). It would be useful to know what the availability (local stores, book stores, gas stations, internet/ etc) of suggested maps is.</p> 
9793	Camera store near Split, Croatia?	<p>I'm travelling in Croatia with my Canon 5D Mark II, and I forgot my charger at home. Is there a store in or around Split that would sell such a thing?</p> 
736	How far into Washington, DC should I drive before taking the Metro?	<p>I plan to drive to Washington, DC, but my understanding is that the Metro is far better than driving for actually getting around downtown DC.  First of all, is that assumption correct?</p>  <p>Assuming the Metro is indeed the way I should ultimately get to my downtown destination, how close should I drive before finding a Metro station?  Should I stop at the first one on the outskirts in Maryland, or should I keep going into the city a bit?  I'm primarily concerned with avoiding traffic if possible as well as generally shortening my travel time.  The travel will be occurring during a weekend (4th of July weekend) in case that is relevant.  My destination in DC is off the Navy Yard station of the Metro Green Line.</p>  <p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: I might have found a last-minute hotel deal downtown.  Can I park <strong>overnight</strong> at the Metro stations that are being suggested?</p> 
30569	Do I need a visa to transit in the Schengen area?	<p>I found many related questions on this site but I am still not sure about the rules. How can I decide if I need a visa to transit?</p> 
48756	Can Indians on UK tourist visa apply for Schengen tourist visa in London?	<p>We are Indians and will be visiting UK on short-stay visas for about 5 months. Can we apply for Schengen tourist visas while we are in London?</p> 
47223	Can I apply for Schengen visa from London as foreigner?	<p>I hold Kuwaiti passport, and will be in London until mid June on personal matter. I plan to travel for tourism in summer to Europe, and I'm wondering if I can apply for Schengen as Kuwaiti on tourist visa in London. </p>  <p>Are there any embassies that accept such conditions? </p>  <p>Thing is, if I don't while in London, it may be hard to get visa from Kuwait during summer as it gets too crowded. </p> 
29007	Do I have to claim and re-check in my baggage in international transit when traveling with the same airline?	<p>I'll be traveling to Memphis, Tennessee form New Delhi, India via Qatar Airways.</p>  <p>The itinerary would be: New Delhi &lt;--> Doha || Doha &lt;--> Chicago || Chicago &lt;--> Memphis</p>  <p>Would I be required to claim and re-check my baggage at Chicago even though all the flights were booked with Qatar Airways or can I check it in all the way from New Delhi to Memphis without re-checking in the baggage again?</p> 
13783	Overtaking regulations when driving in Europe	<p>I've got a question about how to drive the car in Europe on Highways. In the US, I can overtake another car on either side, and I am fine.</p>  <p>In Europe I was told that I have to drive on the right side (Germany), and to overtake on the left side of the other driver.</p>  <p>Now I had following situation, and I did not know how to handle this properly: I was driving along on the right lane, the Autobahn was 3 lanes wide on my side, and was going around 110 km/h. Someone overtook me, but he stayed on the middle lane, and suddenly got slower. He wasn't really in front of me, so I could not change to the left lane, but I was told I may not overtake on the right side.</p>  <p>Would I have to brake in such a situation, or should I just ignore it, and overtake him again on the right side?</p>  <p>(I overtook him, and he was on the phone, so I guess that was why he got distracted and slowed down that much).</p> 
21235	Going to Canada and transiting through the US	<p>A person with two nationalities, Nationality A from a EU country, and allowed on US VWP, Nationality B from a country not covered by VWP</p>  <p>In Canada - Permanent Resident (but the papers point to Nationality B)</p>  <p>Let's see what TIMATIC has to say:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>A return/onward ticket (or electronic ticket record) must   be <strong>to a final destination country other than Canada</strong>, Mexico   or contiguous (adjacent) countries or territories situated   in or bordering the Caribbean Sea For details, click here . If   passenger holds proof of residence in, <strong>or is transiting the   USA to such a country or territory</strong>, an onward/return ticket   to that country or territory is accepted. </li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>So, after reading this multiple times it seems it contradicts itself (especially the bold parts)</p>  <p>The question is, would it be possible to transit through USA on Nat. A even if the reason to go to Canada is (in) Nat. B?</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p> 
37747	reapplying for tourist visa to UK after refusal	<p>My daughter wanted to travel to UK on tourist visa as her student visa expired. She wanted to go there to meet her sister working there on tier 2 (general visa). She by mistake showed my bank statement instead of her own as she had her current account in Lloyd bank in the UK. Visa was denied to her on the ground that in India she did not show any evidence that she is able to maintain herself – No evidence to show that she will leave england at the end of visit. </p>  <p>Is it ok to buy ticket before getting visa? How long should she wait before reapplying for visa?</p> 
45648	Can I convince embassies to accept my overpaid credit card as a proof of funds?	<p>I managed to put a few $k USD in my PayPal account from a side business over time. Now, the only problem is PayPal does not have the option to send me the money in a cheque to cash it due to my location, as they do not have that option for countries other than the US. The only option I have is sending the money to my credit card. </p>  <p>In addition to that, my credit card issuer allows me to overpay my credit card, and the excess amount will be treated as if it was on a debit account, that's cool but I can't withdraw that money in cash, because cash rules will still apply if I try to cash that amount from any ATM, meaning I will lose some good % from that money.</p>  <p>So basically I will have a credit card with a few extra $k ready to be spent without taking any credit from the bank. </p>  <p>Will the US embassy or any EU embassy accept this as a proof of fund since it is as good as cash in my checking account (I can provide the embassy with a credit card monthly report which shows this)? I searched and found nothing related to this. </p> 
50590	Uk visa got refused planning to re apply	<p>Me my husband and my 4yrs son as a family applied family visit visa last month to visit my husband sis in uk. For documents we submitted everything which was required ( employee certifacte of my husband, bank statement,pay slips invitation letter from the family in uk, and tickets booking) the reason of refusal of large amount deposit highlighted them in the statement which was indemnity or service money of deceased father of my husband.. We got this from his company because my husband is the only son of his and legal guardian of his mother and two sisters. So they rejected because of lack of evidence of this amount which we didn't provide them also they think that we will not leave uk and trying to get entry in the uk. Although we have every evidence rrgarding money deposit and we are leaving behind our dependents in saudi arabia who are my husbands mother and sister so we have their valid residents permit too. So we are deciding to re apply for the visa with this evidence and supported documents.. How far its gonna b approved any help and support will b appreciated thank you</p>  <p>⦁   THE DECISION</p>  <p>⦁   I Have refused your application for visit visa because i am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph V 4.2 of appendix V: Immigration rules for visitor because:</p>  <p>⦁   You proposed to travel to the UK for 45 days to visit your sister and her family. You have provided UK sponsor letter confirming your visit. In view of proposed close family visa i have therefore considered your application very carefully taking into full consideration the compassionate circumstances surrounding your application. I am however required to also assess your own personal, domestic and economic circumstances in determining whether you are a general visitor travelling to UK solely for the period and purpose you state.</p>  <p>⦁   I have noticed that you never previously travelled to UK or any other country with similiar immigration requirements,and you therefore do not have history of travel and compliance to consider.</p>  <p>⦁   As evidence of available funds, you have provided bank statements from NCB and riyad bank dated 18/11/2014 to 17/05/2015. You claim you are employed by ABC company and earning an average monthly salary of  2777 pounds. However I note that over this period there are salary payments are seen in the bank statement submitted. Furthermore there are large transfer and cash deposits which are six times your claimed salary. you have not provided evidence towards the origin of these recent deposits and in the absence of reasonable evidence. I am not satisfied that these bank statements accurately reflect your personal circumstances.</p>  <p>⦁   I have there been unable to assess your economic circumstances in KSA and as such i am not satisfied your income and circumstances are as you claim and therefore i am not satisfied that you are travelling to the uk for the period and purpose you state on this occasion.</p>  <p>⦁   I have therefore refused your application because i am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you meet all the requirements of the relevant paragraph V4.2 (a) (c) of the United Kingdom Immigration Rules.</p>  <p>⦁   Your right of appeal is limited to the grounds referred to in section 84(1)(c) of the nationality, Immigration and Asylum act 2002.</p> 
44771	Applying for UK visa after refusal	<p>I'm a Russian national reapplying for UK general (6 month) visa.<br> Unfortunately I threated my first application with unacceptable sloppiness and only now come to realize seriousness of consequences.<br> Having that said, I'm going to quote a piece of refusal letter:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>You have stated that it is your intention to visit UK for one week for tourism</li>   <li>You have stated that you are employed as ... for ... with salary .... per month. Your application does not demonstrate that you are employed as stated</li>   <li>You have submitted a one page bank letter from ... stating that there are available funds of ... $. This letter doesn't demonstrate the providence of the funds nor does it demonstrate that you are in receipt of any income from your claimed employment.</li>   <li>I am not satisfied that you are genuinely seeking entry to the UK as a visitor for the period and purpose as astated or that you intend to leave the UK on completion of your visit. Paragraph 41 (i) and (ii)</li>   <li>I am therefore not satisfied that you have demonstrated that you will be able to maintain and accomodate yourself adequately in the UK or that you can meet the costs of your onward or return jouney from the UK   I have therefore refused your application because I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you meet all of the requirements of relevant Paragraph of the UK Immigration rules.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>For the second application I'm collecting all documents possible, which are:</p>  <ul> <li>Proof letter from my employer, letter from employer stating that I have paid vacantion for dates in question</li> <li>Same bank statement + statement from another bank where I have more money</li> <li>Transaction history for the period of half of the year from both banks</li> <li>Aircraft tickets and hotel booking confirmation</li> </ul>  <p>I have two things to ask, I hope that's acceptable to ask them in the same question, since both of them related to my specific above-mentioned situation.</p>  <p>I'm afraid of possible inconsistencies in first and second applications. In the first application I stated that I'm employed at <em>BigFancyCorporation</em>. And I do work there. But, <em>BigFancyCorporation</em> often hire new employees though some sidekick employment agency <em>littleCo</em>. (I't kind of popular situation here and I beg you to not go offtopic about acceptability of that)<br> I checked with both of them, and <em>littleCo</em> guys said that they can write a proof letter that I'm <em>littleCo</em> employee and mention there that I'm working for <em>BigFancyCorporation</em>. To be perfectly clear about my occupation - I've been to <em>littleCo</em> one time for 1 hour 1 year ago.  </p>  <p>I would like to state in the second application same thing I did at first - that my employer is <em>BigFancyCorporation</em>. And attach proof letter with abovementioned content. I believe it's better than stating another employer in second application. It would just look like I've lied at the first time. I'm relying on your best judgements guys to figure out this problem.</p>  <p>Second question is simpler. How fresh documents must be? Especially, transaction histories. Because, I would have to give them away for translation, it takes time. I couldn't find this info online.</p>  <p>Thanks you for going through all these embarrassing details of my life, and thank you for help.<br> I would also appreciate any general suggestions to strengthen my re-application case.</p> 
42820	UK PLAB Visa Refusal	<p>I had applied for a PLAB (Doctors) Visa for the UK to appear in PLAB test. I got refused on the basis of two recent large deposits in the bank statement I provided (my mothers). In reality, these are my own savings which I had deposited in her account to make it more strong. The only objection I got was that I must provide evidence for the source of these deposits. Other than this, I have previously travelled to the UK and USA as well as other parts of the world and my travel history is fine. Can someone please advise on how to proceed and re-apply?</p> 
48380	UK visa bank statement info	<p>I need some info please. I am going to apply for a UK visa for PLAB exam. About the bank account statement, I have a joint account with my brother in an Indian bank, but I am currently not in India. The card is with me and is named after my brother and the statement mentions my name along with my brother's. The card is being used by me for the past 6 months as required. Is this acceptable or will there be some problem regarding this? Anybody with some experience with this?</p> 
48308	Can I rent a mobile WiFi hotspot during my five-week trip to the UK?	<p>I will be visiting the UK for a five week period in the near future, travelling to several different cities, and I wish to ensure I have internet access at all times. Here in Japan, at the airport you can find companies that offer reasonably priced 4G WiFi devices* that you can rent while you're in the country and deposit back at the airport when you leave.</p>  <p>I'm wondering whether the same thing exists in the UK, and at Heathrow airport specifically. It's important that there's no unreasonable data cap. (The only option I found through Google had a 150MB/day limit, which I get through just checking my email**.)</p>  <p>If there isn't a convenient option at the airport, what would be a better option to ensure I can always access the internet while in the UK?</p>  <p><sub>* I'm not sure what the correct term is for these devices, but what I mean is a device that has a 4G internet connection, which it uses to create a WiFi hotspot that you can carry around with you. A USB cellular modem would also work in a pinch, but would mean I could only use the internet on my laptop and not my smartphone.</sub></p>  <p><sub>** I'm being a bit facetious in saying this. I won't use that much data every day but some days I probably will, and I don't want the inconvenience of worrying about the resulting surcharge.</sub></p> 
8225	Is it possible to book an hotel being a minor?	<p>I've been in Morocco nearly a month, and it will soon be time for my return. During my stay here, checking into hotel rooms hasn't been an issue, but businesses aren't nearly as lenient about that sort of thing in America.

I imagine its 90 days because they should start counting from ingress to the USA?</p>  <p>I understand that my 90 days are not reset if I don't leave Canada or Mexico, but I'm confused about the other way. Imagine I went from Colombia => Mexico => USA, would that basically optimise my available time in the USA?</p>

51829	UK Visitor VISA Refusal. Possible future consequences?	<p>Well, I was supposed to visit UK on 20th-22nd July this year to participate in a Competition/Conference as an undergraduate student from Bangladesh. I submitted it on 18th June. But my VISA application got refused. Stating this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>As Evidence of your circumstances you have submitted <em>bank name</em> statement in your father's name... for account number ***** shows a balance of ***BDT (around 2500USD) after a deposit of ***BDT (around 1600USD). There is no evidence of the source of these funds. You have provided electricity bills but no evidence of your father's employment or income. I am not satisfied that the documents you have provided evidence your circumstances and this lends me to doubt that you are seeking entry only for the purpose and duration stated. I am not satisfied that you are genuine visitor and will leave the the United Kingdom at the end of your visit.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I should've probably added another document stating my father's occupation and that he will bear my costs. However, this is like general knowledge in my country is that a father will very likely bear the cost of his children. Probably not so in the UK. Incidentally, I have searched the term '<em>VISA refused for source of funds</em>' from a private window and the first page of Google results are all related to UK VISAs.</p>  <p>What pains me most is that this letter was signed on 23rd July even though I submitted like one month ago. Which means that for the whole time they didn't process my application. They could call/contact me if they needed any further documents. However they didn't which, I think, means they tend to reject applications more than they accept and do not care much about the applicants.</p>  <p>However, I will not reapply for VISA as the event, which I was a participant of, is already over.</p>  <p>I was wondering what are the future consequences of this refusal might have. I have previously visited India for a conference and stayed for 11days. And now that I have this dent in my passport, I want to know whether it will affect my future visits to other countries.</p>  <p>Thanks in advance for the replies.</p>  <p>Edit: There were six of us. We all submitted similar documents according to my knowledge. However, only one got VISA probably because he visited Russia and USA before. Two of us got refused. And the other three are still waiting for their decision.</p> 
51849	Hidden Requirements in UK Visa Applications? (Source of evidence of funds)	<p>This post originates from a discussion with an established TSE user in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/51829/uk-visitor-visa-refusal-possible-future-consequences">this thread</a>.</p>  <p>I applied for UK Visitor VISA for attending a competition while my father will be funding the visit. However they refused my VISA saying, "There is no evidence of the source of these funds. You have provided electricity bills but no evidence of your father's employment or income."</p>  <p>However, when I submitted the visa application I didn't find any article about about explaining unusual transaction or to explain the occupation of the person who is funding my travel.

38120	Get to Schiphol early in the day/sleep at airport?	<p>I will depart from Schiphol on a Sunday at 10:00, and return on some other day at 05:00. What options do I have to travel to/from Schiphol Airport?</p>  <ul> <li>I'd prefer the train, but if I am not mistaken, the first connection from Heerlen will arrive on 09:56, so this is no option.</li> <li>I could take the car, parking for two weeks is 100€. But I will have to drive back after a night in the plane, possibly without sleep. So, no option either, I guess.</li> <li>Third option is to try to get a hotel room. Best rates I found are 150€ per night. Any tips on that?</li> <li>The last night train arrives 04:00. Since I will travel with my sleeping bag could I just take a nap somewhere near/at the airport?</li> </ul>

21090	Biometric passport: How can I know if the chip is still working? Does it matter?	<p>My biometric passport inadvertently spent some time under the rain. It's not badly damaged but some sheets are a bit deformed and there are tiny brown spots on the side. I am wondering if there is an easy way for me to determine if the chip is still working. If it does not, can I still use the passport? Which countries require a biometric passport or actually use the data?</p>  <p>Also, how much of a problem can a lightly damaged/worn out passport be? Is it more likely to be an issue in some countries than others?</p>  <p>PS: Right now, I am preparing for a possible trip to the US and since there is still time, I will most likely ask for a (<s>costly</s>, turned out requesting a new one was free, for some reason) new passport just in case but I would be curious to know if that's really necessary or about potential issues in other countries as well. The passport in question is still valid for more than three years, still has many free pages and was issued by a EU country participating in the visa waiver program.</p> 
1901	What happens if RFID system in my "biometric" travel passport malfunctions when I cross the border?	<p>My travel passport contains the "biometric" RFID chip.

If I go this route, are there any common clothing materials that won't stand up to this sort of washing over time?</p> 
18420	Can I apply for another Schengen Visa when I already have a single entry unused one?	<p>I'm traveling to Belgium for a month for a training and already got my single entry Schengen visa from 29-6 to 13-8 with a 30 days stay duration. My stay in Belgium will be from 30-6 to 28-7 for the training. However, I wish to visit a friend in Croatia and stay there for 7 more days after Belgium; where Croatia will become part of the EU countries in 1/7.</p>  <p>My questions are: can I apply for Croatia as a non-EU country and expect a normal entry OR do I apply for a multiple entry visa from Germany since I will be landing there to go to Belgium even is I don't stay there. If I apply for Germany, can I simply go from Germany to Belgium, then Belgium to Croatia then back home or do I have to pass by Germany on my way back. How long does a visa from the Embassy take to be issued and do they keep the passport? Is it possible that I apply to Croatia from Belgium or not? Sorry for the long question. Your help is much appreciated.</p> 
25975	Schengen visa "refresh"	<p>On August 17th I need to visit a conference in Germany. The problem is that I already have a Schengen visa valid until 9th of August.</p>  <p>I might not be able to get a new one before my flight to Germany, because, as far as I know, embassies take at least a week to give visas (also, airlines require visa information several days before, so the "window" is less than a week). The one I have now was given by the consulate of Spain.</p>  <p>I am a citizen of Russian Federation and I live in Moscow.</p>  <p>Is it possible to apply for a new visa before the one I have expires? </p>  <p>I've tried googling, but the data I found was full of contradictions.</p> 
23350	Traveling on back-to-back Schengen visas	<p>I currently have a valid multiple entry Schengen visa that expires on Feb 10th (issued by the Spanish consulate). I need to visit the Czech Republic from Feb 9th to Feb 15th. For this, I am getting a visa starting Feb 11th from the Czech consulate as I was advised that I cannot have two simultaneous visas. </p>  <p>Is it possible for me to enter Czech republic on the current visa on Feb 9th, and stay past its expiry up to Feb 15th using the new visa <em>without</em> leaving the Czech Republic? Will there be any likely problem either while entering or exiting Schengen zone (I am entering Schengen in Frankfurt)?</p> 
10775	Recommendation for mobile prepaid SIM card for smartphone + home calls in Germany	<p>What SIM card would you recommend for smartphone user for the travel in Germany?</p>  <p>It would be probably the only or the most important connection to the Internet, so large amounts of data and relatively fast transfer is an issue.</p>  <p>There's a need to stay in touch with friends and family, so the calls to the other EU-countries should be as cheap as possible. </p>  <p>According to the first criteria, I've found <strong>T-Mobile</strong> offer interesting. The internet costs 10 Euro/month and after reaching transfer limit it stays relatively fast. According to tests (Galileo from Pro7, AFAIR) it has also the best coverage. However, calls to other countries are very expensive.</p>  <p>According to second criteria, <strong>Lebara</strong> and <strong>Mobilka</strong> are interesting. The calls are very cheap, but there are problems with signal strength in many locations, where T-Mobile has no problem. The voice quality, at least in Lebara, is also limited. They both have the offer of mobile internet with unlimited transfer, but after reaching the high speed limit, the transfer is reduced to 64kbps, which is too slow.</p>  <p>I've found out that <strong>O2</strong> has foreign calls in moderate price, but I haven't yet checked for details. There are so many other options, that it is hard to compare them all without spending the whole weekend on it. So, if someone has found the better option as having 2 sim cards and constantly switching them, this answer would be greatly appreciated.</p> 
14692	Can I travel to Paris for a day with a single entry visa for Schengen from Switzerland?	<p>I am visiting a friend in Switzerland for ten days.

I understand that having already got ‘Etats Schengen' visa, I can travel to all Schengen countries.</p>  <p>I am also planning to visit Paris for a day during my stay in Switzerland. However, I never mentioned this in my visa application. I am planning to take a train from Geneva to Paris and book a hotel in Paris for one night. Can I possibly plan my Paris trip this way as I have Schengen visa, or I am not allowed to travel out of Switzerland as I never mentioned this in my visa application? </p>  <p>Also what does Single entry on my Schengen visa means: does it mean that I can enter and leave Switzerland only once or it means that I can enter and leave the Schengen region only once.</p> 
24158	Why does US Customs & Immigration ask the purpose of my trip when I'm returning home?	<p>As a US citizen, when I re-enter the US, I am often asked where I was, how long I was there, and the reason for my visit.</p>  <p>Why am I asked these things?

I am not therefore satisfied that the funds are yours and available for your use.</p>      <p>Given the above, I am not satisfied you are a genuine visitor who will leave the UK at the end of your visit. Your application has therefore been refused under paragraph V4.2(a). As I am not satisfied as to your financial status I am not satisfied that you have sufficient funds to cover costs without working or accessing public funds.

50904	Slightly illicit: felon traveling on a US passport; will I be refused entry to the UK?	<p>I was convicted of a felony in the US, and my conviction will not be considered "spent" as of the period in which I intend to travel to the UK. I understand if I were to apply for a standard visa I would be summarily denied. However, if I were to simply go there, would I be denied entry on arrival if I were not to volunteer this fact?</p>  <p>Basically, the question is, could I sneak one by them? <em>One</em> being, namely, myself. I have to use up some frequent flyer miles, and I'd decided on going to the UK before this matter of actually being able to go there came to mind. I've no doubt I'll be able to stay out of trouble while in the country, were I given the opportunity.</p>  <p>It would be nice to know if someone in a similar situation had a result, whether it be positive or negative, in that regard. Lacking that, I would gladly hear any wisdom from knowledgeable but less involved parties.</p>  <p>Edit for clarification:<br> I was imprisoned for 3.5 years for a violent offense. There are no restrictions on my passport. I'm primarily concerned with whether or not there are communications between the relevant agencies in the US and the UK as there are between those in the US and Canada and, recently, the US and Mexico, regarding the movement of convicted criminals between these countries, as the answer would save me certain deportation if that were the case.</p> 
47414	Dual-National: Can I get away with the Right of Abode AND a British Passport?? ROA cancelled?	<p>I am British born and a British national through my mother. My father is from Saudi Arabia and therefore I automatically gained the Saudi Nationality.</p>  <p>As a Saudi Arabian national, you are not allowed to hold any other nationality. They however understand that Saudi nationals from mixed marriages may automatically gain 2 nationalities and therefore the rule is basically "you cannot hold 2 passports" and you would have to choose one on the spot if you were caught at the airport there. They don't expect to see UK entry stamps as they are aware we are British nationals because of the ROA.</p>  <p>Previously I used both my Saudi and British passport. I would travel from the UK to Saudi Arabia on my Saudi passport, and from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain on my Saudi Passport (Bahrain is a sort of passage for dual nationals), and then I would leave Bahrain on my British passport and enter the UK like that. </p>  <p>The complicated travel became a headache and I decided to opt for a Right of Abode in my Saudi Passport, which meant I had to cancel my British passport. Travel became so easy and simple to and from Saudi and England!</p>  <p>I discovered that I would have to apply for a 3-month Schengen Visa EVERYTIME I wanted to travel to Europe and now this is the new headache! The simple bargain weekend trips to France no longer exist and I'm always having to check what countries Saudis can visit without a visa :'( </p>  <p>So, I came up with an idea.</p>  <p>I already have the Right of Abode in my foreign passport that expires in 2018. What if I reapplied for my British passport? </p>  <p>I know you cannot hold both an ROA and a British passport, <strong>but what would they actually do to cancel the ROA?</strong>  <em>The info on the UK Border Agency informs us that the ROA is automatically cancelled if you have a British passport.</em></p>  <p><strong>Would they request my foreign passport be sent in to rip out the stamp?</strong> <strong>Or would they stamp a big cancel sign over the ROA the next time I enter the UK with my Saudi passport?? Or is it just cancelled through their computer system and not a PHYSICAL cancellation.</strong> If it's not physical and only on the computers, I would have best of both :'D</p>  <p>I can't find the answers to my questions anywhere and the UK border agency have been the least helpful and are a waste of time.</p>  <p>I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has been in this situation, or knows of anyone who has, or anyone who works in this field. </p>

43970	Turkish transit visa on arrival	<p>I'm flying from London to Mumbai in May, and then back from Kathmandu to London later in the month.  On both journeys I have a short (1-2 hours) stop over in Istanbul.  If everything works, I know I don't need a transit visa because there isn't time to leave the transit lounge at the airport.</p>  <p>However I'm concerned what happens if I miss my connection.  Obviously as I have a through ticket the airline will get me on a later flight and that won't significantly inconvenience my later plans.  But on my outwards journey I'm on the last flight to Mumbai of the day, so if I miss it, I'll have to spend the night in Istanbul.  If that happens, I'd rather pay for cheap hotel than try to sleep in the airport.  Is it possible to apply for a transit visa on arrival in those circumstances?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I'm flying on a British passport, and there are no obvious reasons why I would be refused a visa.</p>

39063	Kenyan citizen refused Schengen visa from Sweden	<p>I am a Kenyan citizen. I applied for a Schengen visa, via the Swedish embassy, for visiting friends and family.  I got my results today and I was denied the visa.</p>  <p>I am a student, I will be done with my studies this month. The person who invited me (my boyfriend) was to cater for everything while I visited him.</p>  <p>I was denied a visa on the following grounds:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not provided</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I clearly wrote in my written statement that I was going to see my man, what we would do etc.</p>  <blockquote>   <ol start="2">   <li>Your intention to leave the territory of the member states before the expiry of the visa could not be ascertained  </li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I am not employed, but I am a student and I gave a letter from school. I have a small clothing business whereby I sell items online. I did not know how to give proof of this as I do not have any tax returns on it, or business registration because it is a very small business, just something to give me some extra income as I study.</p>  <p>I also provided the following documents:</p>  <ul> <li><p>I gave my bank statements, having opened a bank account just because of applying (I did not have an account before) </p></li> <li><p>I gave a lease agreement letter for the apartment I stay in</p></li> </ul>  <p>I would like to re-apply asap because appealing is a waste of time</p>  <p>How can I improve my case above?</p>  <p>Kindly assist I know the rules for visa application is the same everywhere so there must be somebody here who has the knowledge and will be able to help me correct any mistakes that I might have made.</p>  <p><strong>Extra information</strong>:</p>  <ul> <li>My boyfriend is a Swedish citizen, born and raised. He did send an invitation with proof of income and everything, also stated that he was going to sponsor my stay and that I was going to stay with him.</li> </ul>  <p>It is very hard for somebody from a third world country to be approved a visa but not everybody who lives there wants to break the rules of another country so that they can become illegal immigrants.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Also, no, we will not have babies or get married just so that I can get a visa. Relationships don't work that way.</p></li> <li><p>Also,we have decided to appeal but with extra documentation i.e:</p>  <ol> <li>A new extended lease agreement</li> <li>I will enroll for an extra course at my university</li> <li>I'm having my parents write letters also stating they will offer any financial assistance I may need (in case of any emergency), my friends and neighbour as well (to prove social and family ties in Kenya as that was also an issue)</li> <li><em>M-pesa</em> statements&lt;&lt;--(the reason I never had a bank account before is because in Kenya we have something called <em>m-pesa</em> which is a mobile 'phone money transfer and savings service, so I conducted all my transactions there.</li> <li>Receipts for the sales I made in my business.</li> </ol></li> </ul>  <p>Will that improve my chances?</p>  <p>I am not planning on overstaying my visa. I never was and never will be. A visa to visit my boyfriend is listed under visa for friends and family.</p>  <p>P.S the new lease will be for 1 year. The new course will require graduation after my trip i.e when I get back because I'm planning on being back by January as classes will be in session - also since I'll be applying for internship, so need to be back early.</p>  <p>And, I do have a return flight booked.</p>

In preparation for it, even though I applied for a <strong>B1/B2</strong> visa, I was granted a (seemingly rare) straight <strong>B1</strong> visa.</p>  <p>That visa was granted for 3 years and is going to be valid for a long time.

Does this mean I have to explicitly apply for another, B2, visa all over again? Or, if I do travel with my current B1, I can avoid the problem somehow?</p>

35079	How to pass customs in time in case of a flight delay	<p>I'm a non-US citizen flying to the US with a changing time between flights of 1:50 in Atlanta. Since this is rather on the short line according to <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/25729/is-1-hour-and-30-mins-enough-time-in-atlanta-airport">this answer</a>, I was wondering what to do in case of a delay. Since this will be my port of entry, I have to pick up my bag go trough border control, put the bag on field again, and change from international to domestic terminals, etc.</p>  <p>I know that if you are late in Europe, you can ask somebody; in most cases they let you cut the waiting line in customs/check in/etc. if you would otherwise miss the flight.</p>  <p>Is it also acceptable to approach staff with such a request at an US airport?</p> 
2312	What happens if you miss a connecting flight?	<p>What happens if you book tickets through an airline or travel agent, but on the travel date miss a connecting flight (either because the first flight was delayed, or because immigration/security took too long at the connecting airport)? Will you be put on the next flight for free? Are you expected to pay for a new ticket or a change fee? I'm specifically wondering about Continental/United, but also curious about airlines in general.</p> 
41731	Travelling to the US on B1 visa without a business purpose	<p>(NOT a duplicate of <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/39685/tourist-visa-b1">Tourist Visa B1</a>)</p>  <p>Earlier last year, I went to the US for a business trip. In preparation for it, even though I applied for a <strong>B1/B2</strong> visa, I was granted a (seemingly rare) straight <strong>B1</strong> visa.</p>  <p>That visa was granted for 3 years and is going to be valid for a long time. Right now, however, I'm looking to make another trip to the US, this time to visit a friend (so, no business intentions). Does this mean I have to explicitly apply for another, B2, visa all over again? Or, if I do travel with my current B1, I can avoid the problem somehow?</p> 
11114	Can I visit Schengen countries on a long term French Visa?	<p>I have requested for a French long term student visa from India. It's a national visa and not a Schengen visa. My question is that can we still go to other Schengen countries on this visa? If not then can we get a Schengen visa from the Indian embassy in France?</p> 
19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p>

13362	Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?	<p>In case, if I get a multiple-entry Schengen visa in one of the embassies in Ukraine, Kyiv - should my first trip be to the country which issued the visa?</p>  <p>Any there any requirements of this sort? Does this condition vary depending on embassy which issued the visa?</p>  <p>What are the possible consequences on not visiting that country first? Does it somehow depend on country where the embassy is (i.e. non-Schengen and not EU members)?</p>

47894	Where can a tourist apply for a UK Visitor (standard) Visa?	<p>Prior to 24 April 2015, Paragraph 28 of the Immigration Rules was (emphasis mine)...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom   and Islands at the time of the application. <strong>An applicant for an   entry clearance who is seeking entry as a visitor must apply to a post   designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry   clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant.</strong>   Subject to paragraph 28A, <strong>any other application must be made</strong> to the   post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which   has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications   for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of   applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must apply to the   appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where he   is living.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Source: archives at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/archive-immigration-rules" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/archive-immigration-rules</a></p>  <p>This meant that a person could apply in any country that had a British mission competent to issue visas.  So for example, a Russian national who was in France could use the British mission in Paris to apply as a visitor.</p>  <p>But on 24 April 2015, Paragraph 28 now reads...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom   and Islands at the time of the application. An applicant for an entry   clearance who is <strong>seeking entry as a short-term student</strong> must apply to a   post designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for   entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant.   Subject to paragraph 28A, <strong>any other application must be made</strong> to the   post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which   has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications   for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of   applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must apply to the   appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where he   is living.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The text about visitors is gone.  It appears to have been replaced by text about short-term students.  Looking further, Appendix V to the rules contains this statement...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>An application for a visit visa must be made while the applicant is   outside the UK.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Note that this is in an <em>appendix</em>.  So it looks like the applicant must satisfy three conditions... </p>  <ol> <li>outside of the UK (Appendix V) and</li> <li>outside of the UK and Islands (Paragraph 28) and</li> <li>in their home country (Paragraph 28)</li> </ol>  <p>This means in my example that the Russian national touring France would have to return to Russia to get a UK entry clearance.  Or alternatively, that an entry clearance issued in France to a Russian national would be illegal under Paragraph 28?  Or would the consulate in Paris be required to reject the application?  Or more confusingly, if the Russian national were in 'the Islands' (Guernsey or Sark for example) then it's ok for Appendix V, but forbidden by Paragraph 28.</p>  <p>Do all of these conditions hold?  If not, which 'rule' is senior?</p>  <p>Current immigration rules for Paragraph 28 and Appendix V are at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor-rules" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor-rules</a></p>  <p>Note: Not very many of the various VFS and consular sites on the net have caught up with the recent rule changes yet so they are not totally reliable. Please use up-to-date links if citing something.</p>  <p>Note:  Regarding ambiguity over the clause, "where the applicant is living", this has always meant "where the applicant does not require leave to remain or has been given leave to remain for a period longer than 6 months"</p>

35311	One hour Lufthansa transit time in Frankfurt. Origin: Bangalore, destination: Dublin	<p>I have bought a ticket from Bangalore (India) to Dublin (Ireland) through Frankfurt (Germany), both of the flights are of Lufthansa and as a part of the same ticket. The transit time I will have is 1 hour in Frankfurt. Last time there was a 1 hour 20 minutes of time available between changing aircraft, but the connecting flight was late and I was able to board comfortably. Therefore I am not able to estimate this time how long it may take. I was wondering if this is too little time. Also I would like to know what the possibilities are in the case of missing the connecting flight.</p> 
4859	Do I need a US visa to change planes in an American airport?	<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen).

13183	About Schengen 90/180 rule	<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

9890	I have a U.S. tourist visa (B1/B2), is that enough to transit via U.S. airports?	<p>I am going to Canada, I have a valid U.S. tourist visa (B1/B2). Can I transit via a U.S. airport on the way to Canada with this visa? Logically I know I can since I am allowed to enter the U.S. but I am just making sure.</p> 
38996	Can I skip the last leg of my domestic return flight?	<p>I've seen some comments on 'hidden city' ticketing, but am not sure if what I'm considering falls under that description.</p>  <p>My original tickets were MKE-CLE-IAD and back IAD-CLE-MKE.  The airline (United) changed my tickets after confirmation -- no idea why -- they must have taken one of the legs out of their scheduled flights because I can't find it anymore.  So now they have me flying MKE-ORD-IAD and back IAD-ORD-MKE. I live midway between MKE and ORD and the only reason I chose to use MKE was because I need to be in Milwaukee the evening of my return.  So now if I use the full ticket, I'll arrive in Chicago at 2:32, sit around for 2 hours, and hope that the ORD-MKE flight stays on schedule so that I arrive at MKE at 5:30 as planned so I can attend the 7 PM event.   </p>  <p>OR -- I can get picked up at ORD on arrival and be SURE of making it to the concert.  Not checking bags.  Is there any reason I couldn't do this?  I've paid for the ticket and don't expect any part of it refunded.</p> 
4440	Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?	<p>Say I want to book a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago.  Say the airline also flies to St. Louis from Fort Launderdale but has a connecting flight through Chicago.  If I book that flights from FLL->ORD->STL and just get off in Chicago, what possible problems can I run into, assuming I didn't check any bags and only have carry on?  This scenario exist for Southwest, but I wanted this be more of a general question that would apply to all airlines.</p> 
27355	Not flying the first leg of the journey – Company cancels the second-leg ticket	<p>I've a friend that booked a round-trip journey. He booked <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> and <em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>.<br> Somehow he needed to be earlier at location <em>B</em>, so he took a train and did not take the flight from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.</p>  <p>When he went to the airport to take the "back home" flight (<em>B</em>-to-<em>A</em>), he was informed that his ticket was canceled because he did not take the <em>A</em>-to-<em>B</em> flight. They canceled the ticket and sold it to someone else.</p>  <p>Is this normal? The company said it was their right to do so, and he could not get the flight back.<br> The company was Iberia.</p> 
52328	Travelling to US through Canada	<p>I am from Pakistan and hold a Pakistani passport. I have a B1/B2 visa and want to travel to the USA. </p>  <p>Because I want to see a friend of mine in a Canadian airport for a short period of time (e.g. 1 hour), I want to transit through Canada and then travel to the US. So my route would be Islamabad - Dubai - Canada - USA. </p>  <p>For this, do I need a visa for Canada?</p> 
52319	Are 3h 58m enough time to transfer flights in Atlanta (from Colombia to Germany)?	<p>I'm flying from Colombia to Munich with transfer in Atlanta. The transit time is 3h and 58m. The flight is on Sunday and Atlanta, indeed, is the airport with the heaviest passenger transit in the world. Is it reasonable to think that I will have sufficient time to change flights? Am I in high risk of losing the flight? Bear in mind that I will have to pass immigration with a tourist Visa (last time at JFK, I spent almost 2 hours doing the immigration row). I don't know the airport or if I will have to change terminals.</p> 
24542	Can you take only part of a cruise?	<p>I've been searching for details on this for a while, and I know I could just phone some companies but maybe someone here knows. Is it possible to buy only some parts of a longer cruise. </p>  <p>For example, there's a cruise going round Asia, say departing from Singapore, visting Malaysia, Brunei, Philippines, Hong Kong but I only want to travel from Manila to Hong Kong? Is there any way just to book that leg? Or would I have to pay full price? Since cruises seem to mostly sell out I guess there's no real advantage is selling part routes.</p>  <p>If I pay full price would they even let me board in Manila, or is it the same as airlines where if you miss any leg the whole trip gets cancelled and resold? </p>  <p>If I could find someone who wanted the rest of the cruise would they let us split the reservation? </p>  <p>Anyone have any experience of this?</p>

47736	Is it safe to knowingly buy an oversized (67-inch) suitcase? Are size limits enforced?	<p>This question is regarding check-in, not carry-on, baggage.</p>  <p>I'm considering buying a very spacious suitcase measuring 31 x 21 x 15 inches, for a total of 67 inches. This is greater than the 62-inch limit most airlines have [1]. My present suitcase measures 63 inches, which better fits the limit than the one I'm considering buying.</p>  <p>Do airlines actually enforce the size limit for check-in baggage, such as by levying a surcharge? Has this happened to you or to someone you directly know, or is it only a theoretical risk? If it's only a theoretical risk, I'll buy this suitcase.</p>  <p>I've had my check-in suitcase weighed several times, but never had its dimensions measured, as far as I can remember.</p>  <p>[1] Except for Emirates, which recently decreased its limit to 59 inches.</p>

43660	Traveling in Europe Solo - 18 years old. Feasible?	<p>My dream is to spend a month in Europe after graduating high school.  Based on my situation, I will have to travel alone since there is no one else here who would be able to make such a trip.  I am an Eagle Scout, have common sense, and am used to being independent.  My mom is worried that I will be in danger from thieves, muggers, or other unforeseen obstacles.  I plan on visiting the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, and Germany.  Communication should not be a problem since I speak French fluently and will speak Italian and German fairly well.</p>  <p>Here's my question: Will I be relatively safe traveling in Europe on my own for a month?  What dangers or obstacles in particular should I watch out for - are thieves, pickpockets, or muggers common in some areas?  Given that I have a limited budget of ~$3000, would I have enough to purchase basic necessities such as food, train tickets, and hostel rentals for a month?  What else, in particular, should I be aware of as an 18 year old traveling alone for the first time?</p>

52429	Re-Applying for UK Visit visa after refusal	<p>I am a Ghanaian studying in the UK. My husband applied for a General visit visa to come over to the UK to support me in September when our baby is due but was refused on grounds of insufficient funds. Please see below part of visa refusal letter</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li><p>you have stated that you are married and employed as a visual arts teacher and earn 1,100 GHS per month. You have provided a letter from   ...your employer to confirm your employment and income, I note however   that your claimed income is not reflected in the bank statement   provided in your name... You have also stated that you are self   employed through ..., however although you have provided company   registration documents you have not provided any evidence to confirm   income from this source. You have also stated that you receive income   from marking as an examiner for the ....;however the evidence provided   does not confirm your income from this source. I am therefore not   convinced that your financial circumstances are as stated.</p>      <ul>   <li><p>You have stated that you spend 500 GHS  (£97.67)per month on living expenses and supporting your family leaving you with a disposable   income of 650 GHS (£126.97). You state that the cost to you personally   of your trip is 7,300 GHS (£1,426.01). This amount is over 11 times   your monthly income once family and living costs have been deducted   and I am not satisfied that this is credible considering your personal   financial circumstances.</p></li>   <li><p>In light of all of the above, I am not convinced as to your intentions in wishing to travel to the united kingdom. Further I am   not satisfied that you have sufficient funds available to cover your   cost. Your application for a visit visa has been refused under paragraph V4.2 (a) (e)</p></li>   </ul></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>We realised in hindsight that we made some mistakes in filling the form - especially the income and expenditure section - and plan to correct this</p>  <ol> <li>The amount stated as salary was stated in error by himself and his employer and <strong>we have corrected that in a new letter from his employer and on his application form and this reflects accurately in his bank statement. We are also adding a pay slip for April 2015 (the most recent he could find) to confirm this. Is this enough?</strong></li> </ol>  <p><strong>2.    Income from his self employed job is received in cash and he doesn’t pay that into his bank account. In order to maintain consistency we plan to provide explanation in a supporting statement that this is the case as we do not have any evidence to support this. Is this enough or should we remove this from the new application?</strong> </p>  <ol start="3"> <li><p>Income from his work as examiner is seasonal paid twice in a year. At the time he applied he had not been paid for this year, but <strong>he was paid a week ago and we intend to add a pay voucher to confirm this.

34106	Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?	<p>Is there a website or some other way to find out if I need a transit visa for a short stop in the UK on my way somewhere else?

27485	Can I use Google Maps traffic information to estimate driving time for a specific date/time?	<p>In supported regions, Google Maps will tell me how long it will take to drive from A to B in current traffic conditions.

However, is it possible to estimate driving time for a specific date and time of the week?</p>  <p>(For a (long) weekend trip, I'm estimating whether it's worth to take the train from Toronto to Barrie and rent a car from there, as opposed to renting a car from Toronto)</p> 
16691	How to book entire compartments on French night trains?	<p>On the night trains in France, the so-called "<a href="http://www.intercites.sncf.com/trains-et-services/intercites-lunea-train-de-nuit">Intercités de nuit</a>", you have three comfort classes: reclining seats, 6 berth sleepers and 4 berth sleepers. </p>  <p>The railway company SNCF is advertising with a possibility to book privative compartments ("espaces privatifs"). This means that if you are alone or in couple, you can have a whole compartment for yourself, by paying a supplement. </p>  <p>However, when I try to book a trip online I can't see this option. I can only see an option for single female travelers. That's not of great use to me. Thus, could someone please explain me how to book this privative compartments online?  </p>  <p>P.S. I know that it is possible to book four or six persons in one compartment and only effectively use one or two places. That will be very expensive. I am not interested in this option. </p> 
47736	Is it safe to knowingly buy an oversized (67-inch) suitcase? Are size limits enforced?	<p>This question is regarding check-in, not carry-on, baggage.</p>  <p>I'm considering buying a very spacious suitcase measuring 31 x 21 x 15 inches, for a total of 67 inches. This is greater than the 62-inch limit most airlines have [1]. My present suitcase measures 63 inches, which better fits the limit than the one I'm considering buying.</p>  <p>Do airlines actually enforce the size limit for check-in baggage, such as by levying a surcharge? Has this happened to you or to someone you directly know, or is it only a theoretical risk? If it's only a theoretical risk, I'll buy this suitcase.</p>  <p>I've had my check-in suitcase weighed several times, but never had its dimensions measured, as far as I can remember.</p>  <p>[1] Except for Emirates, which recently decreased its limit to 59 inches.</p>

The dimension quoted in the specs is 22 X 31 X 15 (Inches) that adds up to 68. But the airlines allow only up to 62. When I asked the dealer he said the quoted dimensions include the expandable 5 inches and I can use without expanding the luggage volume.</p>  <p>I am traveling from India to Aarhus, Denmark through KLM airlines.</p>  <p>Should I expect any issues w.r.t. checking in this suitcase?</p>

19147	Can I visit Schengen countries on a Type-D German Visa?	<p>I’m going to Germany for a semester exchange and I have a long-stay visa from Germany. Can I travel to the other Schengen states during this period with this visa or do I have to apply for a separate short stay Schengen visa?</p>  <p>My visa is German national visa type D. It is for a duration of 4 months, i.e., longer than 90 days. It says on the visa that the long stay visa is valid in Deutschland, which is different from my earlier visa, which I had when I visited Germany earlier; that one was a short stay visa and said it was valid in Schengen Staten.</p>  <p>Perhaps my current visa means that I can stay in Germany for a period of longer that 90 days can visit the other Schengen states if I don’t exceed the 90 day period.</p> 
45648	Can I convince embassies to accept my overpaid credit card as a proof of funds?	<p>I managed to put a few $k USD in my PayPal account from a side business over time. Now, the only problem is PayPal does not have the option to send me the money in a cheque to cash it due to my location, as they do not have that option for countries other than the US. The only option I have is sending the money to my credit card. </p>  <p>In addition to that, my credit card issuer allows me to overpay my credit card, and the excess amount will be treated as if it was on a debit account, that's cool but I can't withdraw that money in cash, because cash rules will still apply if I try to cash that amount from any ATM, meaning I will lose some good % from that money.</p>  <p>So basically I will have a credit card with a few extra $k ready to be spent without taking any credit from the bank. </p>  <p>Will the US embassy or any EU embassy accept this as a proof of fund since it is as good as cash in my checking account (I can provide the embassy with a credit card monthly report which shows this)? I searched and found nothing related to this. </p>

I'm happy to provide that information but you usually have to send it in an unsecured email, which may have consequences <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13464/what-harm-can-be-done-with-a-copy-of-ones-passport">as discussed in another question</a>.</p>  <p>Could these companies be more responsible, and provide a public cryptographic key at least?</p>  <p>Are there other steps you should take to protect yourself, if you do send by unsecured email?</p>

There was nobody around, just a stranger at another pump. He approached me and politely asked to pay him a gallon or two. He explained that since there is nobody to accept his cash (he claims that he forgot ZIP and could not pay with his credit card at pump). This claim made me cautious.</p>  <p>My question is: Is it safe to pay for a stranger? Can it be dangerous? What would be the best strategy to be helpful while also cautious?</p>

14612	Cheap places to store bags in London for a few hours?	<p>Almost all of the main railway stations in London have <a href="http://www.left-baggage.co.uk/locations.php">left luggage facilities</a>. However, unlike in some European countries, this is a privately run place that stores your bags, rather than lockers. The costs at all of the main stations are <a href="http://www.left-baggage.co.uk/locations.php">£8.50 for the first 24 hours, £5 per day after</a>, and they round up (so the minimum charge is £8.50 for a bag). For most of a day, that doesn't seem too bad, but it feels a bit steep to me if I just need to stash a small suitcase for 1-2 hours...</p>  <p>Most of the main museums and galleries in London offer storage for coats and small bags (tends to be free at the paid for museums/galleries, a recommended donation of £1-£2 at the free ones). As an example, the <a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/visiting/bag-sizes-permitted-in-the-national-gallery">National Gallery only allows bags up to 43 x 66 cm (17 x 26 inches)</a>. The <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/facilities.aspx">British Museum only allows bags up to 40x40x50cm</a>. In both cases, larger bags aren't allowed in the building. (Very small bags are normally fine, bigger ones up to the size limit generally have to be left in the cloackroom). Those sizes are a little smaller than most cabin baggage sizes.</p>  <p>If you have a small-ish bag with you, that's too big for museums, and you want to pop into a museum or gallery for an hour or two, is there any option other than going first to the nearest station and paying £8.50?</p> 
52540	Does renewing passports have an impact on the visa process, if previously I was refused?	<p>I was refused twice for a student visa by the German embassy 3 years ago.</p>  <p>I applied for a tourist visa at the same embassy, but they again refused and in the refused letter they mentioned reason no#9.</p>  <p>I appealed and again they refused.</p>  <p>Now I have three refusals already linked with my passport.</p>  <p>My question is, if I plan to travel in the future will these three refusals hurt my chances for obtaining visas?</p>  <p>Specifically, <strong>can I improve my chances by renewing my passport?</strong></p>

38204	How to register Russian tourist visa while on the Trans-Mongolian railway?	<p>My partner and I will be starting our Trans-Mongolian adventure in about a week or so, but after reading the visa registration procedures from various resources, we're still a little confused about some of the details for our trip.</p>  <p>Basically, we'll be travelling from east to west. More specifically: our journey starts in Beijing, after which we'll hit Ulan-Bator in Mongolia for a few days, and our first stop in Russia will be Ulan Ude. From there, we'll be making our way towards Moscow over the period of 2-2.5 weeks.</p>  <p>Our main uncertainty is how to deal with registering our tourist visa along the way, from Ulan-Ude to Moscow (once we're in Moscow, we'll be staying at the same accommodation for a week, and close to another week after that in St. Petersburg, so we're confident our ho(s)tels will be able to help us out there). </p>  <p>Between Ulan-Ude and Moscow, we'll only be staying for one or two nights at a place at a time. That is, we'll get off the train, stay for one or two nights, and continue onwards west by train after that.</p>  <p>Our two main questions:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Is it fair to assume all hotels and hostels in Ulan-Ude offer a visa registration service? As far as we understand the process, we'll definitely have to register our visa within 7 days (not counting weekends and public holidays) of entering the country, regardless of how long we're staying at one location. Ulan-Ude seems to be our best option/most logical choice, but if not, what alternatives do we have? We were informed that sometimes the local UFMS or post office requires you to present a formal letter of invitation to register a visa - we don't have one, and honestly, it's sounds like a painful and time-consuming process if we were to have to do this at every stop...</p></li> <li><p>After Ulan-Ude, can we expect visa registration services from ho(s)tels in cities like Krosnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, Perm and Vladimir? Should we even bother registering if we're only staying for one or two nights at every stop, or could we cherry-pick one or two cities where registering is 'easy' (while making sure we don't exceed the 7-day period between every subsequent registration)?</p></li> </ul>  <p>We're sure we're in a pretty common situation, and we're probably worrying too much about this stuff, but for whatever reason we found little to no documentation on the appropriate course of action for this scenario. Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>  <hr>  <p>PS: We're doing this trip independently. There's no travel agency or so involved, but of course we did get our support documents through a licensed tourist agency based in Russia (based on which we were both granted a 30-day tourist visa).</p> 
44301	Is it generally true that Japanese people are more reluctant to help Asian compared to Western foreigners?	<p>I had the feeling while travelling in Japan that Japanese people in general (apart from those working at shops or public transport or accommodations) seem to show a little bit more reservation and even reluctance to help out Asian foreigners, yet they do not have such issues with Westerners. </p>  <p>I realize that this might be a little bit difficult to know for sure, but I get the feeling that Eastern 'gaijin' are held in a somewhat different regard to Western 'gaijin'. Is this true or perhaps there are some other reasons for this?</p> 
11379	Traveling to France before date of the long sejour visa	<p>I would like to travel to France before the starting date of my long sejour visa. I thought it will be no problem since I can travel to the Schengen only with my passport without asking any permission for three months as tourist, but now I was told I have to enter France exactly the date that my long sejour visa says. Is it true?</p>  <p>I have read <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10277/accepted-student-with-long-sejour-visa-ofii-to-france-but-arriving-as-tourist">this post</a> but I am not sure I found the answer.</p>  <p>Note: I have been calling the French consulate in my country since last Thursday but no one is answering the phone. I suppose they are  in holidays, but my flight is very soon so I have to know what to do as soon as possible.</p>

51849	Hidden Requirements in UK Visa Applications? (Source of evidence of funds)	<p>This post originates from a discussion with an established TSE user in <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/51829/uk-visitor-visa-refusal-possible-future-consequences">this thread</a>.</p>  <p>I applied for UK Visitor VISA for attending a competition while my father will be funding the visit. However they refused my VISA saying, "There is no evidence of the source of these funds. You have provided electricity bills but no evidence of your father's employment or income."</p>  <p>However, when I submitted the visa application I didn't find any article about about explaining unusual transaction or to explain the occupation of the person who is funding my travel. Are these hidden requirements? or buried somewhere where I didn't look?</p>

43808	Is the UK planning to introduce exit checks in 2015?	<p>Someone from America is a tourist/visitor here who has overstayed their 6 month 'leave to enter'.  In order to avoid getting caught, they are relying upon the fact that the UK does only random, sporadic exit checks on departing passengers.  In the absence of an exit check, there is no exact record of when the person left and so overstaying cannot be detected.</p>  <p>Is this likely to change in the the near future?  Will tourists leaving the UK be uniformly subjected to immigration control to assure (among other things) that they have not overstayed?  If so, when should an overstayer leave by so as not to get caught after activation?</p>

39063	Kenyan citizen refused Schengen visa from Sweden	<p>I am a Kenyan citizen. I applied for a Schengen visa, via the Swedish embassy, for visiting friends and family.  I got my results today and I was denied the visa.</p>  <p>I am a student, I will be done with my studies this month. The person who invited me (my boyfriend) was to cater for everything while I visited him.</p>  <p>I was denied a visa on the following grounds:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>   <li>Justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not provided</li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I clearly wrote in my written statement that I was going to see my man, what we would do etc.</p>  <blockquote>   <ol start="2">   <li>Your intention to leave the territory of the member states before the expiry of the visa could not be ascertained  </li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I am not employed, but I am a student and I gave a letter from school. I have a small clothing business whereby I sell items online. I did not know how to give proof of this as I do not have any tax returns on it, or business registration because it is a very small business, just something to give me some extra income as I study.</p>  <p>I also provided the following documents:</p>  <ul> <li><p>I gave my bank statements, having opened a bank account just because of applying (I did not have an account before) </p></li> <li><p>I gave a lease agreement letter for the apartment I stay in</p></li> </ul>  <p>I would like to re-apply asap because appealing is a waste of time</p>  <p>How can I improve my case above?</p>  <p>Kindly assist I know the rules for visa application is the same everywhere so there must be somebody here who has the knowledge and will be able to help me correct any mistakes that I might have made.</p>  <p><strong>Extra information</strong>:</p>  <ul> <li>My boyfriend is a Swedish citizen, born and raised. He did send an invitation with proof of income and everything, also stated that he was going to sponsor my stay and that I was going to stay with him.</li> </ul>  <p>It is very hard for somebody from a third world country to be approved a visa but not everybody who lives there wants to break the rules of another country so that they can become illegal immigrants.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Also, no, we will not have babies or get married just so that I can get a visa. Relationships don't work that way.</p></li> <li><p>Also,we have decided to appeal but with extra documentation i.e:</p>  <ol> <li>A new extended lease agreement</li> <li>I will enroll for an extra course at my university</li> <li>I'm having my parents write letters also stating they will offer any financial assistance I may need (in case of any emergency), my friends and neighbour as well (to prove social and family ties in Kenya as that was also an issue)</li> <li><em>M-pesa</em> statements&lt;&lt;--(the reason I never had a bank account before is because in Kenya we have something called <em>m-pesa</em> which is a mobile 'phone money transfer and savings service, so I conducted all my transactions there.</li> <li>Receipts for the sales I made in my business.</li> </ol></li> </ul>  <p>Will that improve my chances?</p>  <p>I am not planning on overstaying my visa. I never was and never will be. A visa to visit my boyfriend is listed under visa for friends and family.</p>  <p>P.S the new lease will be for 1 year. The new course will require graduation after my trip i.e when I get back because I'm planning on being back by January as classes will be in session - also since I'll be applying for internship, so need to be back early.</p>  <p>And, I do have a return flight booked.</p>
